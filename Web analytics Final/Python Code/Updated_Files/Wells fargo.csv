Wells Fargo,Wells Fargo Withholds Top-Level Bonuses," Mar 2, 2017",30.125,1,"Wells Fargo & Co.'s board stripped eight top executives of 2016 cash bonuses and clawed back certain stock awards in response to the bank's sales-practices scandal.The San Francisco-based lender said Wednesday that the compensation cuts for current executives don't reflect the culpability of individuals but are meant to show their accountability for the bank's overall performance and reputational risk as a result of the scandal.Eight of Wells Fargo's executives, including current Chief Executive Officer Timothy Sloan and financial chief John Shrewsberry, are affected by the moves, resulting in a loss of total compensation of about $32 million.Mr. Sloan didn't become chief executive until October when former CEO John Stumpf abruptly retired following congressional grillings and a public uproar over the sales-practices scandal that also cost the bank a $185 million settlement.Before this, Mr. Sloan was the bank's president and chief operating officer.In addition to the bonus cut, the company also said it would claw back up to 50% of the compensation the executives would have received from certain shares granted in 2014.The shares, which were tied to the company's performance, are part of executives' long-term equity incentives.In 2015, Mr. Sloan received performance share awards valued at $6.5 million, according to the bank's most recent proxy statement.Wells Fargo's board in late September rescinded a total of about $60 million in pay from Mr. Stumpf and then-retail-bank head Carrie Tolstedt.Wells Fargo also said Wednesday in its annual securities filing that more customers may have been affected by the scandal than it initially disclosed. In its September settlement, the bank, regulators and a city official said up to 2.1 million accounts were opened using fictitious or unauthorized customer information.The bank didn't give further detail on how much higher that number could be. It added in the filing that this is unlikely to significantly affect customer refund costs.The board's investigation into the scandal is continuing, and the bank reiterated it is expected to be completed before its annual shareholder meeting expected in late April.While it is unusual for banks to withhold bonuses from top executives -- incentive compensation makes up the bulk of their pay -- it has become more common in recent years."
Wells Fargo,Banks' Brighter View Drives Stocks," Mar 2, 2017",30.55,0,"Bank stocks reached their highest point in nearly 10 years on Wednesday, building on postelection gains that reflect hopes firms will soon shake free the shackles of stringent regulation, superlow interest rates and sluggish economic growth.The KBW Nasdaq Bank index, a measure of 24 of the biggest U.S. bank stocks, rose more than 3% to touch its highest level since late 2007. The gain, which followed President Donald Trump's address to Congress on Tuesday night, brought its rise since Nov. 8 to about 32%. The index has outperformed the S&P 500 by around 20 percentage points during this time.Among big banks, Bank of America has led the charge higher. It is up 50% since the election; on Wednesday the stock gained 3.6%.Investors aren't the only ones who believe the outlook for banks has changed drastically -- and for the better. Bank executives themselves are now looking to reinvest in their businesses rather than just hoping to return more capital to shareholders. That is a big change from recent years when executives were mostly in a defensive crouch.""We have the capacity to increase our balance sheet if the opportunity presents itself,"" Morgan Stanley finance chief Jonathan Pruzan told analysts earlier this year after the firm's fourth-quarter earnings report. ""That's certainly an opportunity that we haven't seen in the past.""Granted, banks' financial results haven't yet shown actual gains. Among the six biggest U.S. banks, for example, only J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. posted returns on equity for 2016 that exceeded the 10% level that investors generally consider to be a bank's cost of capital.Lighter regulation that allows banks to hold less capital could help to bolster those returns, though. And analysts are already forecasting increased profitability.Analysts' earnings-per-share expectations for 2018 for the six big banks have increased, on average, by about 11% from the end of October to the end of February.Reflecting this optimism, J.P. Morgan executives on Tuesday struck a bullish tone at the bank's annual investor day. And while the bank continues to focus on returning capital, Chief Executive James Dimon noted growth is a priority. ""The most important thing we do, bar none, is investing in our own businesses and the opportunities are everywhere to do better services, better profit-creating processes and more vision,"" he said.J.P. Morgan also said its balance sheet, which stood at $2.49 trillion at the end of last year, is likely to rise to about $2.6 trillion by the end of 2017.At Morgan Stanley, the balance sheet has shrunk to about $800 billion today from more than $1 trillion in 2007. The biggest cuts at the firm have come in its trading and banking divisions, whose share of total assets has fallen more than 18 percentage points over the past decade.Granted, if Mr. Pruzan wants to start growing the balance sheet, he will have to have capital. But that is one thing Morgan Stanley has plenty of: Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analysts estimate the firm is holding 10% more capital than it needs to pass the Federal Reserve's annual ""stress test,"" the highest proportion of any big bank.Mr. Pruzan isn't alone. Retained earnings at the six largest U.S. banks have doubled over the past five years and now make up 62% of combined total shareholders' equity, up from 44% in 2010.""For a few years, the story on capital was 'when can you return it?' but that's because there was no business opportunity to put it to use,"" UBS Group AG analyst Brennan Hawken said.Pivoting to growth mode will pose a test for bank executives. Large-scale acquisitions are still unlikely at firms labeled ""systemically important."" But there are other ways to invest.Banks could dangle incentives to lure new customer deposits, greenlight riskier trades, make more loans or buy ""smart"" ATMs in branches.One tantalizing opportunity is on trading desks, which have been slowly starved of capital in recent years. The value of financial instruments held by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., for example, has fallen by one-third since 2012, even as asset prices have risen. Smaller portfolios make it harder for traders to meet client demand; day to day, it means they say ""no"" more often than they once did.Speaking on his bank's earnings call last month, Goldman's current finance chief, Harvey Schwartz, talked of the choices that will face his successor, R. Martin Chavez, who will take over as chief financial officer in April.""If he has the chance to deploy capital back to our clients, not to return as much to shareholders, grow risk-weighted assets, those are the environments that we thrive in,"" Mr. Schwartz said. ""Ultimately, that's our preferred way to deploy capital.""At Citigroup Inc., CEO Michael Corbat said in January the bank was looking to invest in its core businesses. He singled out upgrading ""tired"" branches in Mexico and increasing its deposits and trading from hedge funds, a business that can weigh heavily on a bank's balance sheet.""It's things that we need to do,"" he said. ""We think we've got the ability not just to maintain but to grow share and to grow profitability."""
Wells Fargo,Business News: Business Watch," Mar 7, 2017",31.87,1,"EDUCATION Trump to Delay Career-School Rules The Trump administration said Monday it would delay implementing new rules designed to punish career-training schools that leave students with high levels of debt but weak job prospects. The move delays new rules known as ""gainful employment"" that formed a key piece of former President Barack Obama's higher-education agenda. It could ultimately help for-profit colleges avoid sanctions if they prove the government data underpinning the rules is flawed. The Education Department said Monday it will give schools until July 1 to file appeals, pushing back an original deadline of Friday. The rules are designed to cut off access to federal money for career-training programs if multiple classes of their graduates spend at least 20% of their discretionary income, as defined by a formula, or 8% of their total earnings each year, paying off student debt. Josh Mitchell WEATHERFORD New CEO Comes From Halliburton Weatherford International PLC named Mark McCollum, a former executive with rival Halliburton Co., as its new chairman and chief executive.Mr. McCollum will take over one the largest companies in the energy industry in April. His predecessor, Bernard J. Duroc-Danner, left in November.Weatherford has grown into an oil-field services giant through a flurry of acquisitions, but the company has struggled to recover from a series of management missteps that were compounded by a two-year downturn in oil prices that decimated its business. Despite rebounding oil prices, the company is still hamstrung by its heavy debt load.Mr. McCollum was most recently the chief financial officer of Halliburton, another big player in the energy sector.WELLS FARGO Wells Fargo & Co. named a top lawyer Monday, ending a monthslong search for a new general counsel who must help the bank recover from its sales practices scandal.

Wells Fargo,Markets &amp; Finance: Wells Fargo Shakes Up Retail Unit," Mar 10, 2017",31.98,1,"Wells Fargo & Co. took further steps this week to restructure its retail-banking business, even as the firm continues digging into the causes of its sales-practices scandal, according to employees and memos reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Some senior executives within the retail bank were demoted or had their responsibilities curtailed, according to one memo sent to employees Tuesday. This followed the firing in recent weeks of other executives as Wells Fargo continues to address the scandal that erupted last fall after it emerged that employees opened as many as 2.1 million accounts without customers' knowledge. Mary Mack, who took over the embattled retail-banking unit in July, wrote in a memo Tuesday that she was reorganizing groups within the business to expand its focus on roughly 6,000 branches across the U.S. The retail bank oversees about 78,000 employees and serves around 40 million retail-banking customers. Ms. Mack wrote in the memo, reviewed by the Journal, that while the bank has taken a number of steps to rebuild trust with customers and employees, there is still more work to do. That includes ""changes in leadership and how our organization is structured,"" she wrote. Wells Fargo sent a separate memo Tuesday to some employees alerting them that an independent consulting firm likely will contact several hundred employees about the sales-practices issues, according to the memo reviewed by the Journal. The consulting firm is reviewing the bank's controls around sales practices to try to determine the root cause of the issues. The bank is having this done as part of the regulatory consent orders it entered into in September. Meanwhile, the bank's board is continuing its own investigation into the scandal. It will share results before Wells Fargo's annual shareholder meeting April 25. In recent weeks, Ms. Mack has met with senior retail-banking executives and hinted at changes to the business that were detailed in Tuesday's memo, according to people who attended them. As part of these, two of the retail unit's top three employees, who were also lieutenants to former retail-bank head Carrie Tolstedt, had their roles diminished. Ms. Tolstedt retired in July; the bank's board subsequently clawed back some of her long-term compensation. Among the affected executives, Lisa Stevens will continue leading the retail bank's western region, which ranges from California to Iowa, but no longer will oversee small-business banking. She will continue to report to Ms. Mack. Before the scandal, many bank employees said they believed Ms. Stevens was in line to become head of retail banking. Chief Executive Timothy Sloan is one of her mentors, and executives said the two sometimes worked out together at employee events in Pasadena, Calif., near where they both live. John Sotoodeh, who took charge of the bank's troubled Los Angeles region in 2009, also was demoted. He now will oversee a region a fraction of the size of his prior role, which had included Texas, according to the memo. As a result, employees directly reporting to him will fall to an estimated 7,000 from 15,000 previously. Mr. Sotoodeh, who previously reported to Ms. Mack, now will report to Ms. Stevens. Mr. Sotoodeh was known within the bank for aggressively pushing sales, especially during Wells Fargo's ""Jump into January"" promotional event each year, and for promoting lofty goals that employees had to hit. Former employees have said that these goals prompted them to create fake accounts. Wells Fargo fired 5,300 employees over a five-year period for such behavior. Mr. Sotoodeh was also one of a group of top retail-bank executives who were warned about possible sales-practices issues as early as 2012. Former head of deposit products Ken Zimmerman, who reported to Ms. Tolstedt, wrote an email in June of that year to a number of retail-banking executives, including Mr. Sotoodeh, Ms. Stevens, Shelley Freeman and Claudia Russ Anderson. The latter two were fired by the bank a few weeks ago. The email cautioned about customers getting multiple checking accounts on the same day, an issue Wells Fargo had been looking into. ""This is something to keep an eye on,"" wrote Mr. Zimmerman, who took a leave of absence in early 2016 and left the company in July, according to a copy of the email reviewed by the Journal. ""The regional variation suggests bankers are likely driving some of this behavior"" and Wells Fargo may risk a ""customer perception that their money isn't safe."" The current and former executives didn't respond to requests for comment. Besides changing the roles of Ms. Stevens and Mr. Sotoodeh, Ms. Mack plans to name three executives to oversee new groups: one focusing on small business and the affluent, another on customer and branch experience, and a third on business strategy and administration, according to her memo. Earlier this week, the Journal reported that the bank also fired three retail-banking managers who led large regions in California and Arizona, around one level below the four executives who were earlier fired."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp; Finance: Merrill Fiduciary Shift Affects Few Customers," Mar 13, 2017",32.17,1,"Merrill Lynch's plan to potentially ease off its pledge to completely do away with commission-based retirement accounts may not provide relief to retirement clients who want to keep using Wall Street's traditional sales model. The Bank of America Corp.-owned unit told brokers that it is considering alternatives for clients in ""limited situations"" where individual retirement accounts that charge a fee based on a percentage of assets wouldn't be in their best interest, according to a memo from Merrill head Andy Sieg and viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Situations where fees charged to a retirement saver wouldn't be appropriate include accounts that have private-equity stakes or concentrated stock positions that aren't traded frequently, which would tend to include more sophisticated investors, people with knowledge of the situation said. The bulk of Merrill's retirement-paying commission savers are still expected to be steered toward fee-based accounts or Bank of America's online brokerage platform, Merrill Edge, people familiar said. The creation of an alternative product hinges on whether the Labor Department decides to delay its landmark retirement regulation, the people said. The fiduciary rule is set to take effect next month, but the Labor Department recently proposed pushing that date back to June 9 as it weighs whether to revise it. Merrill executives haven't made a final determination as to how clients would pay for the alternative product and what investments would be allowed to be bought and sold in it, the people added. Such a product would likely carry heavy restrictions on what could be bought and sold similar to those already imposed on commission-based IRAs. The restrictions on commission-based IRAs, which are meant to eliminate conflicts, include sales of mutual funds, nontraded real-estate investment trusts and life insurance products. The people familiar added that there is no guarantee an alternative product will be created. Merrill in October said it would no longer accept commissions in IRAs once the fiduciary rule, which requires brokers to put the interests of retirement savers ahead of their own, began to take effect. Merrill's decision to reconsider those plans is based on concerns voiced by its clients as well as some of its more than 14,500 brokers, the people said, stressing that those situations where fee-based arrangements wouldn't be considered appropriate would be limited. Merrill's biggest rivals didn't follow suit with the end of commission-based IRAs, with both Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co. saying they would use an exemption in the rule that permits brokerages to offer commission-based accounts to retirement savers. Michael Wong, an analyst at research firm Morningstar Inc. who focuses on the brokerage industry, said it makes sense Merrill is reconsidering its stance while the fiduciary rule is in limbo. The brokerage may have realized that certain situations, such as investors with concentrated stock positions, would have been hard to make a case for a transition from commissions to fees. ""If you can't justify the movement from a commission-based account to a fee-based account, that's a problem,"" Mr. Wong said."
Wells Fargo,Finance Watch," Mar 16, 2017",32.1,1,"WELLS FARGO CEO Pay Package Totals $12.83 Million Wells Fargo & Co. awarded Chief Executive Timothy Sloan $12.83 million in compensation for 2016 after he took over the bank this past fall following its sales practices scandal. Mr. Sloan received $2.33 million in base pay, with a bonus that included shares valued at $10.5 million. He, along with seven other executives, didn't receive a cash bonus this year compared to $1 million Mr. Sloan received for 2015 and the $4 million that his predecessor John Stumpf received in cash bonus that year. The lack of a cash bonus along with an up to 50% reduction in certain stock awards for 2016 were meant to reflect the $185 million fine the bank paid last fall for opening as many as 2.1 million accounts using fictitious or unauthorized customer information. Buyer Cuts Bid for Swiss Bank BSI The buyer of a Swiss bank caught up in corruption probes tied to Malaysia's state investment fund is seeking to cut the purchase price by about a quarter after the bank had nearly $5 billion in withdrawals in two months. BSI had 4.9 billion Swiss francs ($4.9 billion) in net asset outflows in the last two months of 2016, according to EFG International AG, the Zurich-based bank that announced its purchase of BSI last November. EFG International, which is buying BSI from Brazilian bank BTG Pactual SA, said it is seeking to pay 277.5 million francs less for BSI than the 1.06 billion franc purchase price disclosed in November. EFG had originally announced plans early last year to pay roughly 1.33 billion francs for BSI, when alleged ties between BSI employees and the corruption scandal at 1Malaysia Development Bhd., known as 1MDB, weren't clear. BTG said it ""refutes"" EFG's revised purchase price. REGULATION Spain Orders Banks To Join Operations A Spanish government-run fund told two state-owned Spanish banks to merge, an example of how countries such as Spain that bailed out failing lenders are still struggling to return those banks to private hands. Spain's bank-bailout fund, known as the Frob, on Wednesday instructed lenders Bankia SA and Banco Mare Nostrum SA to begin a merger process, after studies commissioned by the Frob revealed that a fusion would allow the Spanish state to recover the greatest amount of taxpayer funds. The Frob said the studies show that the Spanish state would bring in 401 million euros ($425.3 million) more through a merger of Bankia and BMN and subsequent stake sales than if the lenders were sold individually. As part of the studies, investment bank Societe Generale sounded out potential buyers for BMN and, according to the regulatory filing from the Frob, received only one expression of interest."
Wells Fargo,Overdraft Charges Highest Since 2009," Mar 17, 2017",32.14,1,"Banks and other financial firms in 2016 generated the highest level of fees in seven years related to overdrafts on checking accounts, marking a turnaround for a charge that crisis-era regulation tried to rein in. Overdraft fees totaled $33.3 billion in 2016, up about 2.5% from 2015 and 5.4% from 2011, according to Moebs Services Inc., an economic-research firm. Overdrafts occur when consumers make transactions that are larger than their checking-account balance. Most banks will cover the shortfall, no matter how little in savings or assets the consumer has, in exchange for what is usually a hefty fee. The 2016 fees were the highest since 2009, the year before the Federal Reserve implemented a rule that stopped banks from automatically charging consumers overdraft fees on debit-card and automated-teller-machine transactions. Instead, the rule required banks to get permission from consumers before charging a fee for such transactions. Such fees can run as high as $45 a transaction, according to Moebs Services, though the median fee across banks and other financial institutions is $30. Banks opposed the rule, warning that overdraft-fee revenue would tumble since a smaller pool of consumers would face such charges. But after initially dropping, overdraft-fee revenue remained steady at just shy of $32 billion, before starting to pick up around mid-2015, according to Moebs data, and then the 2016 growth rate was the largest annual increase since 2009. Analysts said the revenue growth isn't unusual given that the overdraft rules have been in place for some time. It ""is likely tied to new-account growth the industry is experiencing,"" said Matthew Keating, senior equity research analyst at Barclays who covers midsize banks. Some consumer advocates, though, have criticized new bank strategies to get consumers to enroll in overdraft services. Those, they say, include wrongly presenting the service as mandatory for new customers or emphasizing scenarios in which the feature could help people who are tight on cash. A survey by the Pew Charitable Trusts, a proponent of overdraft regulation, found some 52% of consumers who have paid a debit-card overdraft fee don't recall opting in to this service. Banks ""have continuous exams with regulators, and any hint of wrongdoing is something that would be picked on very quickly,"" said David Pommerehn, associate general counsel and vice president at the Consumer Bankers Association. He added that limited availability of credit for subprime borrowers has contributed to the rise in overdraft-fee revenue. Consumers with low credit scores and little to no savings are using overdraft services as a short-term financing option. Overdraft-related fee revenue at the 10 largest U.S. retail banks by assets that report these data totaled about $7.5 billion in 2016, up 4% from a year before, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Both S&P Global and Moebs data also include additional fees such as when consumers bounce checks or arrange for bill payments larger than their checking-account balance. Those transactions aren't part of the Fed's opt-in requirement, which means that checking-account users can incur them without signing up for any specific service. The increase in these figures suggests these types of transactions might be up as well. One implication of the rising revenue is that consumers may be growing more comfortable spending more than they have, even if it comes at a cost. There were nearly 1.12 billion overdraft transactions in 2016, up from nearly 1.09 billion a year earlier and 1.07 billion in 2014, according to Moebs. Another possibility is that banks are getting many new and existing customers to opt-in to overdraft services, having stepped up campaigns in branches and online promoting the feature. More enrollment generally corresponds to a larger number of overdraft transactions, said Michael Moebs, economist and chief executive at Moebs Services. Some banks' growth rate was much higher than the industry average. Wells Fargo & Co., for example, posted a 9% increase to reach $1.78 billion in overdraft-related revenue in 2016. A bank spokeswoman said this was partly due to customer growth and increased transaction activity. Several large banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and U.S. Bancorp, said year-over-year revenue increases ranging from around 1.5% to 3% resulted from account growth as more people signed up for checking accounts. Overdraft revenue is also up at credit unions. It reached a record of $6.2 billion last year, according to Moebs Services. How to Avoid Overdraft Fees Consumers are incurring more fees for spending money they don't have in their checking accounts, but there are steps they can take to avoid these charges. Overdraft fee revenue hit a seven-year high in 2016 due in part to customers' financial missteps or their decisions to bounce checks or use debit cards to pay for purchases exceeding checking-account balances. Many overdraft fees can be avoided. The Federal Reserve implemented a rule that went into effect in 2010 requiring banks and other financial institutions to get consumers' permission before they start charging overdraft fees for debit-card and automated-teller-machine transactions. As a result, banks, credit unions and other institutions typically ask consumers signing up for new checking accounts if they want to opt in to debit-card overdraft protection. Some banks present it as a way to get extra cash in an emergency. Consumers should keep in mind that by signing up for this service, they are enabling debit-card transactions to go through that can bring their account balance below zero, even when the expense isn't absolutely necessary. The median fee for this service is $30, according to economic-research firm Moebs Services. That is a major reason why consumer advocates, including the National Consumer Law Center, urge consumers to just say no to opting in. Signing up for the overdraft service doesn't keep you locked in forever. Consumers who don't want to continue should tell their bank they want out -- a request financial institutions must honor. There are other ways to incur overdraft-related fees, however, even without opting in. For instance, customers in most cases must pay the fees if their checks bounce or if they arrange for bill payments that exceed their account balance. Account holders can take several steps to avoid overdrawing, including checking their balance at least once a day. Many banks can send consumers alerts via text message or email when their balance is running low. Banks also offer several alternatives to overdrafts. One option is linking their savings account to their checking account and transferring funds to the checking account when needed. Depending on the bank, this service may be free or cost around $10 to $13 per transfer."
Wells Fargo,Markets &amp; Finance: Account Openings Decline at Wells," Mar 21, 2017",32.36,0,"Wells Fargo & Co. said Monday that its customer checking-account and credit-card openings fell drastically in February versus a year earlier, a continuing trend for the bank following last year's sales-practices scandal. The San Francisco-based bank said checking-account openings fell 43% year over year to about 300,000, while new credit-card applications fell 55% from a year earlier to about 200,000. The bank did continue to make progress in average consumer and small-business deposit balances, which rose 6% year over year to $761.4 billion. Credit-card purchase volume also increased. Customer-loyalty scores rose for the fourth consecutive month, to 57.6% but are still down from 62.1% a year earlier. Wells Fargo has been reporting monthly customer metrics since its scandal erupted in September. The bank's chief executive, Timothy Sloan, said it is part of its ""ongoing commitment to transparency."" The bank will provide its next update in April. Mary Mack, head of retail banking, added that it will take ""time for us to work through the changes we are making in our business."" Ms. Mack confirmed on a call with analysts Monday that the bank recently reorganized its retail-banking group, which The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month. She added that the bank will begin a new marketing campaign next month that highlights its offerings, following Wells Fargo's push to resume marketing in January. Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry responded to a question about the board's independent investigation of Wells Fargo, saying that he expects it will publish its findings in early to mid-April so that shareholders have time to review them before the bank's annual shareholder meeting April 25."
Wells Fargo,Affordable Housing Faces a Tax Threat," Mar 22, 2017",32.84,1,"The possibility of a U.S. tax-code overhaul is casting a shadow over the $10 billion affordable-housing industry, which receives tax credits so valuable they often determine whether or not projects get off the ground. Members of Congress and President Donald Trump have proposed reducing the corporate tax rate to 15% to 20% from the current 35%, dimming the allure of a credit investors such as big banks and insurance companies receive to offset income taxes. Affordable housing, which represents about one-quarter of all new apartment construction in the U.S., relies on the credit for capital. Developers said investors are valuing the credit 10% to 20% lower since Election Day. In some cases, investors have walked away, opening up funding gaps in projects already in motion. Because developers already walk a financial tightrope to build low-income housing, some projects are simply failing. Tax-credit values have collapsed, said Stuart Boesky, chief executive of Pembrook Capital Management LLC, a lender specializing in affordable housing. ""Some of the deals are just dying. Some of the deals are scrambling around looking for gap grants from state and local housing agencies."" The reduction in the credit's value already is likely to lead to $1 billion to $1.5 billion less equity investment in affordable housing this year, according to Novogradac & Co. LLP, an accounting firm. The tax-credit program was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1986, during the last major tax-code overhaul, to encourage more private investment in affordable housing and to move away from the traditional public-housing model. The program requires that developers set aside a certain portion of units for families making below the local-area median income and restricts the rents that they pay. In reality, most projects end up being almost entirely leased by low-income families. The value of the tax credit is two-pronged. The housing-credit program allows investors to take tax credits dollar for dollar against their federal taxes in exchange for providing funds to build affordable housing. The program offers additional value to investors because they can deduct the depreciation of the property and interest expenses. These deductions are most affected by the proposed changes. Investors are pulling back even though the timing of any tax overhaul is uncertain. Wells Fargo & Co., one of the country's largest investors in low-income housing, purchased $2.23 billion of credits in 2016. Bank executives expect that number to fall this year. Still, the tax credit has bipartisan support in Congress and is likely to survive a push to eliminate most deductions. Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington, is proposing legislation that would expand the credit by 50%, helping to offset the loss in value. The bill is co-sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp; Finance: Wells Fargo Takes Deep Dive Into Culture," Mar 22, 2017",32.72,0,"Wells Fargo & Co. has admitted it has culture problems related to its sales-practices scandal. Now, it is turning to an academic for help. Chief Executive Timothy Sloan said at a company town hall Tuesday that the bank is aiming to survey all its roughly 269,000 employees about its culture, working with an academic who specializes in this area. The bank declined to name the academic, though the 20- to 30-minute survey will roll out in May. The bank declined to say when the survey will be completed, but Mr. Sloan said the analysis and proposed actions will be shared with senior executives. He added that ""high-level results"" will be shared with bank employees. ""Our goal is to uncover our culture's positive attributes and its potential weaknesses, so our leaders can understand how best to foster an ethical, inclusive, and customer-focused culture,"" Mr. Sloan said. The push comes at an opportune time. Earlier Tuesday, a regulator continued to jab Wells Fargo about its culture problems. Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley said in remarks prepared for a speech in London that the Wells Fargo sales-practices scandal is just one example of how banks have to improve their cultures. ""There was a serious mismatch between the values Wells Fargo espoused and the incentives that Wells Fargo employed,"" Mr. Dudley said in prepared remarks. He has been one of the most outspoken regulators on bank culture in recent years. Speaking at the bank's Orlando, Fla., event, Mr. Sloan echoed the criticism. ""This is why our operating committee and I agree on this important point: If there's one thing we must get right as we lead Wells Fargo forward, it is our culture,"" he said according to prepared remarks. Wells Fargo in September paid a $185 million fine over opening as many as 2.1 million accounts using fictitious or unauthorized customer information. It has since faced a barrage of public and political criticism and investigations. Mr. Sloan said the San Francisco bank used a different type of survey for seven years about how engaged its employees are, includinghow they score on a happy-to-grumpy ratio. Since the sales-practices scandal erupted in September, the bank has sent surveys to more than 110,000 employees about its culture, Mr. Sloan said. But it wants to dig deeper. This isn't the first time Mr. Sloan addressed the culture problems facing the bank. In a late-October company town hall, he admitted ""things that need to be fixed withinour culture. There are weaknesses within it that we must change."" He said that starts with understanding where things ""broke down, and where we failed -- as a culture, a company and as leaders."" Mr. Sloan then said Wells Fargo would hire outside independent ""culture experts"" to help it understand where its weaknesses are. The bank also has said the lofty retail-banking sales goals it has since done away with drove its culture. Those changes, along with restructuring how employees are compensated, will filter through the workforce and take time to change. Wells Fargo isn't the only bank turning to academics for culture assistance. Citigroup Inc. has an on-call ethicist it consults on weighty questions of right and wrong."
Wells Fargo,Theranos Seeks No-Sue Promise," Mar 24, 2017",32.2,1,"Theranos Inc. plans to give additional shares to investors who pledge not to sue the battered blood-testing company or Elizabeth Holmes, its founder and chief executive, people familiar with the matter said. The deal includes investors who participated in Theranos's latest funding rounds, which ended in 2015 and brought in more than $600 million. Those investors could get about two additional shares for each share they bought, one of the people said. The additional shares would come from Ms. Holmes's personal stake in Theranos, some of the people said. That would result in her relinquishing her majority ownership of the closely held Palo Alto, Calif., company, some of the people said. People familiar with the deal said it was approved by Theranos's board in February. Investors are still reviewing terms of the proposed agreement, but most have signaled that they will sign off on it, these people said. ""This is an affirmative development for the company, providing a path forward in partnership with employees, investors and other stakeholders,"" said Theranos director Daniel Warmenhoven. ""Elizabeth elected to contribute her own equity to protect any dilution of shares held by other parties."" He said Ms. Holmes showed ""a level of selflessness and grace reflecting her commitment to the company's success."" The offer hasn't been publicly disclosed and follows months of negotiations with some of Theranos's largest investors, according to the people. Theranos received much of its funding from high-profile private investors who weren't part of the ecosystem that typically backs startups. They paid $15 a share to $17 a share, but the value has likely eroded sharply due to Theranos's operational and regulatory woes, which led to the closure of its two laboratories last year. The additional shares would lower the investors' effective cost to about $5 a share. Theranos reached a separate agreement to buy back the shares purchased in early 2015 by Rupert Murdoch for about $125 million, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Murdoch is executive chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox Inc. News Corp is the parent of The Wall Street Journal. Under the terms of that deal, Theranos agreed to pay Mr. Murdoch a nominal amount equal to a tiny fraction of the original purchase price, the people said. One person familiar with the matter said the amount was just $1. Mr. Murdoch could be entitled to an additional payment under certain circumstances, one person said. According to people familiar with the matter, he had refused to join the broad agreement with investors and wanted to sell his shares to Theranos so he could take an investment loss for tax purposes, potentially saving millions of dollars in taxes owed on other income. Tax experts said Mr. Murdoch wouldn't have been able to claim the deduction without finding a buyer for his Theranos shares. ""We get to realize losses when we make bad investments, but one has to exit to do that,"" said Michael Knoll, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Other investors who purchased shares during Theranos's later funding rounds include the family of U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the Waltons of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and John Elkann, the Italian industrialist who controls Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. Representatives of those investors didn't respond to requests for comment Thursday. Partner Fund Management LP, a San Francisco hedge fund that sued Theranos in October, isn't participating in the investor agreement, people familiar with the matter said. The hedge fund has alleged that Theranos fraudulently solicited a $96 million investment through misleading statements about the company's capabilities. Theranos has said it is fighting the lawsuit. Theranos shareholders who invested in earlier funding rounds wouldn't be included in the deal and haven't been told about it by the company, several of them told the Journal. After the Journal raised questions about Theranos's technology and practices, federal health regulators last year investigated and revoked the testing license from Theranos's main lab and banned Ms. Holmes from the lab industry for at least two years. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department launched investigations of the company. Theranos has said it is cooperating with the probes and appealing the regulatory sanctions, which are on hold pending the outcome of those proceedings. It exited the lab business in October, saying it was retrenching to focus on developing new testing technology to sell to other companies. In November, drugstore giant Walgreen Co. alleged Theranos had breached a contract between the companies. Theranos has said the allegations are unfounded and is fighting a suit filed by the Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. unit.Other recent changes at Theranos include the departure of litigator David Boies and former Wells Fargo & Co. Chief Executive Richard Kovacevich from Theranos's board, according to a person familiar with the matter.The departures haven't been announced, and the company's website on Thursday afternoon still listed the two men as directors.Theranos will add to its board a representative of the late-stage investors, this person said. Ms. Holmes also is a Theranos director.Mr. Boies has long been one of the country's best-known litigators and fiercely defended Theranos. Those efforts included threatening to take legal action against the Journal during the months before it published in October 2015 its first article detailing problems at the company.He planned to resign from the board last summer but stayed on after other directors said his departure would send dire signals about Theranos, a person familiar with the matter said.At the end of last year, Theranos had $200 million of cash on hand, not including $40 million in debt to Walgreens that is part of the two companies' legal dispute, Theranos told shareholders in a January conference call. One person familiar with the matter said Theranos now has about $150 million or less in cash, excluding the debt."
Wells Fargo,Regulators Approve Smaller Banks' 'Wills'," Mar 25, 2017",32.18,1,"WASHINGTON -- U.S. regulators gave 15 regional banks a passing grade on their ""living will"" plans for bankruptcy, a victory for those firms that demonstrates how their regulatory environment is significantly less stressful than for the largest U.S. banks. The verdicts from the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. mean regional banks -- including U.S. Bancorp, PNC Financial Services Group Inc. and Capital One Financial Corp. -- have for the moment satisfied regulators that they have feasible plans for going through bankruptcy without needing a taxpayer bailout. The plans, known as ""living wills,"" are required under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law. The exercise is significant for banks because if regulators don't approve of them, sanctions such as higher capital requirements or forced breakups can be imposed. This is the first time regulators have issued a judgment about regional banks' plans. The firms will have to continue submitting plans in the future. The one exception Friday was Northern Trust Corp. Regulators said they concluded that firm has ""a number of shortcomings"" in its living will, related to the funding and internal services available to keep the firm operating during a bankruptcy. They required the firm to address the perceived shortcomings by the end of this year. A Northern Trust spokesman said the bank ""maintains a strong financial position"" and has been making improvements since it submitted its living will to regulators. The positive verdict for the regional banks stands in contrast to outcomes for eight of the largest U.S. banks. In April 2016, the Fed and FDIC concluded all eight of those firms had shortcomings in their plans and saw problems so severe in five of the firms that they said the plans didn't meet the Dodd-Frank standard. In December 2016, regulators said most of those firms had addressed their concerns. They also said Wells Fargo & Co. hadn't and restricted some of the firm's business activities. Also Friday, regulators gave four large foreign-owned banks guidance about how to improve their living wills. Those firms will have until July 2018 to conform plans to the guidance. The firms are Barclays PLC, Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG and UBS Group AG."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp; Finance: Wells Community-Investing Rating Is Cut --- Bank cites consent orders related to sales-practice scandal for regulatory action," Mar 29, 2017",32.11,0,"Wells Fargo & Co. said Tuesday that it was downgraded on a key regulatory rating that focuses on its ability and willingness to lend to, invest in and service lower-income populations. The San Francisco bank received a ""needs to improve"" Community Reinvestment Act rating because of its regulatory consent orders related to its sales-practices scandal, the bank said. Wells Fargo added in a securities filing Tuesday that the rating results in the loss of expedited processing of applications for certain activities. The bank also must receive prior regulatory approval for other activities, such as issuing or prepaying certain debt, opening or relocating bank branches or making certain investments. The rating could affect the bank's relationships with certain states, counties, municipalities or other public agencies. A spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which conducts the Community Reinvestment Act evaluations, said the agency doesn't comment on them. The CRA rating covered 2009 to 2012. The bank has been looking as far back as 2009 and 2010 to uncover consumer financial harm related to its aggressive sales tactics. In September, it paid a $185 million fine and was dealt regulatory consent orders for opening as many as 2.1 million accounts using fictitious or unauthorized customer information. In congressional hearings in September, politicians grilled now-former Chief Executive John Stumpf about whether more vulnerable customer segments, including lower-income populations, were affected more than others. A spokeswoman said Tuesday the bank doesn't collect race and ethnicity information for deposit and credit-card accounts. Also on Tuesday, Wells Fargo said it has reached a $110 million tentative agreement to resolve a class-action complaint tied to its sales practices scandal. The latest settlement proposal, which requires court approval, would cover customers who allege similar practices starting in Jan. 1, 2009. Wells Fargo has for the past several months been refunding money to customers who incurred costs from unwanted accounts or cards. On the CRA rating, Wells Fargo CEO Timothy Sloan said in a statement the bank is ""disappointed with this rating given Wells Fargo's strong track record of lending to, investing in and providing service to low- and moderate-income communities."" He added that the bank is committed to addressing the OCC's concerns.The Wall Street Journal in December reported that this downgrade would be likely.In the last two years, the OCC and other bank regulators have more aggressively lowered other banks' ratings, including last year those of Fifth Third Bancorp and Regions Financial Corp., based on the rule, which has been around for decades"
Wells Fargo,Citizens Financial Staff Cite Made-Up Meetings," Mar 30, 2017",32.13,1,"As part of its turnaround plan, Citizens Financial Group Inc. has touted a program that invites customers into branches for what the bank calls a financial checkup. It said 400,000 such meetings were scheduled last year. Eleven current and former Citizens branch employees in five states claim that information about some meetings was fabricated by those employees or others as they struggled to meet goals set by the bank. ""For a week or so, I had my bankers [try to make] real appointments. No one was picking up the phone,"" said a former branch manager in Massachusetts, recalling when the ""Citizens Checkup"" program was introduced in February 2016. ""So we put random people's names down and said, 'We have an appointment.' "" After a fake appointment was supposed to have occurred, bankers would either sometimes mark that the customer didn't show up or attended but didn't sign up for any new products, the former employees said. One former Citizens branch manager in New York state recalled putting stars or exclamation points on falsified forms to make them look like authentic meeting notes. Citizens said in a statement that it has ""no data to suggest that any aspect of the Citizens Checkup program was fabricated or falsified"" and has ""strict controls and standards to ensure that inappropriate behavior is detected and addressed."" Brad Conner, head of consumer banking at Citizens, said in a separate statement that, ""We take every allegation seriously, and our chief conduct officer will lead a thorough review."" The bank added any new program entails change and that, ""as expected, a small number of colleagues have struggled in making the transition to having deep needs-based conversations."" The former Citizens employees said they falsified information because of pressure to meet expectations related to the program and time constraints from other banking responsibilities. They also said they believed that doing so wouldn't hurt customers. In response, Citizens said, ""While all of our colleagues go through significant training to be prepared for conducting a checkup, this new approach may not suit everyone, which may explain why you identified a handful of detractors."" Providence, R.I.-based Citizens has more than $149 billion in assets and 1,200 branches in 11 states, primarily in the Northeast; it is the 10th-largest U.S. commercial bank by assets. Since going public in 2014, Citizens, a former unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, has worked to turn around its business by improving profitability and increasing revenue. Banks, investors and regulators have been scrutinizing bank-sales programs since a scandal over sales tactics erupted last fall at Wells Fargo & Co. Some firms have played down sales goals since then, though Citizens has continued to emphasize its appointment program and other sales goals, according to current and former employees. The information that the current and former Citizens employees said was falsified doesn't involve opening customer accounts without consent, the practice that led to Wells Fargo's problems. But the claims by current and former employees that information was falsified at Citizens could raise questions about the accuracy of data the bank presented to investors and about the bank's corporate culture and internal controls. ""Investors are potentially hurt if executives go out and talk to the Street about basically phantom appointments that don't exist,"" said Clifford Rossi, a professor at the University of Maryland's business school. The appointment-setting program was part of a broader push to bring in more than $60 million in new revenue for 2016. Citizens had total revenue of $5.3 billion last year. Last June, Mr. Conner told investors at a conference that the initiative was ""near the top of the things that we're most excited about."" Mr. Conner added at that time, ""We've contacted over 300,000 -- about 325,000 of our customers. We've been able to schedule 80,000 appointments for a checkup, and we're getting really great feedback from both our customers and our colleagues in terms of the receptivity from our customer base."" Citizens has also presented data on the appointments in materials accompanying quarterly earnings. The bank told The Wall Street Journal that figures on the program presented to investors weren't overstated and that those metrics were ""not a key financial measure."" To make appointments, Citizens' staffers cold-call customers, the bank said. The goal, current and former employees said, was to eventually sell more banking products. Citizens' push for customer appointments reflects Chief Executive Bruce Van Saun's stated desire for branches to become advice centers. The bank said a two-part phone survey of nearly 1,000 customers who were called for a checkup appointment found 95% who kept the appointment said the meeting was useful. The bank also said in response to questions from the Journal that surveys of its own branch employees haven't turned up evidence of widespread staff dissatisfaction with the checkups. The 11 current and former branch employees, however, said the program ran into problems. For starters, few customers picked up the phone -- and of those that did, not many wanted an appointment, the bankers said. A former Citizens banker in New York state said he was initially enthusiastic after going through specialized training. But no matter how he pitched it in calls in the spring of 2016, ""people still felt it was a telemarketer call,"" said the banker. ""We feel good about our sales practices, and the checkup approach is an important element of why we do,"" the bank said. Bankers, who were often told by managers to make 25 cold calls a day, were given a script, some of the current and former bankers said. If a customer wasn't interested, the bank suggested in the script reviewed by the Journal that the banker say: ""Just like you would meet with a doctor or dentist every six months or year it is important to review your financial health as well."" At some branches, calls were expected to yield between 10 and 15 checkup appointments per banker per week, some of the current and former bankers said. The bank disputes the goal figures for calls and appointments. It said that, while individual branches set their own expectations, it is more typical for 30 calls and two kept appointments a week to be expected of bankers. Nine current and former employees said they or others would typically enter false information into two computer systems, one tracking calls to customers, the other for appointments made, former bankers said. First, employees would mark that they called customers even though they hadn't. Next, the employees said, they or others would enter fake appointments into the system using the names of actual customers. Two former Citizens bankers said they often marked that a customer didn't show up for the checkup or didn't buy any products. The bank said it had worked with a consultant to track the progress of its program against those of other banks with similar arrangements. It added this didn't show anything amiss."
Wells Fargo,Quarterly Profits Seen Strongest Since 2011," Apr 5, 2017",31.63,1,"U.S. companies are poised to report their strongest quarterly earnings in years, another sign that the stock-market rally could have further to run. Analysts expected earnings for S&P 500 companies to grow by 9.1% overall in the first quarter from a year earlier, as of March 31, which would mark the highest growth since the fourth quarter of 2011, according to FactSet. Still, analysts have trimmed their profit expectations since the start of the year, and disappointing results could stoke concerns that stock-price gains have outpaced earnings growth. Reporting season heats up over the next few weeks, with banks including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. expected to report results next week and giants like Johnson & Johnson, Verizon Communications Inc. and General Electric Co. scheduled the week after. Investors have been betting that U.S. corporate profits will soar this year, supercharged by a Trump agenda that includes tax cuts and looser regulations. Last month's collapse of the Republican health-care bill cast doubt on such policies, but a strong earnings season could give investors a reason to keep investing in stocks. Technology companies, among the best performers in the stock market this year, are expected to post some of the biggest earnings gains. Meanwhile, profits at industrial companies are projected to contract, potentially weighing on a sector that has lagged behind the broader S&P 500 this year after outperforming in the postelection rally. ""The buying and closing your eyes bit -- that part's gone,"" said Bret Chesney, senior portfolio manager at Alpine Global Management LLC. ""I think now is when we really start to be dependent on what the hard numbers show."" Apple Inc., whose stock is up 25% this year, was expected to report per-share earnings of $2.02 for its latest quarter as of March 31, up from $1.90 a share in the year-earlier period. Shares of the world's most valuable company hit a record this year partly on bets that its 10th-anniversary iPhone, expected later this year, will keep momentum building at the firm. The company posted a profit in January after three consecutive quarters of declines. Apple declined to comment. Oil prices also have rebounded from their 2016 lows, a factor that should help energy companies -- the biggest laggards in previous earnings seasons -- improve results. Energy companies are expected to be the biggest contributors to earnings growth for the first quarter -- accounting for more than a third of the broader index's projected gains, according to FactSet. Revenue also is expected to pick up for S&P 500 companies overall, after many had relied on cost-cutting to improve profits during the recovery from the financial crisis -- an encouraging sign for some investors who were looking for more sustainable growth. For the first quarter, S&P 500 firms are projected to report revenue growth of 7.1%, the biggest jump in more than five years, according to FactSet. Improving corporate health and U.S. economic data have supported stocks since the second half of last year, helping the rally weather shifts in fiscal-policy expectations. Over the past year, S&P 500 companies have rebounded from a five-quarter earnings slump, wage growth has firmed and consumer confidence has risen to a more than 16-year-high. A dollar rally, which some worried would cut into exporters' profits, has stalled this year after a postelection surge. Analysts have pared back their expectations for first-quarter earnings since the start of the year, but the cuts have been smaller than the average over the past five years, according to FactSet. As of year-end, analysts estimated first-quarter earnings growth would be 12.5%. But disappointing earnings could dent stocks' recent gains. Shares of industrial and materials companies, which helped lead the rally between Election Day and the end of 2016, posted the largest declines since then in expected earnings. As of March 31, analysts expected General Electric to post first-quarter per-share earnings of 17 cents, down from the 21 cents it reported a year earlier, according to FactSet. Analysts had expected first-quarter earnings of 29 cents per share at the end of 2016. The company -- whose stock is down 5% this year after a 7.4% advance between Election Day and year-end -- has faced pressure from activist investors to slash expenses after missing profit targets last year, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Mining firm Freeport-McMoRan Inc. was expected March 31 to post earnings of 18 cents a share for the first quarter, compared with a loss of 16 cents a year earlier but down from analysts' year-end estimate of 41 cents a share, according to FactSet. The company said in March that, because of a standoff with regulators, it had to scale back output and lay off workers in Indonesia, where it derives roughly a third of its copper output. Its stock is up 2.7% this year after rising 9.1% between Election Day and the end of 2016. GE and Freeport declined to comment. Still, company management has been upbeat. S&P 500 firms used the word ""optimistic"" in 52% of earnings calls for the fourth-quarter earnings season, the most ever in Bank of America Merrill Lynch data going back to 2003. At the same time, company-issued guidance was ""nothing to write home about,"" the firm noted. The gap between firms' confidence and their future earnings estimates reflects a concern among some investors and analysts: That stocks have run up at a pace beyond what is warranted by earnings results. Major indexes' gains since November have made them even more expensive relative to their historical valuations, raising some concerns that they could be vulnerable to a pullback."
Wells Fargo,Apple Pay Struggles to Gain Traction," Apr 6, 2017",31.48,1,"Nancy Schrum watched curiously as a colleague from her law firm waved an iPhone above a credit-card reader to buy a Subway sandwich with Apple Pay earlier this year. ""I have that, but I'm afraid to use it,"" said Ms. Schrum of York, Pa., who feared the technology wouldn't work. When Apple Inc. launched its mobile-payment service more than two years ago, it hoped to speed up the checkout process and, ultimately, to replace physical wallets for U.S. consumers. Apple Pay has made significant headway, but Ms. Schrum's wariness reflects a range of factors that analysts say have caused growth to undershoot their expectations, including security concerns about the service, retailers that don't accept it, and Apple's relatively paltry marketing. The pace of Apple Pay adoption has been ""disappointing even to conservative expectations,"" said Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures, a venture-capital firm specializing in tech research. Just 13% of the estimated 680 million iPhone users have used Apple Pay, according to the research firm. Eddy Cue, Apple senior vice president in charge of internet software and services, said the service has been adopted faster than other payment systems and he believes it will eventually replace cash, debit and credit cards as the primary payment system. ""Does it matter if we get there in two years, three years [or] five years?"" Mr. Cue said in an interview. ""Ultimately, no."" The service requires users to upload their credit or debit card to their iPhone wallet by scanning an image of it. To pay at the checkout line, they hold the phone -- or Apple Watch -- above a contactless payment terminal that uses a technology known as near-field communication to transmit the card's information. Fingerprint verification is required for security. The service can also be used to pay in apps and online. Many U.S. consumers remain wary of such a service, according to technology research firm Creative Strategies: 40% are concerned about the security risks of adding a credit or debit card to their phone, and more than 60% aren't familiar with contactless payments. Compounding Apple Pay's challenges, only a third of U.S. stores accept it as a form of payment, according to the Nilson Report. The payment-industry trade publication notes, however, that the service's rate of acceptance has more than doubled since 2015. ""If you can't use it everywhere, why are you going to switch?"" said Braden More, Wells Fargo & Co.'s head of partnerships and industry relations, who expresses surprise that more retailers haven't embraced mobile payments. He expects acceptance and usage to grow. Big names including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Kroger Co. haven't yet enabled Apple Pay, due in part to technical hurdles, and even at stores that do use the service, users say cashiers often aren't familiar with it. Paul Davis said he recently had to inform a McDonald's cashier in Cincinnati that the burger chain accepted Apple Pay and show her how. ""It happens all the time,"" he said. Vice President of Apple Pay Jennifer Bailey said Apple has a team working with merchants to instruct cashiers and add instructions to checkout manuals. She said more than half of the biggest 100 merchants in the U.S. have adopted Apple Pay, including Best Buy Co., Kohl's Corp. and Starbucks Corp. Loup Ventures' Mr. Munster, a longtime Apple analyst previously with brokerage Piper Jaffray Co., estimates Apple Pay last year handled $36 billion in transactions, far less than the $207 billion he had predicted by 2016 after Apple started the service. Apple doesn't disclose the number or value of Apple Pay transactions, but Chief Executive Tim Cook recently said the number of users has tripled over the past year and transaction volume increased more than sixfold last year. Apple Pay brought in $30 million in revenue last year, according to Sanford C. Bernstein -- a fraction of the $24.35 billion generated last fiscal year by Apple's services unit, which also comprises Apple's App store and iTunes. The company announced in January it aimed to double its services revenue by 2021. Apple Pay generates revenue from charging banks a slice of each transaction, often 0.15% per credit-card transaction and a half cent per debit-card purchase."
Wells Fargo,Business &amp; Finance," Apr 6, 2017",32.1,1,"GE is weighing a sale of its lighting unit, the latest move in the conglomerate's pivot away from consumer businesses. The Fed agreed at its March meeting that it would likely begin shrinking a $4.5 trillion securities portfolio later this year.

Wells Fargo,Wells Uncovers More Abuses --- Internal probe finds false reporting in card-processing work for small businesses," Apr 6, 2017",32.33,0,"Wells Fargo & Co. has overhauled its credit-card-processing business after an internal probe found some employees falsely reported customers' sales and pushed small firms into costly contracts they didn't understand. The bank has fired at least two dozen employees of Wells Fargo Merchant Services LLC in the past two years for those and other bank-policy violations, according to current managers. Wells Fargo also restructured the group last fall to reduce the incentives for using aggressive sales tactics, the executives said. The actions, which haven't been previously reported, show how Wells Fargo's sales-tactics problems extended beyond its consumer bank. That business was hit by last fall's revelation that employees opened as many as 2.1 million consumer-banking accounts without customers' knowledge to meet lofty sales goals. Wells Fargo discovered the full scale of abuses in the merchant-services business after undertaking a broad examination of the bank's business practices in light of the account-opening scandal. Wells Fargo said it has taken ""significant steps"" over the past several years to strengthen Wells Fargo Merchant Services, its merchant-processing unit for credit- and debit-card payments. The bank had fired some merchant-processing employees before the wider scandal broke last fall. After taking a deeper look into the business in the wake of those problems, it terminated several other employees and revamped the division. Merchant processing, which involves helping businesses handle debit- and credit-card transactions for customers, might seem like a mundane business. But small-business owners and industry participants say high-pressure sales tactics are common. They add that complex pricing structures and costly early-termination penalties that can lock customers into contracts are also prevalent. Merchant processors collected about $18.15 billion in debit- and credit-card fees from merchants in 2016, according to the Nilson Report, a newsletter tracking the payments industry. Banks such as Wells Fargo, Bank of America Corp. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. are among the biggest players. Wells Fargo fired some staff in this business for policy violations after uncovering evidence that employees coached branch bankers to put false information into the bank's systems about small-business customers' sales, the current managers said. Firms with annual sales of less than $750,000 seeking to open accounts were automatically routed to call centers, under Wells Fargo policies at the time. To earn commissions, sales representatives sometimes inflated sales figures so they surpassed the threshold. As part of its broader overhaul of sales tactics last fall, the bank ended the practice of allowing retail-branch bankers to refer small-business customers to merchant-services employees without manager consent. That has caused referrals to the merchant-services unit to fall more than 50%, a former employee said."
Wells Fargo,"Investing in Funds &amp; ETFs: A Quarterly Analysis --- Regulation: 5 Things Mutual-Fund Investors Should Know About New 'T' Shares --- With the retirement rule that spurred these shares now delayed, demand might not materialize"," Apr 10, 2017",32.42,1,"Mutual-fund T shares are on their way. But nobody knows exactly when. The shares -- the ""T"" is short for ""transaction"" -- were designed to comply with the new Labor Department fiduciary rule that its creators say is aimed at mitigating the conflicts of interest that crop up among financial advisers. One of the biggest: Advisers may recommend a higher-cost fund over a less-expensive option so that they'll get paid more. T shares aim to help remove that temptation by featuring uniform sales charges across all fund categories. No difference in price, no financial incentive to push one fund over another. But the fiduciary rule, originally set to go into effect April 10, is under review at the direction of President Donald Trump and the implementation has been delayed for at least 60 days. With the uncertainty, some fund companies have put on the brakes. They're not sure how much demand there will be from brokers -- so they're holding off on launching new T shares for now. (By the way, unrelated funds called T shares -- standing for ""tax"" -- already exist. Fidelity Investments renamed its old T shares as M shares, effective March 24, to avoid confusion. And Janus Capital Group has offered T shares, or ""third-party"" shares -- no-load shares sold by third-party intermediaries. At this point, it has no plan to rename those shares.) Here are five things for mutual-fund investors to know about the new share classes: 1. T Shares Could Replace Other Options Typically, T shares would charge a 2.5% load, or upfront sales fee, when sold, and a so-called 12b-1 fee of 0.25% to pay for distribution or other expenses, according to researcher Morningstar Inc. The front-end load may decline for larger purchases. In comparison, the maximum up-front load on an A share class is often 5% or more, according to Morningstar. In addition, loads on A shares vary tremendously -- and that concerns the Labor Department, as it may create a conflict of interest because advisers might have an incentive to push higher-load offerings, says Aron Szapiro, director of policy research at Morningstar Inc. ""We think that, should the fiduciary rule go forward unchanged, [T shares] probably will largely replace A shares, at least in the retirement marketplace,"" he says. 2. Some T Shares Are Already Available . . . About 50 T shares for 50 existing funds have already been launched by two firms -- Calamos Investments and Aegon's Transamerica unit -- and shares for 234 more from nine fund companies are expected to be launched between now and May, Morningstar says. An additional 78 fund companies have filed with regulators to launch 876 additional T shares, though no inception date has been set, Morningstar says. 3. . . .But Many Firms Are Waiting for Now Some fund companies have filed to launch T shares, and are prepared to move quickly if the fiduciary rule is implemented. But they're remaining on hold until there's more clarity from the Labor Department. ""Our members also would like to know the DOL's decision about revising or rescinding the rule, following President Trump's directive,"" says David Blass, general counsel of the Investment Company Institute. Fidelity filed with regulators to launch new T shares on 28 of its mutual funds in February. But at this point, ""a launch date is to be determined,"" a spokesman for Fidelity says. Nuveen Investments also has filed with regulators for permission to launch T shares, but has no specific plans to launch them or to withdraw its filing. Lord, Abbett & Co. LLC has applied for T shares and had them approved by regulators, but they're now on hold until it sees where the fiduciary rule is headed, a spokesman says. ""Depending on the outcome of the DOL rule, and if there is a continued demand by our partners in the marketplace, we would offer them,"" he says. Meanwhile, brokerage firms also say that they'll wait to see how the Labor Department deals with the fiduciary rule. ""At this point, we haven't decided how we're going to proceed on the share classes,"" says a spokesman for Morgan Stanley. ""We'll talk to our asset-management partners once we have more clarity on how the DOL fiduciary rule is evolving or how it evolved."" The brokerage arm of Wells Fargo & Co. also hasn't made a decision as to when it will offer T shares, a spokeswoman for the firm says. 4. T Shares Don't Satisfy Everyone Over time, investors -- who typically jump from fund to fund -- are likely to save money with T shares, says Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual-fund research at financial data and analysis provider CFRA. But some have criticized the share classes because, although their fees may be level across funds, brokers would still be selling clients funds with loads when superior no-load funds may exist. ""Less gouging is still gouging, and less self-dealing is still self-dealing, and doesn't satisfy the fiduciary requirement,"" says David Marotta, president of Marotta Wealth Management, a fee-only registered investment-advisory firm in Charlottesville, Va. ""Find me any fund that has a high sales charge, and I'll find you a better mix of low-fee funds."" 5. Alternatives Are Emerging Some fund companies are planning another type of share class that could address the Labor Department's conflict concerns. They've designed what are known as clean shares, which include fees for investment management and administrative costs, but are stripped of the fees charged by those who sell the funds to investors, such as broker-dealers. With clean shares, brokers would set their own commissions for selling the shares, which makes it easier for investors to see what they're paying for. Lord Abbett, for example, last week launched what it calls F3 shares, which charge management fees, but no fees to pay distributors. Capital Group's American Funds also offers F3 shares.Janus has filed to launch P shares, which are similar to other firms' new T shares. When they will be offered is uncertain at this point."
Wells Fargo,Wells Slams Former Bosses' High-Pressure Sales Tactics," Apr 11, 2017",32.03,0,"A new report on the sales scandal at Wells Fargo & Co. portrayed its former chief executive as a tone-deaf leader who protected an irresponsible lieutenant and worked for board members who didn't keep the pair in check. The report, a long-awaited investigation of a scandal that ensnared the bank with regulators and politicians this past September, also said Wells Fargo's board will claw back an additional $75 million in pay from former Chief Executive John Stumpf and the lieutenant, former retail-bank chief Carrie Tolstedt. The latest decisions on pay brought the total money clawed back from current and former Wells Fargo executives to $182.8 million, an amount that rivals the fine the bank paid last year and that its board described as the largest clawback ever for any financial-services firm. The 113-page report, released Monday, is likely to be the board's final deep dive into the questionable conduct that dated back to 2002 and ultimately resulted in a $185 million penalty last year. It likely won't be the final discussion, however, of the high-pressure sales strategy that led to as many as 2.1 million accounts being created using fictitious or unauthorized customer information. ""The Board's report is a necessary examination of what went wrong in our culture, operations, and governance,"" Wells Fargo CEO Timothy Sloan said in a statement. ""I wish we would've taken more action and done things more quickly,"" Mr. Sloan said later on a call with reporters. The San Francisco-based bank continues to face federal and state investigations about its sales practices. And last week, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. suggested Wells Fargo investors vote against 12 of the bank's 15 directors at the firm's annual meeting April 25. In Monday's report, prepared by a board committee of independent directors and law firm Shearman & Sterling LLP, much of the blame fell on Mr. Stumpf and his protege, Ms. Tolstedt. A lawyer for Ms. Tolstedt, Enu Mainigi of Williams & Connolly LLP, said: ""We strongly disagree with the report and its attempt to lay blame with Ms. Tolstedt. A full and fair examination of the facts will produce a different conclusion."" Mr. Stumpf's lawyer declined to comment. Mr. Stumpf last fall apologized and in congressional hearings took responsibility for the scandal. The report also highlighted how the bank's push to boost revenue and profit trickled down to thousands of employees who felt pressured to meet unrealistic sales goals. One Wells Fargo branch manager, for example, had a teenage daughter with 24 accounts, an adult daughter with 18, a husband with 21, a brother with 14 and a father with four. Ms. Tolstedt was singled out 142 times in the report for setting the tone in the troubled retail-banking unit. At one point, she is described as being ""scared to death"" of hurting her unit's sales figures. The board decided last week to claw back Ms. Tolstedt's outstanding stock options valued at about $47.3 million. It also is taking away -- through scheduled retirement benefits -- an additional $28 million of incentive compensation paid to Mr. Stumpf in March 2016. The board's review caps a six-month investigation that not only has rocked Wells Fargo but the broader banking industry, with dozens of firms examining their own sales practices at the behest of regulators. Years of aggressive sales tactics in pockets around the country led to Wells Fargo's September settlement. Since then politicians, regulators and customers among others, have criticized the bank. In February, it reached a preliminary settlement for $110 million over a customer class action case. Other state and federal investigations are continuing and the bank has said it is cooperating. Improper sales issues began to escalate within Wells Fargo as far back as 2002, the report noted, years earlier than the bank has agreed to check for consumer harm. The bank has said it is going back an additional two years beyond the 2011-to-2016 time frame regulators called for in last year's consent orders. Mr. Sloan said Monday that Wells Fargo will make things ""right"" with customers who reach out to the bank with problems related to the sales practices, regardless of the timing. By 2004, a Wells Fargo's internal investigations employee wrote to executives in that group about sales issues, according to the report. As early as 2012, some top Wells Fargo retail banking and risk executives knew the firm had a problem with its strategy of ""cross selling"" multiple products to the same customers. The issue gained more exposure with a Los Angeles Times story on the topic and a 2015 lawsuit by the Los Angeles City Attorney. The board's efforts to understand the scope of the issues were hampered by the ""insular and defensive"" way in which Ms. Tolstedt ran her division, as well as Mr. Stumpf's loyalty to her, the report said. Mr. Stumpf ""was by nature an optimistic executive who refused to believe that the sales model was seriously impaired,"" the report said. ""He was too late and too slow to call for inspection of or critical challenge to the basic business model."" In late 2015, key board members including lead independent director Stephen Sanger pushed Mr. Stumpf to remove Ms. Tolstedt from her role. But Mr. Stumpf declined, saying that Ms. Tolstedt, while at times controlling, was ""the best banker in America,"" the report said. Ms. Tolstedt ultimately left her role in July 2016. Mr. Stumpf abruptly retired in October."

Wells Fargo,KPMG Fires Five Partners Over Leak --- Firm says it improperly obtained information about audits regulator planned to inspect," Apr 12, 2017",31.87,0,"Five KPMG LLP partners, including the head of its audit practice, were fired after the Big Four accounting firm improperly obtained information about which audits its regulator planned to inspect, the company said. The company's regulator, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, began investigating a leak discovered in February of its plans to inspect KPMG's work. Among the fired KPMG employees was Scott Marcello, who was a partner and headed the audit practice, the company said. An employee of the accounting board who leaked the information to KPMG left the PCAOB after the leak was reported to the regulator, which oversees firms that audit U.S.-traded public companies, according to the PCAOB. The firm on Tuesday confirmed the role of its executives and their firings after being contacted by The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Marcello didn't respond to requests for comment. Also among those fired was David Middendorf, KPMG's national managing partner for audit quality and professional practice, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Middendorf couldn't immediately be reached for comment. The identities of the other fired partners weren't known Tuesday evening. The company said it also dismissed a sixth employee, whose identity and role couldn't be learned. The breach is the latest incident that spotlights concerns about and challenges at KPMG and the other Big Four accounting firms. KPMG audits Wells Fargo & Co. and has faced questions about why it didn't uncover the bank's sales-practice scandal before the lender reached a $185 million settlement with regulators last fall. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, another member of the Big Four, also faced a trial on allegations by MF Global Holdings Ltd. that bad advice from the accounting firm had contributed to MF Global's collapse. The claims were resolved with a confidential settlement between the parties. The accounting board, which is investigating the actions of its former employee, hired an outside law firm to examine the incident, according to people familiar with the matter. The board was created by Congress after the accounting scandals that took down Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc. to exclusively police the audits of listed companies' financial results. Its employees earn some of the highest salaries among all financial regulators, a practice designed to discourage them from switching sides and going to work for the audit firms. The KPMG employee who received the leak formerly worked at the accounting board, according to the audit firm. The company said the person received ""improper advance warnings of engagements to be inspected,"" and shared it with other KPMG executives. KPMG says it told both the accounting board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the board, about the leak as soon as it was discovered. ""KPMG has zero tolerance for such unethical behavior,"" said Lynne Doughtie, KPMG's chairman and CEO. ""KPMG is committed to the highest standards of professionalism, integrity and quality, and we are dedicated to the capital markets we serve. We are taking additional steps to ensure that such a situation should not happen again."" A spokeswoman for the accounting board said the organization has taken steps to ""maintain and reinforce the integrity of its inspection process"" since discovering the leak. The leaked information relates to annual inspections the accounting board performs of each of the major accounting firms, reviewing dozens of a firm's audits to gauge performance and compliance with auditing rules. Inspections are particularly sensitive because they are the board's primary means of assessing audit quality. Inspectors can fault the accounting firms for deficiencies, and the findings are widely seen as a report card for how the firms are performing and whether audit quality is getting better or worse. The accounting board's inspections tend to focus on the most difficult businesses and transactions, ones in which it believes accountants may have cut corners or made mistakes. The inspectors generally give accounting firms two to three weeks' notice about the audits they intend to examine, according to people familiar with the matter. Because the accounting board sometimes inspects more than 60 annual audits performed by a Big Four firm, the board often will disclose them in batches of five to 10 so the auditors can gather records and fill out forms associated with the inspection. If an accounting firm found out which audits would be subject to inspection before it completed them, it could devote more time to those projects to ensure they pass muster with regulators, the people said. If it learned after an audit was issued, any last-minute changes to an audit or the work papers behind it would have to be documented under board rules. The news of the leak is ""pretty eye-opening,"" said Bryan Church, an accounting professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology. ""These guys feel enormous pressure dealing with inspectors, and they do stupid things."" Mr. Marcello had been KPMG's vice chairman of audit, the firm's top executive overseeing its U.S. audit practice, since 2015. Mr. Marcello also sat on the firm's management committee, which implements KPMG policies as decided by its board."
Wells Fargo,U.S. Commercial Property Loans Fall," Apr 12, 2017",31.93,0,"Commercial real-estate lending by banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions is declining as sales activity slows and regulators voice concern about the sector. Lenders closed roughly $491 billion of mortgage loans backed by U.S. property in 2016, down 3% from 2015, according to new statistics from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Most of the decline occurred in the fourth quarter, when volume was 7% lower than the 2015 quarter, according to Jamie Woodwell, the trade group's head of commercial-property research. Despite the decrease, the new-volume number was the third highest since the association began doing the survey, behind 2015 and the record year of 2007. The decline from 2015 to 2016 was due partly to a slowing of property sales, meaning fewer buyers needed financing. ""There's a very tight correlation"" between the two, Mr. Woodwell said. Buyers, for their part, are getting jittery because values have been rising for eight years and are near records. In all, investors purchased $493.7 billion of U.S. commercial property in 2016, down 10% from 2015, according to Real Capital Analytics. Activity has slowed further this year. Investors purchased just $50.3 billion worth of U.S. commercial property in the first two months of 2017, compared with $80.1 billion during the period in 2016, according to Real Capital Analytics. Regulators have been expressing concern about overheated commercial real-estate lending. At the end of 2016's third quarter there were 521 institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. with potentially worrisome concentrations of risk, according to an FDIC report this year. That is up from 474 institutions in the 2015 third quarter, the report said. Yet banks and insurers are getting more aggressive over deals as investment in the sector declines. New lenders also are emerging on the scene, including investment funds formed by private-equity firms that are focused on real-estate debt. ""It's tougher right now,"" said Craig Bender, who heads up ING Groep NV's U.S. real-estate lending business. ""The banks are hungry. The life-insurance companies are hungry."" Many bank executives view the commercial-property market as healthy, given rising rents and occupancies. Wells Fargo & Co., the country's largest commercial-property market lender, expects to lend about $30 billion this year, about the same as in 2016 and 2015, according to Mark Myers, the bank's head of commercial real estate. Those amounts are ""high-water marks"" for the bank, he said. Still, the bank recognizes that property values are at record levels after rising for eight years. ""I'd say, if I could look back one year ago, we're probably more cautious"" now, Mr. Myers said."
Wells Fargo,Retail Landlords Are Finding It Is Harder to Get a Loan," Apr 12, 2017",31.97,1,"The retail malaise hasn't stopped shopping-center landlords from getting loans -- it is just getting harder. With an oversupply of malls, changing consumer habits and increasing competition from e-commerce, property owners frequently have to spruce up their assets to make them trendier and draw more foot traffic. But the process of getting the financing for this reinvestment has gotten more complicated, said analysts, lenders and landlords. Lenders now grill landlords repeatedly about tenants' creditworthiness and exposure to competition from neighboring developments and e-commerce. On top of that, borrowers may have to pay higher interest rates than they are used to, as the perception of risk increases and the Federal Reserve boosts short-term interest rates. ""There is a sea change in attitudes over the last eight months,"" said Joseph Miller, co-founder of Runyon Group, a real-estate company with offices in Los Angeles and New York. ""Everyone is more cautious."" A broad swath of banks, private-equity funds and insurance companies ""have a risk-off approach and are more selective,"" he said. Loan terms have become more conservative. The average size of a retail real-estate loan was $8.3 million in 2016, down from $12.2 million in 2015, according to data from Real Capital Analytics. The average loan-to-value ratio fell to 66% in 2016 from 70% in 2015, while the average occupancy rate of the underlying properties rose to 98% in 2016 from 92% in 2015. A steady drumbeat of store closures is escalating concerns about the fate of retail shopping centers, especially lower-tier malls and strip centers. Major retailers such as Macy's Inc., Sears Holdings Corp. and J.C. Penney Co. have said in recent months they plan to close as many as 290 stores, while Payless Shoe Source Inc. last week filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and said it would close 400 stores. Real-estate executives and financiers said it is more difficult these days to value shopping centers amid the shift in shopping habits. ""Lenders are more forward-looking this time, and question what the property is going to look like five years from now,"" said Eric Wolf, managing director at Katz Properties LLC, a property investment, development and management firm. ""There is more face time with lenders, and you go over things, and go over again,"" said Mr. Wolf, whose firm owns 27 shopping centers in the U.S. Mall values can drop more sharply than residential and office properties if anchor tenants close and surrounding tenants then peter out. J.C. Penney and Macy's closed stores at Hudson Valley Mall in Kingston, N.Y., in 2015 and 2016, respectively, and the value of the mall plummeted 90%. The mall was valued at $87 million in 2010. Last December, Kroll Bond Rating Agency said it was valued at $8.1 million. Not all malls are struggling. Some better-quality properties in affluent coastal cities with a steady stream of tourists continue to boost rents. Larger mall operators still make hefty investments in their best properties to keep them competitive. Mr. Miller's Runyon Group recently secured a $47 million, 10-year securitized loan from Wells Fargo & Co. to refinance a mixed-use, open-air retail and office property in Los Angeles. ""Generally in two to three years, interest rates will be higher,"" said Mr. Miller. ""We're stress-testing our business plans to be successful in an environment like that."""
Wells Fargo,Did Banks Get a 'Trump Bump' or Not? --- Results to be released are a moment of truth for expectations set by the new presidency," Apr 12, 2017",32.21,1,"Investors get a first look at bank earnings under President Donald Trump this week. The biggest U.S. banks kick off the first-quarter earnings season Thursday morning with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co. and Citigroup Inc. each reporting results for the three months ended March 31. Investors will seek to judge whether the outlook for the firms will live up to the sharp rise in bank stocks since the election, reflecting expectations that growth will pick up under Trump administration policies. Most big banks are forecast to show higher profits compared with last year's dismal first quarter, when plunging oil prices, concerns about China's economy and tough trading conditions weighed on results. But over the past 90 days, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters have revised their revenue estimates lower for three banks -- Citigroup, J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. -- and raised them a bit for Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo. One reason for analysts' hesitancy is a surprising, sharp slowdown in business lending since late 2016. Commercial and industrial loans, which account for the bulk of many banks' loan portfolios, expanded by a 1% annual rate in January and shrank by a 1.3% annual rate in February, according to Federal Reserve data. That is a steep decline from the pace of expansion over much of the past year."
Wells Fargo,Equities -- Ahead of the Tape: Why Banks Stand to Regain Momentum," Apr 12, 2017",32,1,"The big postelection bank rally is over, but healthy first-quarter earnings and a good outlook for the rest of the year should give them another lift. Bank stocks were among the biggest winners late last year, with the KBW Nasdaq Bank index soaring 22% from Nov. 8 to the end of 2016. But since then the bank index has underperformed. Now, Wall Street will be watching closely as three of the biggest lenders in the U.S. -- J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo -- all report first-quarter earnings on Thursday. Analysts expect Wells Fargo, which benefits less than the others from elevated market activity and is still contending with the aftermath of its account-sales fiasco, to post a 3% year-over-year decline in earnings per share, according to FactSet. J.P. Morgan and Citigroup are both expected to report 13% increases in first-quarter earnings per share. This still represents a dialing down of expectations: As of the end of last year, analysts estimated first-quarter increases of 16% and 20%, respectively, for the two banks. A few developments have contributed to this tempering of analyst views: Long-term interest rates, which shot up following the election, have since come down a bit as markets are less sure that growth and inflation will accelerate. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasurys has fallen to 2.30% from 2.48% at the end of 2016. Loan growth has slowed significantly and mysteriously since November. Investors will be eager to hear what is causing this. Finally, market trading activity, which rose strongly in the second half of last year, has been relatively subdued. Still, these negatives are likely to be more than offset by several positive factors in the first quarter. For now, net interest margins are more sensitive to short-term than long-term rates, meaning banks will see real benefits from recent Federal Reserve tightening. Wells Fargo is still expensive at 1.6 times book value. But J.P. Morgan Chase looks fairly valued at 1.3 times, and Citigroup remains downright cheap at just 0.8 times. Bank shares have gotten off to a weak start this year. The rest of 2017 should give them a boost."
Wells Fargo,"Banking &amp; Finance -- Earnings: Three Banks: What You Need to Know --- J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup to issue results"," Apr 13, 2017",31.18,1,"J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. The expectation of loosening financial regulations has boosted J.P. Morgan's share price along with the sector since President Donald Trump was elected. But several figures who could affect bank regulation haven't been named and recent reports indicate Glass-Steagall could be back on the table, leading to possible bank breakups. At the bank's recent investor-day presentation in mid-February, executives said core loans should increase about 10% from a year earlier, so investors will be listening for any talk of an uptick in loan demand. CITIGROUP INC. Fixed-income trading is one of Citigroup's biggest businesses, and business has improved of late: A strong 2016 ended with a 36% surge in the fourth quarter. Continuing the hot streak would make it four quarters of trading gains in a row. Equities may be a tougher slog. Citigroup's investments in that business may help at the margin, but low stock-market volatility presents a tough backdrop for progress there. Citigroup has the most oversized capital cushion of any U.S. bank by many estimates, thanks in part to the capital it must hold against its large tax-loss assets. How quickly it uses those deferred taxes against profits will be closely watched, as that could herald bigger future buybacks and dividends. WELLS FARGO & CO.  Wells Fargo's board earlier this week released results of its monthslong independent investigation into the bank's sales practices. The group largely blamed former senior executives for the sales mess, including ex-Chief Executive John Stumpf, clawing back an additional $75 million in pay from two of them. Investors will be looking to see whether Wells Fargo now can turn from damage control back to growth. Two large proxy-advisory firms last week suggested Wells Fargo shareholders vote against several board directors for their lack of sufficient and timely oversight into the bank's sales practices. Investors will be eager to hear how management responds"
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp; Finance: Berkshire Likely to Back Wells," Apr 13, 2017",31.12,1,"Top Wells Fargo & Co. shareholder Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is likely to vote in support of the bank's directors in a potentially contentious shareholder meeting later this month, people familiar with the matter said. Warren Buffett, Berkshire's chairman and chief executive, has long been a supporter of the San Francisco bank and largely kept quiet as its sales-practices scandal erupted in the fall. Berkshire said Wednesday it plans to sell 9 million Wells Fargo shares to keep its ownership under 10%. The company said the sales aren't due to a change in its investment view. Berkshire didn't sell any Wells Fargo shares following the bank's sales-tactics scandal last fall. Mr. Buffett said in November that Wells Fargo's scandal was an ""egregious mistake"" but praised the bank's new chief executive, Timothy Sloan. It isn't known whether Berkshire has cast its votes, and it is still possible the company could decide to oppose certain Wells Fargo directors. The bank's annual shareholder meeting is April 25. A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment on the likely Berkshire vote. Earlier, the company said the bank appreciates ""the confidence that Berkshire Hathaway has placed in Wells Fargo over the years, both as our largest shareholder and a very valued customer."" Influential proxy-advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. last week recommended shareholders vote against 12 of 15 Wells Fargo directors. It didn't alter its stance after Wells Fargo's board released a report Monday that largely blamed two top executives who are no longer with the bank."

Wells Fargo,Yields Fall on 'Show-Me' Sentiment," Apr 14, 2017",29.74,1,"Government-bond yields are falling, the latest sign investors are retreating from expectations that favorable government policies would deliver a welcome jolt to global growth, inflation and interest rates. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell Thursday to 2.237%, its lowest close since Nov. 16. That was down from 2.294% Wednesday and 2.609% on March 13. Yields fall as bond prices rise. The decline is noteworthy because it takes the yield below the 2.3%-2.6% range that took hold soon after Donald Trump was elected president in November. U.S. markets are closed Friday for Good Friday. Many investors entered 2017 expecting the yield would rise to around 3% by year-end, reflecting economic growth and the administration's presumed success in cutting taxes and reducing regulation. Rising interest rates on bonds often reflect faster growth as investors demand better returns to compensate for higher short-term interest rates set by the Federal Reserve and inflation. Instead, yields are again falling from relatively low levels, raising fresh concerns about the health of the global economy years after the financial crisis and the present valuations of stocks, bonds and other assets. ""The Trump trade is fading as the complexities of implementing the Trump agenda have become gradually understood,"" said Christopher Sullivan, chief investment officer at United Nations Federal Credit Union. The bond rally isn't the only market development reflecting a shift in investors' thinking. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 have pulled back after hitting records in early March. Bank shares, a big postelection winner, have lagged behind this year, with the sector falling again Thursday despite generally solid earnings from Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. Shares of utilities, the laggard late last year, have rallied in 2017. The Mexican peso has almost recouped all of the ground it lost against the dollar after the U.S. election. Gold has regained a large part of its postelection selloff and is up 12% this year. The 10-year Treasury yield began to decline when Fed officials signaled after their March 14-15 policy meeting that they still expect to raise interest rates three times this year. That was a less aggressive message than many investors had expected and was followed by a setback for Mr. Trump when he failed to gather enough votes to pass a health-care bill. Tighter monetary policy tends to raise interest rates on new bonds, diminishing the value of outstanding debt that pays less. Faster growth can lead to higher inflation, which eats away at the value of bonds' fixed payments over time. Bonds got an extra boost this week from geopolitical developments, including rising tensions between the U.S. and Russia over the Syrian conflict and between the U.S. and North Korea amid efforts to thwart that country's nuclear development ambitions. Investors have also become increasingly concerned about France's presidential election, where two of the four leading candidates are deeply skeptical of the European Union. Then Mr. Trump on Wednesday said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that he favored a weaker dollar and low interest rates, pushing the 10-year yield as low as 2.218% in overnight trading. Some analysts have long been skeptical that the U.S. economy can accelerate significantly regardless of policy, as it continues to face headwinds including an aging population and low productivity growth. The GDPNow model from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta suggests the U.S. economy grew at a 0.6% rate in the first quarter. That is hardly the big lift in growth that investors anticipated after Mr. Trump's victory. Still, other economic models are more optimistic and many investors aren't too concerned about the overall economy. Even if growth has been modest, the labor market has been steadily tightening, leading to slowly rising wages that help to firm inflation figures."
Wells Fargo,Banks' Rate Boon Stays Out of Reach for Now," Apr 14, 2017",31.25,0,"Some of the nation's largest banks warned Thursday that the benefits investors anticipated from rising interest rates and the election of Donald Trump as president aren't panning out quite as quickly as many had hoped.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. posted sharp increases in first-quarter profit, fueled by a continued rebound in their Wall Street trading businesses. But the results, along with those from Wells Fargo & Co., highlighted that the rising interest rates, more robust loan demand and pro-growth policies that many bank investors were betting on after Mr. Trump's election had so far failed to yield breakout gains.Shares at all three banks fell more than the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which dropped 0.7%. Wells Fargo fell 3.3%, while J.P. Morgan lost 1.2%.Since the election, the S&P financial sector was up more than 16% heading into Thursday's trading, and less than 1% since inauguration.While bank stocks surged in the wake of Mr. Trump's surprise victory, they have slipped the past month as investors grow more doubtful about whether broad measures like lending growth and profitability will catch up with loftier valuations.Bank executives told investors on a series of conference calls that they were sanguine that U.S. policy makers' goals of loosening financial regulations and cutting tax rates would eventually help boost growth.""When you have a new president and they get going . . . it's going to be a sausage-making period,"" J.P. Morgan Chief Executive James Dimon said on a conference call with analysts. To expect it to be smooth, ""that would just be silly.""Investors are feeling less patient. ""There are itchy trigger fingers"" from investors looking to sell, said Christopher Davis, a veteran portfolio manager at Davis Funds, which manages about $25 billion in assets and recently reported owning large stakes of J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo.While he likes the steady and consistent growth both companies are likely to offer in coming years, he says that many investors in recent weeks have grown more worried about banks' lending potential.At both J.P. Morgan and Citigroup, profit rose 17% in the first quarter, with the capital-markets arms of each bank being the brightest spots of their reports. Wells Fargo, which has a relatively slimmer footprint on Wall Street businesses, said its first-quarter profit was flat.Commercial loan balances didn't change at J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. New auto loans declined 17% at J.P. Morgan and 29% at Wells Fargo compared with last year's first quarter. John Shrewsberry, Wells Fargo's finance chief, said that signs of rising delinquencies and deteriorating used-car values are causing the bank to be more cautious.In Citigroup's North American consumer-banking group, profit fell 25%, driven by credit losses on some credit cards. At J.P. Morgan's and Wells Fargo's consumer-banking arms, profit fell 20% and 9%, respectively.PNC Financial Services Group Inc. bucked some of the trends, saying stronger loan activity helped its earnings beat expectations Thursday. The Pittsburgh bank attributed the growth in part to markets where it is expanding, including Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis.In coming quarters, big banks hope that interest rates continue climbing, since that would essentially give them more pricing power in lending products.In March, the Federal Reserve moved its target short term rate higher, its third interest-rate bump in the past two years. Big banks earn more money by lending out their vast deposits when interest rates rise. They also benefit from a larger gap between short term and long term rates, a so-called steep yield curve.J.P. Morgan said it expects net interest income to rise by about $4.5 billion in 2017. Citigroup said it was now building into future plans an additional rate increase, in June. That would help bump up its expected year-over-year core interest revenue by $1.5 billion over the next three quarters.But the bank also made a ""modest reduction"" in expectations for loan growth. Rising rates have a downside in making some loans, especially mortgage refinancing, less attractive to borrowers.Wall Street trading desks were a bright spot. J.P. Morgan's trading revenue increased 13% to $5.82 billion in the first quarter of 2017, while Citigroup's rose 17% to $4.39 billion. Last year's first quarter was a brutal one for each bank's trading arm, so the latest results are coming off of a low base.Fixed-income trading revenue was up nearly 20% at each bank, reflecting higher activity in markets for government bonds and other securities closely tied to interest rates. Investment-banking fees at each bank were up nearly 40% thanks in part to underwriting more bond deals for companies looking to lock in low borrowing costs.""There's good momentum, as we see things now,"" said Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat. ""Client engagement was high, and I think remains high into the second quarter.""Meanwhile, Marianne Lake, J.P. Morgan's finance chief, said on a conference call that she expected the Trump administration's agenda would eventually lead to more hiring, spending and borrowing. But she acknowledged that much of the economic activity hadn't yet arrived. ""It's completely understandable that optimism would lead action."""
Wells Fargo,Banks' Pain Is Spread Unevenly," Apr 14, 2017",31.2,0,"The split between solid performance on Wall Street and a slowdown in lending growth is turning some banks into winners and others into laggards. First-quarter net income rose by 17% from a year earlier at both J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup, beating analyst estimates in both cases, thanks to strong investment banking and trading activity. Wells Fargo saw flat net profit as loan growth slowed and expenses swelled in the aftermath of its sales-practice scandal. The banks gave more details around a sudden slowdown in loan growth that has been showing up in Federal Reserve data and has caused concern and confusion among economists. At J.P. Morgan, total loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter rose 6% from a year earlier, a slight deceleration from 7% growth at the end of last year. In the first quarter of 2016, J.P. Morgan's overall loan growth was a much stronger 11%. The company also said that average commercial and industrial loans in the quarter increased 8% from a year earlier, though Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said this still represents a deceleration. At Citigroup, loans grew by 8% from a year earlier in its global consumer operations and by 3% at its corporate bank. One explanation for weakening loan growth could be that companies are raising money in capital markets instead of borrowing from banks. Ms. Lake said capital markets were ""wide open."" She also said there were fewer big, debt-financed M&A deals in the first quarter, which could have contributed some ""noise"" to the Fed's data. J.P. Morgan Chief Executive James Dimon cited other factors as well for the slowdown, including higher mortgage rates and slowing auto sales. But he told analysts not to overreact and expressed confidence in the overall economic picture in the U.S. Wells Fargo, which acts more like a regional bank because it lacks a big investment-banking operation, said the slowdown is an industry trend. The bank said growth of average quarterly loans slowed to 4% in the first quarter from 6% in the fourth quarter. The company cited a number of factors, including declining mortgages and the bank's own tightening of standards in auto loans. Costs are still rising as the company tries to dig its way out of the sales-scandal mess. Citigroup and J.P. Morgan both got big boosts from equity and debt underwriting. Wells Fargo was the loser of the day, and it is also the most expensive of the three, trading at 1.5 times book value. The outlook for banking shares overall remains positive, but there is no compelling reason to hold this one."
Wells Fargo,"Investors Rethinking Risk --- Rising unease fuels market turnaround after soft economic data, global conflicts"," Apr 15, 2017",30.26,0,"Signs of a slowdown in the U.S. economy and rising anxiety in markets are prompting many investors to reassess their portfolios and prune risky positions. On Friday, the consumer-price index, which measures what Americans pay for goods and services, declined. It was the first monthly decline for core prices, which exclude the often-volatile categories of food and energy, since January 2010. The data came a week after the Labor Department said U.S. employers added far fewer jobs in March than economists had expected. The declines, which helped push the WSJ Dollar Index to its fourth retreat in five sessions, amplify the concern among many investors that markets are entering a treacherous period as lackluster economic fundamentals collide with unpredictable domestic and international politics. The S&P 500 is down about 3% from its record hit in March, within the range many analysts have said they expect the stock market to end 2017. The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, climbed every trading day this past week, rising 24% since April 7 to its highest since November. Bond yields have fallen to their lowest level since just after the November elections, reflecting the retreat of expectations that a White House policy onslaught would spearhead a rise in economic growth and inflation. In recent weeks, Erik Knutzen, multiasset class chief investment officer at Neuberger Berman, said he reduced exposure to large-company stocks and instead put that money into European and emerging-market stocks in some of the portfolios he manages, citing more-favorable valuations overseas. ""We were concerned a lot of optimism and good news was already priced in, and we wanted to take some chips off the table,"" he said. ""We do expect an increase in volatility, but we're not expecting a 20% drawdown in markets."" Potential pitfalls for markets are numerous. President Donald Trump this past week reversed several positions that had defined his campaign. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, he said he supported the Export-Import Bank and declined to label China as a currency manipulator. At a news conference Wednesday, he said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is no longer obsolete, as he said repeatedly during the campaign. On Thursday, after the Pentagon said the U.S. dropped one of its largest nonnuclear bombs on Afghanistan, U.S. stocks fell further. The perception of policy volatility is among the reasons that some investors are increasing holdings of cash, at least for the near term. ""The realization is it's going to be bumpy the next six, nine or 12 months,"" said Mr. Knutzen. Bond investors have scored gains amid the turmoil. Over the past four trading days, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note registered its largest one-week decline since last June, settling Thursday at 2.237%, its lowest close since Nov. 16. Yields fall when bond prices rise. Over the past month, one development after another has led investors to rethink assumptions that had previously caused them to sell bonds. Against this backdrop, one argument for higher yields that has remained intact has been a trend toward higher U.S. inflation. But that also suffered a setback Friday with the release of the CPI report. While many bond investors had already started to scale back bets on inflation, the report confirmed suspicions ""that inflation is not as big of an issue as we thought it was,"" said George Rusnak, co-head of global fixed-income strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. One area where U.S. investors might shift money to protect their portfolios: Europe. Demand for European stocks has risen this year thanks to relatively low valuations, data pointing to an improving eurozone economy and polls suggesting far-right candidate Marine Le Pen's odds of winning the French presidential elections have moderated. Investors poured $1.8 billion into European equity funds in the week through Wednesday, according to data from EPFR Global, the biggest inflows for those funds in 68 weeks. Meanwhile, investors put just $400 million into U.S. equity funds. The prior week, they had withdrawn $14.5 billion, the largest outflow for U.S. equities in 82 weeks. The moves mark a reversal from the period between Election Day and year-end, when bets that the Trump administration's agenda would supercharge economic growth in the U.S. led investors to pour $57.7 billion into U.S. equity funds while withdrawing $1.1 billion from their European counterparts, according to EPFR data. While the VIX remains well below its 10-year average, its revival has marked a sharp move relative to the S&P 500 index, which fell about 1% since April 7. The VIX is based on options prices on the S&P 500 index and tends to rise when stocks fall. Investors also drove up the price of April futures contracts on the VIX relative to May expiration contracts, signaling anxiety around the near term. ""There's some nervousness in the marketplace that's not reflected in the S&P 500 index,"" John-Mark Piampiano, head of equity derivatives strategy at Seaport Global Securities, said. Gunjan Banerji and Akane Otani contributed to this article."

Wells Fargo,Key Vote Tests Wells Fargo's Directors," Apr 17, 2017",32.5,0,"Wells Fargo & Co. faces something few other big banks have dealt with since the financial crisis:a serious effort to vote out most of its directors. As the bank's April 25 annual shareholder meeting approaches, bank executives and directors are scrambling to meet with key investors and deal with the possibility that they could see one or more fail to win re-election, people familiar with the process said. ""A number of those directors will be vulnerable,"" an official at one large Wells Fargo investor said this past week. It is rare for shareholders to vote a director off a big company's board. In the past five years, just nine directors have left boards of companies in the S&P 500 after they failed to receive majority support, according to ISS Analytics, the proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.'s data arm. The top Wells Fargo official at risk: Chairman Stephen Sanger, who took over last October when the former Wells Fargo chairman and chief executive officer, John Stumpf, resigned after a sales-practices scandal resulted in a $185 million settlement and two congressional grillings. Mr. Sanger, the former chief of General Mills Inc., has handled the board's response to the sales problems, culminating in a 113-page report April 10 that largely blamed Mr. Stumpf and one of his key lieutenants, who has also left the bank. Though Wells Fargo typically reaches out to investors around this time, shareholders have responded with many questions about the board's role, especially after the investigation results. For instance, some want to know why the board didn't act sooner to shake up the retail-banking unit despite concerns in 2014 and 2015 about improper employee practices that included signing customers up for fake accounts to meet sales goals. ""The fraud at Wells Fargo is ultimately an oversight failure. That's why accountability -- and real, meaningful change -- needs to start at the top,"" said New York City Comptroller Scott M. Stringer. ""The only question is which directors, and that is what investors are now assessing."" As of Dec. 30, the city's pension funds had about $594 million in Wells Fargo stock. Earlier this month, the influential firm ISS recommended shareholders vote against Mr. Sanger and 11 of his colleagues on Wells Fargo's 15-member board. The second-largest proxy advisory firm, Glass Lewis & Co., recommended investors vote for Mr. Sanger, but against six directors. Seeing so many directors lose re-election froma major corporate board without any replacements in store would be unusual, raising potentially serious issues for Wells Fargo and its current CEO, Timothy Sloan. Mr. Sloan has so far avoided shouldering much of the blame for the sales problems because they occurred in the retail consumer business, which he didn't oversee. Mr. Sloan said in an interview that he recently spoke with Warren Buffett, head of Wells Fargo's largest shareholder, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., who expressed his support for management and the board. ""We value his input and engagement. . .at a very important time for the company,"" Mr. Sloan said. Messrs. Sloan and Sanger and other Wells Fargo officials are to meet or talk with more than 20 of the largest Wells Fargo investors this week, people involved with the meetings said. Management and board members plan to argue that the board has taken the fallout from the scandal seriously, clawing back $183 million in pay from current and former executives.The board has also overhauled four of its committees -- risk, audit, human resources and corporate responsibility -- to further strengthen their oversight of the company. Wells Fargo Directors that Received 'No' Votes from both Institutional Shareholder Services John D. Baker II, member corporate responsibility committee John S.

Wells Fargo,Notable &amp; Quotable: Divesting From Everything," Apr 18, 2017",109.6,1,"Mike Ludwig reporting at Truth-out.org, April 11: In a sweeping move that follows a wave of divestment activism in Portland, Oregon, and across the country, the Portland City Council voted last week to pull all of the city's investments in corporate bonds and securities. The decision was a major victory for a broad coalition of activists who have pushed for the city to end its investments in corporations that have questionable records on the environment and human rights, including ties to the Dakota Access pipeline, the private prison industry and the Israeli occupation of Palestine. ""As their decision stands now, it's permanent. . . . We can rest assured in Portland that our money won't be funding prisons, pipelines and the occupation of Palestine,"" said Amanda Aguilar Shank, an organizer with the racial justice group Enlace, in an interview with Truthout. Portland's City Council had originally considered adding Caterpillar, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase and six other companies identified by a volunteer committee on socially responsible investing to a so-called ""Do Not Buy"" list, but the council was unable to come to an agreement on which companies to blacklist from the city's investment portfolio. Instead, in December, they voted to place a temporary halt on all new corporate investments until permanent decisions could be made. After activists organized rallies and packed council meetings with hours of testimony, the council agreed last week to end corporate investments altogether."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp; Finance -- Tuesday's Results: What to Watch," Apr 18, 2017",109.95,0,"BANK OF AMERICARising Rates: Bank of America is expected to benefit more than its peers from higher interest rates. The quarter's results will reveal how the actual lift from higher rates -- which banks have anticipated for years -- stacks up against the bank's own expectations. The lender has said it expects net interest income to increase about $600 million from the fourth quarter. Loan Growth: Keep an eye on how much the industrywide slowdown in loan growth affects the bank. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. reported declines in lending growth in their first-quarter earnings reports last week and other metrics have signaled a marked slowdown in business-related lending. Slowing loan growth could detract from the benefit that banks get from higher rates. D.C. Commentary: Bank of America shares have risen 31% from the election through last week partially on hopes that the Trump administration will give banks regulatory relief and tax reform. Watch to see if CEO Brian Moynihan weighs in on what J.P. Morgan CEO James Dimon last week called the ""sausage-making period"" of a president's first months or reports that a new Federal Reserve official overseeing banks could be named soon.

U.S. takeovers completed in the quarter fell 10% from a year ago, the lowest by dollar value since 2013, according to FactSet. A $450 Million Boost: Goldman is expecting a lift to earnings of up to $450 million from a new accounting rule that affects the tax benefits it gets when employees exercise stock options.

Wells Fargo,Banking &amp; Finance: M&amp;T Bank Results Top Estimates," Apr 18, 2017",114.74,1,"M&T Bank Corp. led financial shares higher after reporting earnings that beat expectations, helped by the recent uptick in interest rates. The Buffalo, N.Y., bank also reported increased lending from a year ago, though its chief financial officer cautioned against assuming that loan demand would continue at the same speed. ""Loan growth, despite the optimism for change and a more business-friendly administration, has yet to materialize in a meaningful way,"" Chief Financial Officer Darren King said in a call with analysts on Monday. Still, the bank's shares rose 3.9%, well ahead of the 1.9% gain in the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index. Donald Trump's surprise win in the presidential election in November sent bank stocks higher. But analysts and investors have wondered whether the stock market gains will translate into loan demand. At M&T, run by Chairman and CEO Robert Wilmers, both commercial and consumer lending were up from the first quarter in 2016. Mr. King said there is ""still reason for optimism,"" but he added that the bank's outlook for 2017 loan growth is ""a little lower than it was in January."" The regional bank's results were similar to those of PNC Financial Services Group Inc., which reported earnings last week that beat expectations. PNC and M&T are among the first regional lenders to disclose first-quarter earnings, setting the tone for the rest of the banks. Regions Financial Corp. is slated to report Tuesday. At larger banks that have reported earnings, including Wells Fargo & Co. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the lending picture has been more mixed, though trading helped the bottom line at both J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc. M&T posted earnings per share of $2.12, above the $1.93 analysts expected. Net interest margin, a key measure of lending profitability, and net interest income both rose, in part due to a rise in short-term interest rates. Net interest margin rose to 3.34% from 3.18% a year earlier and from 3.08% in the December quarter. This drove an increase of taxable equivalent net interest income to $922 million from $878 million a year earlier. The Federal Reserve raised its target short-term rate in both December and March, welcome news to banks that have been crimped from charging higher rates on loans. Still, Mr. King noted that higher rates have at least one disadvantage for banks: They challenge mortgage banking, where consumers are influenced to buy when rates are low. Consumer real-estate loans were down."
Wells Fargo,Banks Face a Risk From Increasing Consumer Borrowing," Apr 18, 2017",114.64,0,"Consumers have been ramping up debt in the U.S., adding a potential new risk to banks and a weight on the economy. Since the financial crisis, mortgage lending has been hogtied with new regulations that make it more difficult, especially for young or subprime borrowers, to get home loans. But other forms of consumer credit, including auto, student and credit card loans, have been growing strongly in recent years, helping boost retail spending, a major driver of economic growth. Last week, data from the Federal Reserve showed that balances have now topped $1 trillion for all three of these consumer debt categories. Credit cards breached that threshold in February, joining auto and student loans above that level. Credit-card debt rose to the highest level since January 2009. Indeed, as corporate lending has recently slowed, credit-card lending has become one of the top drivers of loan growth for major banks. On Thursday, J.P. Morgan Chase said credit-card loans were up 7.1% from a year earlier at the end of the first quarter, compared with 6% loan growth overall. Citigroup said credit-card loans were up 15% from a year earlier, powered by its acquisition last year of the Costco credit card portfolio from American Express. Problems with loans showed up in major banks' earnings reports. J.P. Morgan took a $470 million write-down on its student-loan book and marked the portfolio as available for sale. It also cited higher depreciation in auto leases as one factor driving a 5% rise in expenses at its consumer banking unit. Wells Fargo, which also reported earnings on Thursday, said it has been tightening standards on auto loans, which contributed to an overall loan growth slowdown at the bank. Auto loans have been showing signs of trouble recently, and while most of the riskiest aren't made by banks, the impact is being felt in slowing car sales. At Wells Fargo, net charge-offs have been ticking up but remained relatively low at 1.1% of total auto loans in the first quarter. Meanwhile, credit-card defaults are rising at all three lenders and, though they are still at very low levels relative to history, are expected to rise further. The bigger issue is whether consumers, who have gotten more serious about saving, get worried about their debt levels and scale back spending. Friday's weak retail sales data back up that idea. A record low number of Americans have said they would spend their tax refunds this year and about half said they would put the cash into savings, according to the National Retail Federation. Bank investors, who haven't focused on consumer credit risks in recent years, should start paying attention. The more immediate risk is a slowdown in consumer spending, which will hurt more than just lenders"
Wells Fargo,"Wall Street's Fee Bonanza --- Retirement rule is in limbo, but firms still shift away from commission model"," Apr 19, 2017",114.53,0,"An Obama-era retirement-savings rule is in limbo, but investors already are pouring their retirement savings into brokerages' promise of conflict-free financial advice in exchange for a fee. Bank of America Corp.'s global wealth unit, which includes the ""thundering herd"" brokerage force of Merrill Lynch, gained a record $29.2 billion in new fee-based assets in the first quarter, the bank said Tuesday. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. said last week that $8 billion of new assets flowed into long-term products, including those that charge a recurring fee. Also on Tuesday, private-equity firms Stone Point Capital LLC and KKR & Co. agreed to acquire a majority stake in Focus Financial Partners, a New York-based investment firm that backs independent financial advisers who charge fees and pledge to minimize conflicts, in a $2 billion deal. The developments are the latest sign that advice for a recurring fee is Wall Street's go-to compensation model for the future, as firms like Merrill and J.P. Morgan use the fiduciary rule as a way to phase out commissions as a payment option in retirement accounts. The industry shift is coming even as the Trump administration seeks to eliminate or revise the rule. ""They were already in this mode"" of shifting toward fees, said Denise Valentine, a senior analyst on wealth management at Aite Group. ""The rule just allowed them to put this into the marketplace and make a commitment."" Even before the fiduciary rule, brokerages had been trying to abandon their sales-driven cultures to position their broker forces more like independent financial advisers who create financial plans and offer advice. Besides positioning themselves to better compete with the rise of smaller, independent rivals and investors' growing preference for passive investments, brokerage executives found that fees for advice and services could be more lucrative over the longer term compared with commissions. Researcher Morningstar Inc. says fee-based accounts can yield as much as 50% more revenue than commission accounts. The shift to fees from commissions has picked up as firms sought to comply with the Labor Department's fiduciary rule. Besides the wider margin on such accounts, fees also minimize potential conflicts tied to the sale of specific investment products and cut down on some of the litigation risk brought on by the rule, observers said. However, such accounts can also lead to higher fees for investors who trade little. Bank of America has been at the fore of the charge. It set a course that sought to mostly do away with commissions in retirement accounts in favor of recurring fees and has been heavily advertising its shift. Merrill, for its part, decided that clients who wanted retirement advice from one of its brokers would have to pay a fee to avoid the rule's more onerous requirements and heightened legal risk. That shift to fees is already boosting its bottom line. Higher revenue tied to fee-based assets helped push Merrill's revenue up 3% from last year to $3.8 billion in the first quarter and offset declines in traditional commission revenue, the bank said. Of Bank of America's $2.6 trillion in total wealth assets, about $946.8 billion are in longer-term investment strategies, including those that charge a fee. ""These solid results were produced in a period of change for the industry as firms and clients anticipate new fiduciary standards and other market dynamics, such as the shift between active and passive investing,"" Bank of America's finance chief, Paul Donofrio, said on a conference call Tuesday. Even after the Labor Department said earlier this month that it would delay the rule's April 10 implementation by 60 days to conduct a review of its economic impact, Merrill executives told brokers to push forward. J.P. Morgan said it would continue with its plan to steer its commission-paying clients to accounts that charge a fee or a self-directed option but would push back its deadlines for clients to convert to coincide with the rule's new timeline. Rivals such as Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co. have said they would continue to allow retirement savers to pay commissions in retirement accounts, although they would likely face some sales restrictions. Still, those banks have continued to report gains in fee-based assets in recent years. Bank of America's first-quarter fee-based inflows were a record high for the wealth unit, which includes Merrill and private bank U.S. Trust, beating the previous mark of $20.4 billion set in the first quarter of 2013. The bank said the inflows were driven by ""strong"" client activity and the movement of assets from individual retirement accounts that pay commissions into fee-based accounts. The industry's transformation comes as the U.S.'s biggest brokerages attempt to stop losing market share to independent financial advisers much like the ones who work with Focus Financial. Traditional brokerages' share of the advice market has shrunk from 63% of assets in 2010 to 59% in 2015, while independent advisers have grown from 37% to nearly 41%, according to researcher Cerulli Associates. How Firms Tackle Retirement Rules The Labor Department's decision to push back retirement rules by 60 days has left many individual investors wondering what this means for their brokerage accounts. The rule would have required brokers who oversee $3 trillion in tax-advantaged retirement savings to act in their clients' best interest. With the rule now set to take effect on June 9, brokerages have either chosen to move ahead or modify their plans. Here are some of the plans: Bank of America Corp.-owned brokerage Merrill Lynch is continuing with its decision to move most retirement savers who pay a commission to accounts that charge a fee based on a percentage of assets. Morgan Stanley planned to offer both fee- and commission-based individual retirement accounts, although the latter wouldn't offer investors access to certain investment products immediately. Wells Fargo & Co. planned to make changes to its commission-based IRA product so it complied with the rule. LPL Financial Holdings Inc. introduced new commission-based products and lowered investment minimums on some advisory products.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency published the results of an internal review that found OCC supervisors missed or failed to address warning signs about the bank's risky sales-incentive program. The bank examiners knew of reports of sales-integrity violations as far back as 2010 but ""did not take timely and effective supervisory actions,"" the report said. The bank paid a $185 million fine in September 2016 for what authorities called widespread illegal sales practices that led to the opening of as many as two million phony customer accounts. Many employees were fired or quit as a result of a cutthroat sales culture, and customers were stuck with credit cards or other products they didn't seek. The OCC report amounts to a detailed critique of failures at the agency, the primary regulator of Wells Fargo. It found that supervisors were aware of complaints about the sales program, including a meeting with a senior Wells Fargo executive in January 2010 where they inquired about 700 whistleblower complaints ""related to the gaming of incentive plans."" Examiners in 2010 also pointed out that they hadn't seen the bank assess risks associated with the sales practices or create a good system for monitoring complaints about them, the report said. Ryan Tracy ENERGY Crude Falls on Rise In Gasoline Stockpile Crude prices had their worst day in over a month after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported an unexpected increase in gasoline supplies. The 1.5-million-barrel increase in gasoline stockpiles raised fears that a gasoline glut would cause refiners to cut their purchases of crude. U.S. crude futures fell $1.97, or 3.8%, to $50.44 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent, the global benchmark, fell $1.96, or 3.6%, to $52.93 a barrel. It was the biggest tumble for both benchmarks since March 8, when oil prices sold off sharply after weekly EIA data showed an unexpected increase in crude supplies. This time the data showed that crude-oil inventories fell last week, but the 1-million-barrel decline wasn't big enough to assuage concerns about rising gasoline supplies and a 17,000-barrel-a-day increase in U.S. oil production. Output from U.S. oil fields has been steadily rising -- something that could stand in the way of efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to bring supply and demand into balance."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp; Markets: Big Holders Target Wells," Apr 22, 2017",115.24,1,"A number of public pension funds have come out against directors on Wells Fargo & Co.'s board, just days ahead of the what is shaping up to be a contentious annual shareholder meeting for the embattled bank. New York City's Office of the Comptroller, which oversees pension funds that own about 11.5 million shares or about 0.23% of Wells Fargo shares outstanding, said it would oppose reelection of 10 out of 15 of the San Francisco bank's directors. That includes the bank's nonexecutive chairman, Stephen Sanger, plus all but two members of the board's risk, audit and human-resources committees. Additionally, California State Teachers' Retirement System, or Calstrs, said it voted its 11.6 million shares against nine board members, including Mr. Sanger. The other large public-pension system in California, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers, is voting its 13.9 million shares similarly, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Friday evening. Together, the two largest public pension systems in California hold about 0.5% of Wells Fargo's shares outstanding. ""These board members bear responsibility for the failure of oversight of sales practices at Wells Fargo,"" a spokesman for Calstrs said. Wells Fargo's shareholders meeting is scheduled for Tuesday and directors face a tough election battle following the bank's sales-practices scandal last fall. The bank agreed to a $185 million settlement over employees opening as many as 2.1 million accounts without customers' knowledge. Earlier this month, influential proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. recommended shareholders vote against Mr. Sanger and 11 of his colleagues on Wells Fargo's 15-member board. The second-largest proxy advisory firm, Glass Lewis & Co., recommended investors vote for Mr. Sanger but against six directors. A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment on individual shareholders.

Wells Fargo,Business News: Wells Board Faces Unclear Prospects," Apr 24, 2017",116.25,1,"The battle over Wells Fargo & Co.'s board is going down to the last possible moment, with uncertainty hanging over the re-election prospects of several directors at Tuesday's annual shareholder meeting, according to people familiar with the matter. Some large institutional shareholders have yet to weigh in and are expected to place their votes Monday, just ahead of the conclave. But as of Sunday, votes already placed had left several directors at risk of losing re-election, the people familiar with the matter said. Nonexecutive Chairman Stephen Sanger isn't among those directors, but Enrique Hernandez, head of the bank's board risk committee, is vulnerable, one of the people said. While it is unclear whether any directors will be voted out, the bank needs decisive victories -- especially because directors are running unopposed. If directors get less than 80% of the vote for re-election, it would send a clear message to the San Francisco bank that shareholders are seeking bigger changes after its sales-practices scandal, said Charles Elson, director of the University of Delaware's John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance. And shareholders, in meetings with the bank in recent weeks, already have been sending the message that more needs to be done to address systemic problems at the bank, according to people familiar with the meetings. Employees over a five-year period opened as many as 2.1 million accounts using fictitious or unauthorized customer information, leading to a $185 million settlement with regulators last fall. A $142 million settlement over customer class-action lawsuits is also pending. The bank has said it is cooperating with state and federal investigations into the sales-practices scandal. In an interview last Wednesday, Chief Executive Timothy Sloan said he doesn't think the bank needs to make any changes to its board risk committee, which comprises chairs from its other board committees. He also said a recent report from the bank's board about the scandal showed that Mr. Hernandez had raised questions with management about aggressive sales tactics. The independent board report largely placed blame on two executives who are no longer with the bank. The bank named two new directors to the board earlier this year. Some institutional investors briefed by Wells Fargo executives and directors said the bank tried to reassure them that the board's makeup will change in coming years because of mandatory retirements. Some investors said they were told that six members will hit the maximum age of 72 and will leave over the next four years. While bank officials also made no promises to rotate committee memberships or chairmen, an official from an institutional shareholder said ""there needs to be a thoughtful but accelerated response to constitute a new board."" Meanwhile, proxy-advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. has recommended that shareholders vote against Mr. Sanger and 11 of his colleagues on Wells Fargo's 15-member board."
Wells Fargo,"The Future of Finance (A Special Report) --- Personal Banking Becomes Even More Personal: Financial institutions know a lot about their customers, and they are eager to make more use of that knowledge"," Apr 25, 2017",117.66,0,"Banks know more about their customers than ever, and increasingly are trying to get more use out of that information. The results can be convenient, or just creepy. Banks can look at customers' debit-card and credit-card transactions, online-bill payments and account activity to see what they're buying, who they're working for and other information. Now, from the largest Wall Street behemoths to small community lenders, the banks are looking to use that data in new ways, investing in more-advanced technology to better target prospective customers and sell more services to existing ones. Such moves have been a long time coming in an industry not known for embracing technological change. But banks are under increasing pressure from well-funded startups that make snap lending decisions based on such unorthodox metrics as a customer's online-shopping record. Developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning are giving the banks more firepower to spot patterns in financial or personal issues a consumer might be having. Online bill payments, call-center interactions and online chats with customer-service representatives have given the banks more data to play with than ever before. But access by banks to so much personal information raises concerns about privacy and consumers' rights in this era of big data and the Internet of Everything. Richard Cordray, head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said at a recent industry conference that banks need to be careful about how they use and store customer data. ""We see the market moving quickly, with high stakes for all involved,"" Mr. Cordray says. New rules regarding data privacy are also on the way in Europe. Some big players are already being careful as a result of what they know. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. is using customer data to determine when not to bug its customers. For instance, the bank doesn't want to pitch a new credit card to a customer who has recently been the victim of card-related fraud. Generally speaking, though, banks, including Chase, know they are sitting on a large deposit of gold -- and they intend to mine it. Chase, the largest U.S. bank by assets, tailors offers based on what it knows about customers' wealth, family size and recent spending and borrowing patterns, bank executives say. ""The last thing we want to do is sell somebody a product they don't want, or don't qualify for,"" says Kristin Lemkau, chief marketing officer at Chase. ""We want to strengthen the relationship, not cheapen"" it. That means connecting the dots in ways customers feel comfortable with. ""If someone is buying a lot of things at the home-improvement store. . .maybe we should call them up and ask if they need a home-equity line, versus the old days, where everyone who walked into the branch, we would say, 'Hey, do you need a home-equity line?' "" says Bob Hedges, a partner at consulting firm A.T. Kearney. Fifth Third Bancorp plans to experiment with cellphone location technology that will allow the bank to send customers a text message when they are close to a branch and encourage them to stop by. Melissa Stevens, Fifth Third's chief digital officer, says her bank will move cautiously. ""There's that balance,"" she says. ""You want to show that you're utilizing and embracing new technologies, but you also don't want to freak people out and accidentally alienate customers."" Contacts that make consumers look over their shoulders may still be welcome as long as the messages are appropriate or useful, bankers say. Rob Lee, chief product officer for banking and payments at financial-technology company FIS, says his company is helping banks with just-in-time marketing. If a bank notices a customer eating lunch at different college campuses all week, it might send offers or news about student loans, he says. Or customers who keep spending money on car repairs might be receptive to messages about how to qualify for a car loan. Other pressures, besides competition from startups, are pushing banks to mine their data for more opportunities. For decades, they were more interested in buying other banks to become bigger, then integrating the target bank's technology to cut costs. The financial crisis largely put an end to such deals; now banks are looking inward to their relationships with customers. When Wells Fargo & Co. customers have their paycheck deposited by a different employer, these days they might get asked if they need help switching their 401(k) over from the previous employer, says Charles Thomas, the bank's chief data officer. A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, which in September settled with regulators over charges that it opened accounts using fictitious or unauthorized customer information, says that data is helping it prevent fraud, process speedier transactions and make basic recommendations. The bank also hopes to use newer tools including artificial intelligence to do things like send customers text alerts about unusual transactions or offer virtual financial advisers. At Citigroup Inc., the bank knows when customers have redeemed credit-card points for travel rewards, and in response it highlights travel options like flights and hotels when reminding those customers to redeem more points. Some banks are hiring data-analytics firms to help them find out more about their customers, using data they already have. When First Financial Bancorp, a community lender based in Cincinnati, discovered that many of its customers weren't tapping the home-equity lines of credit they opened at the bank, it asked Segmint Inc., a data-driven marketing firm based in Akron, Ohio, to analyze those customers' credit-card transactions, online bill payments and other information. Then it started targeting those customers with messages based on what it thought would interest them. To some the bank sent messages noting that the money from a home-equity line would be a great way to help with home repairs. To others, it encouraged using the money to travel. The project so far has increased the usage rate on the home-equity loans, says Lynda Crossan, vice president of marketing. Not every profitable use of customer data requires an analytical or technological approach. In 2014, Wells Fargo started sending birthday notes to customers via its mobile app. The following year, tellers in branches started offering birthday wishes as well. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman says customers ""love the personal touch."""
Wells Fargo,'Living Will' for Wells Cleared by Regulators," Apr 25, 2017",118.04,1,"Wells Fargo & Co., girding for a contentious shareholders meeting, got some unexpected good news on another front: Regulators signed off on its attempt to fix a blueprint for avoiding a bailout should the bank ever founder. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Federal Reserve on Monday said Wells Fargo passed its ""living will"" for 2015. The regulators had failed the bank early last year and dinged it a second time in December, essentially meaning Wells Fargo had failed a make-up test. A Wells Fargo spokesman didn't have an immediate comment. Resolution plans, known as living wills, are a requirement of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, which sought to prevent bailouts partly by forcing big banks to develop a plan for how they could go through bankruptcy without taxpayer assistance. The law directed regulators to judge whether plans are credible and gave them power to sanction, or even break up, firms that are found lacking. Wells Fargo's December submission marked the first time the Fed and FDIC imposed penalties on a bank under the process, barring Wells Fargo at the time from creating new international banking units or acquiring any nonbank subsidiaries. There would have been additional sanctions if the bank didn't pass its most recent resubmission, such as capping growth or forcing it to divest itself of certain assets or businesses."

Wells Fargo,The Shattered Arguments for a New Glass-Steagall," Apr 26, 2017",114.73,1,"Gary Cohn may not be the first White House official you'd expect to favor reinstating Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that split commercial banks from investment banks. Yet Mr. Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs president who now leads the National Economic Council, urged just that in a private meeting with lawmakers, according to Bloomberg News. This is deeply disappointing, particularly coming from an administration that seeks to stimulate growth by removing the government shackles that suppress competition and burden markets.The 1999 repeal of Glass-Steagall was unfairly blamed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Some people -- apparently Mr. Cohn among them -- mistakenly believe that investment banking is so risky that it should be once again kept separate from commercial banking. The truth is exactly the opposite: Traditional investment banking entails very little risk. The danger is stand-alone investment banks that are not diversified enough to survive a shock.Traditional investment banks primarily underwrite debt and equity for corporations; provide advice on mergers, acquisitions and divestitures; buy and sell securities for institutions; and help clients hedge their risks. These activities involve almost no risk on the investment banks' own books. In contrast, commercial banks extend credit to people and businesses and retain a good deal of both the credit risk and the interest-rate risk. The repeal of Glass-Steagall allowed these banks to diversify their risks and revenues by providing fee-based investment services.Banks are at risk of failure when they become too concentrated by geography, industry or product line. Risk needs to be diversified so that no one mistake can bring down the entire institution. Even firms like Citigroup and Bank of America that made a series of mistakes in the 2008 crisis survived because they were diversified. Investment banks that were not properly diversified did not survive: Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch.The major perpetrators of the 2008 financial crisis were 20 or so institutions that had originated, securitized and distributed exotic subprime mortgages with toxic features. About 10 investment banks packaged mortgages made by savings-and-loan associations such as Countrywide, Washington Mutual and Indy Mac, and by state-chartered mortgage brokers -- many of which committed outright fraud. These S&Ls were the remnants of an industry that had cost taxpayers some $150 billion during the 1980s and early 1990s. Notably absent from this array of culprits were large commercial banks, with an exception or two.Unfortunately, regulators failed to see or act on the growing problems until they had escalated into a full-scale financial crisis. The Securities and Exchange Commission failed to enforce adequate capital and liquidity requirements on investment banks, including Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, which had trillion-dollar balance sheets funded by volatile and expensive short-term wholesale funds.As a consequence of the crisis, the offending investment banks and S&Ls were sold, liquidated or converted into regulated banking companies. The financial system has stabilized at historically high capital levels and the economy is growing again (albeit much too slowly).Today there are no major stand-alone investment banks engaged in high-risk trading for their own accounts. After much turmoil and hundreds of billions of dollars in losses, they are finally gone. Investment banking now either is part of the regulated commercial-banking industry or is conducted in small boutique firms that are not highly leveraged. A separate hedge-fund industry exists for private investors interested in proprietary trading, private equity, exotic securitizations, and other high-risk businesses.This is a positive change for the safety and soundness of the financial system. Yet almost unbelievably, there are calls to restore Glass-Steagall, re-create stand-alone investment banks, and allow them to operate once again outside the regulated banking system. The administration and Congress should not even consider putting America's economy at risk that way again."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp; Finance: Citigroup Holders Approve Pay Plan," Apr 26, 2017",115.16,0,"Citigroup Inc. shareholders cast 95% of their votes at Tuesday's annual meeting in support of the bank's compensation plan for top executives, following a jump in the stock price and a pay cut for Chief Executive Michael Corbat.That reversed tepid support last year, when the bank's annual ""say on pay"" resolution received 64% of votes cast. The average bank in the S&P 500 index received 91% support, according to proxy-advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.In contrast to a rancorous Wells Fargo & Co. annual shareholder meeting that also took place Tuesday, Citigroup's conclave was relatively placid. But it wasn't totally uneventful: There was one major interruption when a group took the stage at the Cooper Union hall in New York for a few minutes to protest the bank's lending related to the l Dakota Access Pipeline.Otherwise, Citigroup shareholders backed the bank's overall strategy, overwhelmingly rejecting a breakup proposal. The current board also received more than 98% support from voters. The breakup measure got 2.5% of votes cast, down from 3.5% last year.A more extensive debate on the bank's performance could await Citigroup in July, when it will hold its first investor day meeting in several years.The bank succeeded in tamping down the major concern at last year's meeting, executive pay. Following last year's say-on-pay vote -- which isn't binding but an indication of shareholder support -- Citigroup's board made a handful of changes.For one, it cut Mr. Corbat's pay. For 2016, Mr. Corbat is expected to receive total compensation of $15.5 million, a 6% decrease from the previous year.That helped the bank match up more favorably with its stock performance and peers. The cut came despite Citigroup stock generating a 16% total return in 2016 compared with negative 4% in 2015, when Mr. Corbat's pay rose.Last year, proxy-advisory firms Glass Lewis & Co. and ISS recommended that shareholders vote against the say-on-pay resolution. This year, both firms recommended voting in favor, citing the measures the bank took after last year's vote.""The board has demonstrated sufficient responsiveness,"" ISS said in a report this month.Like most big banks, Citigroup's stock has jumped since the U.S. presidential election, partly on hopes that the Trump administration will give firms a wider berth to return capital.Citigroup returned $11 billion to shareholders last year and expects to increase that amount. Mr. Corbat told shareholders that Citigroup pressed the case for a bigger payout when the bank made its 2017 stress-test submission to regulators.The company made other changes after the 2016 vote, including shifting more pay from cash to stock and basing future performance-based stock grants partly on 2019 return on capital and profitability.Mr. Corbat acknowledged that the bank fell short on several measures in 2016, such as declines in net income and return on assets.He said that was driven by decisions to make new investments in several areas, including credit cards, consumer banking in Mexico and stock trading, which will generate faster growth and capital return."
Wells Fargo,Wells Fargo Directors Face Shareholders' Ire," Apr 26, 2017",115.06,0,"Shareholders at scandal-scarred Wells Fargo & Co. voted Tuesday to keep all 15 of the bank's directors, but in a stinging rebuke rarely seen in corporate elections did so in some cases by slim margins.After a three-hour annual meeting replete with shareholder outbursts and one unscheduled break to remove an angry investor, the San Francisco company announced voting tallies that showed the toll of the aggressive sales practices last fall that cost Wells Fargo $185 million in fines.Most striking, the bank's nonexecutive chairman, Stephen Sanger, garnered only 56% of shareholders' support, far below the 95% or more that most directors usually get with little fanfare. The head of the bank's risk committee, Enrique Hernandez, fared even worse, getting a 53% vote. In all, nine directors got votes of less than 75%. None of the board's longer-serving directors could muster more than 80% of the vote.""The outcome is a wake-up call that directors at U.S. companies may no longer glide through a crisis without taking individual hits in reputation,"" said Stephen Davis, associate director of Harvard Law School's Programs on Corporate Governance and Institutional Investors. ""Institutional investors are staffing up for regular, tougher scrutiny of directors.""Mr. Sanger, a former General Mills chief executive who spearheaded the board's response to last year's fake-account scandal, said Tuesday that shareholders ""sent the entire board a clear message of dissatisfaction.""Even so, neither Wells Fargo nor the board said there would be any immediate changes in the wake of the vote. Instead, Mr. Sanger reiterated what the bank has told some large shareholders privately: that six directors will step down from the board within the next four years when they hit the mandatory retirement age of 72 years old.Mr. Sanger, who turned 71 this month, added that the board is ""urgently looking"" to add new talent beyond the two directors who joined the board in February. Those two directors, along with CEO Timothy Sloan, who joined the board last year, received 99% majorities from shareholders on Tuesday.For Wells Fargo, while the unanimous re-election of directors is a relief, the fact that a majority of directors received less than three-quarters support suggests that the bank's board may face continuing pressure to make more changes.The breadth and scale of shareholders' limited support, especially with no alternative board candidates, is ""very rare,"" said Sandeep Dahiya, an associate professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business.Over the past 10 years, only 22 directors a year, on average, at S&P 500 companies received less than 60% of the vote for re-election, according to ISS Analytics, the data arm of proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.Focus on the board election built earlier this month, when ISS recommended that shareholders vote against re-electing 12 Wells Fargo directors who served while the sales practice issues occurred. Some large shareholders thought the board was slow to react to the sales-practices problems, but have cited improvements in the board's response more recently.Though Wells Fargo's board has been active over the past several months in seeking shareholder feedback, issuing detailed results of an independent investigation over the sales practices and clawing back about $183 million in pay from executives, Mr. Dahiya said more actions may be necessary.He said in the coming months it is possible some board members may voluntarily depart as typically the more dissatisfied shareholders are, the more likely directors are to leave. The bank and board declined to comment beyond an earlier press release Tuesday.Tensions flared at the bank's meeting, held at a golf resort's conference center in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. Among the roughly 300 shareholders attending, four shareholders spoke out of turn, yelling at the board or management to voice complaints.The first shareholder outburst prompted Mr. Sanger to halt the meeting for several minutes while the investor was removed from the room.Before Mr. Sanger read the vote tallies at the end of the meeting, former and current bank employees and customers came to a microphone, sometimes fighting back tears. Some discussed health problems and stress they say were brought about by the bank's aggressive sales culture. Others recalled decisions by the bank to foreclose their home.Mr. Sloan in most of these cases directed the speakers to follow up with Wells Fargo officials after the meeting.One former employee apologized to customers for the bank's aggressive sales tactics, and said that they were why she left the company. Mr. Sloan, in response, asked her to ""consider coming back,"" adding that the bank has rehired more than 1,000 employees who had left because they didn't feel comfortable with the sales practices.A bank spokesman said most of those rehires, since September, are within the retail banking unit but declined to comment further."

Wells Fargo,Markets &amp; Finance: Risk-Wary Banks Chill the Bitcoin Market," Apr 27, 2017",113.43,0,"At least three bitcoin exchanges have said in recent weeks that they can't process transactions in dollars, as global banks pull back from sectors they deem too risky.Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by market share, last week said its customers couldn't withdraw or deposit any currencies because the Taiwanese banks that handle its transactions were blocking all requests. OKCoin International, the Hong Kong-based arm of one of China's biggest bitcoin exchanges, and BTC-e have warned users of disruptions in U.S.-dollar transactions.Earlier this month, Bitfinex sued Wells Fargo & Co., alleging it had refused to process some bitcoin-related transactions through the Taiwanese banks.A week later, Bitfinex withdrew the suit, acknowledging that Wells Fargo has no legal obligation to serve every customer, Philip Potter, the exchange's chief strategy officer, said in an interview.Wells Fargo declined to comment.Bitcoin, a digital currency launched in 2009, runs on a decentralized network of computers and isn't backed or controlled by any government. Users purchase bitcoin with U.S. dollars or other currencies.Many bitcoin exchanges have accounts with local banks that rely on larger ""correspondent banks"" to facilitate wire transfers and process transactions that involve foreign currencies. But global banks have long been wary of even indirect interactions with bitcoin exchanges, for fear of being held liable if bitcoin users -- who are difficult to identify -- are involved in illegal or shady activities, said Ross Delston, a former U.S. banking regulator and anti-money-laundering consultant.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. prohibits banks it transacts with from dealing with virtual-currency exchanges, according to an internal document seen by The Wall Street Journal. Standard Chartered PLC also doesn't process such transactions, according to a spokesman.To be able to transact with the wider financial system, bitcoin exchanges must play cat-and-mouse, said Bitfinex's Mr. Potter, continually switching bank accounts.""They close one account, we open another somewhere else,"" Mr. Potter said. ""It's a battle, but it looks like one that we appear to be losing, largely because we're the largest such exchange in the world and we've got the biggest target painted on our back.""Bitcoin is also drawing more regulatory scrutiny. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last month rejected two separate proposals for bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds, saying the lack of transparency could leave investors open to fraud and manipulation. The agency this week said it would review one of the rejections. China's central bank is considering requiring bitcoin exchanges to verify a client's identity and adhere to banking regulations, the Journal reported last month.The market value of all cryptocurrencies this month hit a record $30 billion, two-thirds in bitcoin, according to CoinMarketCap. But trading has plummeted this year as regulatory pressure has risen in China -- which accounted for 90% of volume last year, according to research site CryptoCompare. Over the past month, China's share of the much-diminished total has averaged just 11.2%, the site says.In response to scrutiny from regulators, global banks over the past year to 18 months have ratcheted up their ""know-your-customer"" checks by re-examining existing clients, said Benjamin Quinlan, chief executive officer of Hong Kong-based financial services consultancy Quinlan & Associates.Bitcoin exchanges barred from transacting in U.S. dollars or other currencies effectively forgo their most common function, as places to buy cryptocurrencies with money stored in the traditional financial system -- though users can still convert bitcoin into other virtual currencies such as Monero or Zcash.Bitfinex's difficulties in the past year include the loss of around 120,000 bitcoin, worth some $65 million, to hackers last August.The exchange has since reimbursed customers. It was also fined $75,000 by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission last June after failing to register as a commodities exchange."
Wells Fargo,President Trump's First 100 Days: Wary Investors Dial Back the 'Trump Trade'," Apr 28, 2017",115.5,1,"Markets are signaling caution after investors greeted President Donald Trump's election with enthusiasm.Bets on higher economic growth, inflation and interest rates -- which became known as the ""reflation trade"" -- have eased since the election. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is lower than it was when Mr. Trump took office, including a decline Wednesday after the White House unveiled its tax proposal. The U.S. dollar has retreated from a 14-year high hit after the election.Many popular postelection wagers took a hit last month after Republicans failed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, highlighting the difficulties they could face advancing new legislation even while holding the White House and both houses of Congress.As hopes for swift enactment of business-friendly tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and infrastructure spending have waned, investors have dialed back on stocks that were expected to benefit from such shifts, like bank and industrial shares. They have poured money into companies that have generally served up better-than-average returns since the financial crisis, such as large technology companies.Strong earnings reports from bellwether companies including McDonald's Corp. and Caterpillar Inc. helped stocks rally broadly this week, propelling the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite past 6000 for the first time.""People will ultimately look through that stuff and focus on reality, and the reality is we're on a pretty significant upswing when it comes to earnings data,"" said Nathan Thooft, co-head of global asset allocation at Manulife Asset Management. ""On top of that, we have a very supportive economic backdrop.""Other moves have reversed course. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note remains above its Election Day level of 1.867%, yet has fallen to 2.298% Thursday from 2.461% the day before Mr. Trump was sworn in. The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, is above where it was on Nov. 8 but has fallen more than 2% since Jan. 19.Few money managers are ready to declare the so-called reflation trade dead. Data pointing to economic expansion in the U.S. and around the world persist. The reflation trade has tended to regain some steam on signs of progress on Mr. Trump's agenda, including in recent sessions as the White House was preparing to release general principles for tax legislation.""I think the market's hopeful, but skeptical, and to the extent you get anything of substance, that's the icing on the cake,"" said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank."
Wells Fargo,Maybe the Glass-Steagall Was Largely Full," May 2, 2017",117.36,1,"How soon we forget. In the sixth paragraph of William M. Isaac and Richard M. Kovacevich's ""The Shattered Arguments for a New Glass-Steagall"" (op-ed, April 26), the authors state: ""Unfortunately, regulators failed to see or act on the growing problems until they had escalated into a full-scale financial crisis."" Yet two paragraphs later, they write, ""Investment banking . . . is part of the regulated commercial-banking industry,"" as if such regulation is now endowed with a benevolent oversight capability that will forever keep us safe. Glass-Steagall was enacted in the 1930s and worked reasonably well until Travelers merged with Citigroup and Congress changed the law, with President Clinton signing it.Fewer than 10 years later, a financial crisis of historic proportions struck. The authors assert that the Glass-Steagall repeal wasn't a contributing factor (and that they know who the culprits were at the heart of the crisis, ""20 or so institutions"").After four decades in the commercial-banking business, I support a clear, hard-line rule like Glass-Steagall.Charles FentonTustin, Calif.Messrs. Isaac and Kovacevich must be living in one of those parallel universes Stephen Hawking and others speak of. For 66 years (1933 to 1999) the U.S. economy didn't have a serious systemwide financial crisis. Nine years after Glass-Steagall was seen as ""no longer appropriate,"" we suffered the worst crash since the Great Depression.The large banks which ""survived because they were diversified"" must also exist in this parallel timeline. All of them, with the possible exception of Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan Chase, had to be bailed out. That we made a profit doesn't change the fact that they had dug themselves (and the rest of the economy) a very deep hole they couldn't get out of.Dodd-Frank is a disaster. Its 14,000-plus pages don't do what Glass-Steagall did in 37 pages. It's putting the smaller banks out of business, and its loopholes leave us open to repeating the crash of 2008. The CDOs and other high-risk ""instruments"" are again being issued, and if Warren Buffett can't figure them out, it's unlikely even those creating them can.It took having a ""panic"" every 10 to 15 years of our first 150 years before we accepted that banks needed to be regulated to protect them (and us) from themselves. One of the most important parts was keeping them from getting ""too big to fail."" I hope it won't take another 150 to relearn the lesson."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp; Finance: Ruling Bolsters Miami Suits," May 2, 2017",118.77,0,"WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court handed a partial victory to the city of Miami Monday, ruling it was authorized to bring lawsuits alleging Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. engaged in financial-crisis-era discriminatory lending that led to urban blight and falling property values.The court said in its 5-3 ruling, however, that Miami in future proceedings will have to establish that the banks caused direct harm to the city -- not attenuated, downstream effects -- a high standard that could prove challenging to meet.The court's opinion, written by Justice Stephen Breyer, concluded that Miami had legal standing to bring the lawsuits under the Fair Housing Act, which bars discrimination in housing sales and rentals, as well as in related real-estate transactions.The court rejected the banks' argument that the city wasn't an appropriate party to bring a claim under the law. Miami's alleged economic injuries ""fall within the zone of interests that the FHA protects,"" Justice Breyer wrote.Miami is one of several major cities that have brought similar claims against mortgage lenders. The municipalities are suggesting that discriminatory housing policies by banks can harm not only homeowners and buyers, but also cities themselves, given the high foreclosure rates, blight and urban decay that can follow. The court's ruling Monday found that this theory is legally plausible.The Supreme Court ruling sends the case back to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta to review whether the banks' alleged misconduct has a ""direct relation"" to the injuries the city alleges.Miami City Attorney Victoria Mendez said she was ""extremely pleased"" with the ruling and looked forward to additional court proceedings.A Bank of America spokesman said the company ""is committed to the goals and intent of the Fair Housing Act"" but added, ""We believe these claims are without merit and we will continue to defend our interests in this matter."" Wells Fargo said the Supreme Court announced stringent standards, and it ""will be very difficult for Miami or any other municipality to show the required connection between the claimed damages and unsubstantiated allegations about our lending practices, which do not reflect how we operate in the communities we serve.""The ruling produced a rarely seen coalition at the court, with conservative Chief Justice John Roberts joining the court's four liberals to form a five-justice majority. That lineup has occurred only a handful of times in the chief's 12-year tenure, most notably in the court's 2012 ruling that saved President Barack Obama's health-care law.Credit: By Brent Kendall and Jess Bravin"
Wells Fargo,Squeeze on Car Loans Deepens Sales Drop --- By AnnaMaria Andriotis and Christina Rexrode," May 4, 2017",114.98,0,"Wells Fargo & Co. has spent roughly nine months working to reform the sales culture that led to a $185 million fine, public humiliation and the departure of its chief executive. Now, the bank is confrontinga new challenge: growing again.So far, the San Francisco-based lender has focused on cutting costs and urging investors to be patient, though shareholders, analysts and some employees question how the bank will match its past performance without the sales tactics that got it in trouble.Complicating the bank's challenge are broader factors including low interest rates and a sluggish U.S. economy. ""If you turn the clock back 10 years ago, we were in an environment where the economy was growing more quickly and revenues, candidly, were a little bit easier to come by,"" Chief Executive Timothy Sloan said during an investor conference last week.Wells Fargo was fined $185 million in September by regulators for opening as many as 2.1 million accounts that used fictitious or unauthorized customer information. The bank and regulators disclosed then that the bank had fired 5,300 employees over five years for improper behavior including opening up accounts for customers without their knowledge.Since the fall, the bank's revenue growth has slipped for the first time in years. Its shares are the worst performing of the four biggest U.S. banks both year to date and since the November election.Asked about growth, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman noted the bank's diversified business model and strong, steady results as well as opportunities in its wholesale, wealth and investment management, and consumer businesses.Getting the retail division right is crucial for Mr. Sloan and other Wells Fargo executives. It sits in the bank's community banking unit, which last year accounted for more than 50% of Wells Fargo's overall net income.Wells Fargo's return on equity, a key measure of profitability, was down to 11.5% last quarter from its recent high above 14% in 2014.Even as it contends with broader economic trends affecting all banks, Wells Fargo must address lingering and potentially distracting impacts of the scandal.Agreements with regulators have put the bank in a less likely position to ask for approval on certain deals it would have pursued in the past.In December, the bank was sanctioned by U.S. regulators over its ""living will"" contingency plan, required of all banks, on how it would avoid a taxpayer bailout if it were about to go bankrupt. In March, it was downgraded on its ability and willingness to serve lower-income populations. The bank later passed the living-will test, and it is cooperating with other investigations.As it moves ahead, Wells Fargo has many among its 75,000 retail-bank employees who feel hamstrung by the company's new way of doing business. The bank eliminated product sales goals, concluding they had been emphasized too much and led employees to use questionable tactics to meet their numbers.A new incentive-compensation system this year seeks to change the orientation of the retail division from lofty product-sales goals to a focus on customers' overall satisfaction.Questions, however, persisted about the new strategy and growth during the bank's investor day last month.""It seems like a lot of what you're saying over retail strategy is pretty ambitious, and it seems like there's a fundamental tension between a lot of what you're trying to do,"" UBS Securities LLC analyst Saul Martinez said during the investor day.Mary Mack, the executive in charge of Wells Fargo's retail branches, responded to Mr. Martinez that there is ""alignment"" between the business changes she has enacted and the bank's growth plans. She also told analysts Wells Fargo was increasing its ""loans, deposits and investments.""She is also focused on shifting the bank's culture through manager training this summer and recent executive shuffling in her unit.""We have to help people continue to get comfortable with the change and create clarity"" for employees, she said in a recent interview.In preparing for certain reviews recently, a bank finance manager advised some regional executives they should be prepared for conversations with Ms. Mack to shift from seeking stability postscandal ""to growth and strategies around spurring growth,"" according to an April email reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.Yet some employees have expressed concern it isn't clear how to drive new business absent the bank's prior emphasis on product sales. One executive said questions among employees include: ""How am I going to grow the business . . . with these constraints? How do I do it in a way that doesn't appear to be sales pressure?""Meanwhile, Wells Fargo's numbers are falling. In March, the most recent data available, consumer checking-account openings at Wells Fargo fell 35% and credit-card applications dropped 42% from a year earlier.While the decline is less severe than seen soon after the September announcement, bank executives said last week that they don't expect the credit-card business to bounce back for a few quarters."
Wells Fargo,"MANSION --- Luxury House on the Prairie --- Sioux Falls, S.D., fueled by rapid growth, sees a boom in high-end homes; eschewing the 'oak everything' look"," May 5, 2017",115.19,1,"Morgan Stanley will soon prevent its clients from buying Vanguard Group's mutual funds, the latest big Wall Street brokerage to mostly shut out some of the index giant's funds.Starting next week, Morgan Stanley brokers will no longer be able to sell their clients new positions in Vanguard mutual funds, including its popular index offerings, the bank confirmed. Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, already doesn't allow new clients to purchase new shares of Vanguard's mutual funds, said Merrill brokers familiar with the matter, adding that it has been a longstanding policy of the Bank of America Corp.-owned brokerage.The brokerage arms of Wells Fargo & Co. and UBS Group AG, two of the other big traditional brokerages, haven't dropped Vanguard's funds, people familiar with their sales practices said.The restrictions come as Vanguard has boomed amid investors' embrace of funds that mimic broad indexes for a fraction of the cost of actively managed funds.The Malvern, Pa., firm brought in $289 billion last year, or 54%, of the $533 billion that flowed into all mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, according to research firm Morningstar Inc.Michael Wong, a wealth-management researcher with Morningstar, said he was surprised by the Morgan Stanley move. ""Vanguard, among the fund world, is a household name, so I would assume there would be some client demand for it,"" he said.Morgan Stanley, which oversees $2.2 trillion of client assets, says Vanguard's funds are unpopular with its clients. Vanguard's mutual funds represented less than 5% of Morgan Stanley's total mutual-fund assets, said bank spokesman Bruce Dunbar.Morgan Stanley clients currently invested in Vanguard mutual funds won't be forced to sell, and they can add to those positions through early next year. The brokerage will continue to offer Vanguard exchange-traded funds, said Mr. Dunbar.Vanguard is unusual among fund firms because it has a policy of not paying other firms to sell its funds. Many fund firms have long paid for shelf space on platforms or had revenue-sharing agreements with brokerages.A spokeswoman for Vanguard said, ""We share in the disappointment of advisers who are not able to access conventional shares of our mutual funds,"" adding that Vanguard doesn't pay any brokerage firm or its advisers for the distribution of its funds.Merrill, meanwhile, has for some time restricted the sale of new shares of Vanguard mutual funds to clients who don't have an existing position, said Merrill brokers familiar with the matter. Clients who come to the firm with existing positions can add to those, as long as they have research coverage by Merrill's chief investment office or a Morningstar analyst, they added.As at Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch's ban on buying Vanguard mutual funds doesn't apply to Vanguard ETFs. And investors who direct their own investments through Merrill Edge, Bank of America's self-service investment platform, can buy Vanguard mutual funds and ETFs without restrictions.Brokers at both firms say they usually favor ETFs, including Vanguard's, for investors who want a passive investment strategy because they tend to be cheaper and more tax efficient than mutual funds.Morgan Stanley, which has more than 15,000 brokers, said it is removing the Vanguard funds as part of a broader overhaul of its mutual-fund offerings.Over the past several months, the firm has been cutting 25% of funds it deems less popular or underperforming, a process it kicked off to help it comply with the Labor Department's fiduciary rule requiring brokers to act in the best interest of retirement savers.AdvisorHub earlier reported Morgan Stanley's removal of Vanguard funds."
Wells Fargo,Business News: Morgan Stanley to Drop Vanguard From Offerings," May 5, 2017",114.71,0,"Bank of America Corp. is the stingiest of the big U.S. banks. But its depositors don't seem to care.Last year, the bank paid an average of 0.08% for its interest-bearing deposits in the U.S. That was around half the rate paid by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. or Wells Fargo & Co. and a fraction of what firms such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Ally Financial Inc. paid.Yet Bank of America kept raking in customers' money. Such deposits increased $33 billion over 2015.Bank of America's ability to keep paying next to nothing highlights the built-in advantages of big banks as well as changes in consumer attitudes toward deposits. For investors, it indicates some banks may be able to increase rates more slowly than in past Federal Reserve rate-raising cycles, bolstering profits.Indeed, Bank of America's low deposit costs helped boost its profit margins and played a part in pushing the bank to a 40% first-quarter profit increase from a year earlier.While the Federal Reserve raised rates again in the quarter, the trend didn't change for Bank of America. Its average cost of U.S. interest-bearing deposits was just 0.09% and deposits in its consumer-banking business increased by a further $29 billion from the fourth quarter, according to the bank's quarterly earnings presentation.By holding the line on deposits, Bank of America gains a competitive advantage. Consider that it paid $617 million for about $796 billion in U.S. interest-bearing deposits in 2016, according to bank regulatory filings, far less than what J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo paid for only a bit more in funds.And Bank of America's interest payout came in below Goldman's $828 million expense or the $822 million Ally forked out -- even though those banks have just $115 billion and $79 billion of deposits, respectively.Consumers clearly could make more by putting their money elsewhere. Had Bank of America customers moved all their money to J.P. Morgan, they would have made $700 million more at its average deposit-cost rate. Move it all to Goldman and they would have pocketed $5.1 billion more.That they haven't moved money elsewhere speaks to the stickiness of deposits. It also bolsters a central argument by banks in the face of calls they should be broken up: Customers value their breadth and the different services they offer.Bank of America, for example, had 4,559 branches in the U.S. and 15,939 ATMs at the end of the first quarter.Goldman Sachs Bank USA, on the other hand, has no ATMs and retail customers can't walk into a Goldman branch.Indeed, depositors place a premium on convenience, like being able to access thousands of ATMs or transfer money using their smartphones.Abby Trexler of New York has kept savings and checking accounts at J.P. Morgan Chase for more than a decade and says she has no plans to move them to a higher-yielding account. A number of years ago, she had an account with an online bank and found it cumbersome to get money in and out.Ms. Trexler, who is in her mid-30s and works in communications, likes Chase's ubiquitous ATMs and mobile technology. For instance, she and her sisters used the bank's payments feature to split the cost of their parents' Christmas gifts last year.""There are people like me willing to give up a little bit,"" Ms. Trexler said. ""It just seems like such a hassle to not be able to walk in on every corner and get done what I need to get done.""Younger consumers also prefer the largest U.S. banks because they think their technology is better, said Jim Miller, senior director at market-research firm J.D. Power. Customers under 40 give the bigger banks higher satisfaction marks for things like mobile banking. This age group is particularly important to keep happy because they are five times more likely to switch banks than older customers, according to J.D. Power research.Another factor working in the big banks' favor: They serve a lot of depositors with small accounts. For those savers, gains from switching to a higher-yielding account typically aren't worth the hassle, especially in an age of superlow rates.Say a depositor has $3,000 in a standard Bank of America savings account. On the face of it, that person could gain a lot by moving from such an account, which typically pays about 0.01%, to GS Bank, which offers a savings account with a 1.05% yield.The practical impact is far smaller: The gain from switching, over a year, would only be around $31."
Wells Fargo,"Stingy Banks Pull In Depositors --- Bank of America pays lower rates than rivals, but its services attract a stream of money"," May 9, 2017",114.68,0,"Wells Fargo & Co. is investigating whether three senior executives in Chicago inappropriately steered business toward certain individuals in its private-banking unit, according to people familiar with the matter. The probe comes months after the bank reached a settlement over a sales-practice scandal in its retail unit.Two weeks ago, Wells Fargo suspended Chip Flannagan, a senior vice president and regional managing director for the bank's Chicago private-banking operations, according to the people. Wells Fargo also suspended two other private-banking executives as part of its investigation: senior vice presidents Scott Landau and J. Scott Voigt.Wells Fargo declined to make Messrs. Flannagan, Landau and Voigt available to comment. Messrs. Flannagan and Landau didn't return phone calls seeking comment, while Mr. Voigt couldn't be reached.The investigation is looking into whether Messrs. Flannagan, Landau and Voigt steered Wells Fargo clients toward certain individuals within Wells Fargo's private-banking unit and away from other employees, such as brokers, who may have been better equipped to handle certain client needs, the people said.The bank's concern is that in some cases the expectation to meet growth goals within the private-banking unit may have taken precedence over the needs of clients, the people said. Meeting such goals also allowed certain employees to collect bonuses, the people said. It wasn't clear if any clients were harmed by the alleged actions, the people said.A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said the allegations ""deserve serious attention, and they are receiving it."" She said the investigation is continuing. ""We owe it to all parties involved to let the process proceed in a way that guarantees a fair and thorough outcome,"" she said.The alleged practices, which aren't related to the bank's sales-practice scandal in which it agreed to pay a $185 million settlement in September, had been occurring in the bank's Chicago wealth-management branch for some time and don't appear to include other regions, the people said."
Wells Fargo,Wells Investigates Whether Executives Steered Business," May 11, 2017",115.51,1,"In the first episode, Martin complains that Nan isn't paying enough attention to him. She's ignoring his needs and taking him for granted. While acknowledging that these are ""first-world problems,"" he stares into the camera and says, ""I just think we have a little work to do.""Another romantic comedy about busy millennials trying to make love work? Not exactly. Martin is a dog and Nan is his owner. And, yes, Martin talks -- to himself anyway.Premiering May 17 on ABC, ""Downward Dog"" is about a self-obsessed, somewhat melancholy mutt with thoughts viewers can hear and a distracted but loving owner. The series took an unusual route to its television debut, starting as web series made for laughs for friends and ending up debuting at the Sundance Film Festival.The show has generated buzz from the web series and four episodes of the ABC series that were screened at Sundance. ""I had genuine love and affection for it right out of the gate,"" said ABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey.Creators Samm Hodges and Michael Killen didn't have grand ambitions for ""Downward Dog"" when they started making webisodes to pass the time between shooting commercials at Mr. Killen's Pittsburgh-based production and visual-effects company Animal Inc.""It was just for fun,"" said the 33-year-old Mr. Killen, who helped develop Taco Bell's talking Chihuahua commercials.The webisodes caught the eye of manager Jimmy Miller, whose clients include Judd Apatow. Mr. Miller signed the duo and struck a deal with television and movie production company Legendary Entertainment. He started setting up meetings with networks and streaming services, much to the surprise of Messrs. Hodges and Killen.""We never wrote the web series to be a TV show,"" said Mr. Hodges, 32, adding, ""It's challenging to write for a protagonist with no thumbs that can't do anything.""The web series, where episodes ran only a few minutes, focused primarily on the dog and his owner. For a TV show, the pair added an on-again, off-again love interest for Nan as well as a job as a creative director in an advertising agency, ensuring that the show would be more than just Martin's deep thoughts.""The dog is a lens for human life,"" said Mr. Hodges, who also voices Martin's inner dialogue.HBO, Showtime and Amazon Prime expressed interest but Mr. Miller also wanted to shop it to broadcast networks. That seemed a longshot to Messrs. Hodges and Killen since the character of Martin wasn't being played for laughs and hijinks. The dog doesn't ride a skateboard, drive a car or prance around on two legs.""It was an interesting new way in presenting a talking dog with a lot of personal angst, something a commercial entity wouldn't necessarily want,"" Mr. Killen said. Ned, the dog who plays Martin in the ABC series, is a rescue animal with such distinctive eyes and appearance, the producers can't turn to a backup dog to stand in for Ned in any scenes.ABC ended up aggressively bidding for the project and although the two executives who had championed acquiring it -- Entertainment President Paul Lee and comedy head Samie Falvey -- subsequently left the network, it found new supporters in Ms. Dungey and Ben Sherwood, president of Walt Disney Co.'s Disney/ABC TV unit.""The 'Downward Dog' pilot stood out as an incredibly heartfelt, emotionally true and memorable piece of television,"" Mr. Sherwood said. ""It feels different from the start and not just because there is a thinking dog in it.""Mr. Sherwood wouldn't predict if the show will click with viewers but noted, ""there are 70 million to 80 million dogs in the U.S. and we hope they're watching with their owners.""Convincing an actor to co-star with a dog was no easy task. Allison Tolman, best known for her portrayal of Molly in season one of the FX drama ""Fargo,"" questioned her agent's sanity when she heard the pitch.""I was like, 'What, are we that desperate that we're looking at talking dog shows?' "" recalled Ms. Tolman, who plays Nan. ""My first reaction was not great, that's for sure.""After reading the script and watching the episodes online she was sold, in part because the show felt so real.""This is a really big sell that this dog can talk so everything else has to be super realistic and very natural,"" Ms. Tolman said.She has bonded with Ned but will only go so far for her co-star. Cleaning up after him, she said, ""is definitely not in my contract."""
Wells Fargo,Life &amp; Arts -- Television: A Talking Dog's Star Turn," May 11, 2017",115.03,1,"Merrill Lynch will unveil new commission-based retirement accounts next month, people familiar with the matter said, relaxing a wholesale move to fee accounts that the Bank of America Corp.-owned brokerage had planned to comply with the ""fiduciary rule.""Merrill opted to soften its stance after brokers and clients expressed concerns with the firm's one-size-fits-all approach to paying for retirement advice, the people said. Seven months earlier, Merrill announced fees, not commissions, would be the future for individual retirement accounts under the Labor Department's fiduciary rule requiring brokers to act in the best interest of retirement savers.Some brokers felt the shift left them at a competitive disadvantage since rivals like Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co. have opted to allow retirement savers to pay commissions in retirement accounts with few, if any, sales restrictions. Some of Merrill's retirement clients, meanwhile, didn't want to shift away from a compensation model they long understood.The new commission-based IRAs, set to launch June 12 just days after the fiduciary rule takes effect, are expected to be used by a small population of Merrill clients, specifically those with investments in money funds, brokered certificates of deposit and concentrated stock positions, the people said. Initially, the new accounts will only be able to house cash and banking deposits before expanding to include those additional investments, the people added.Merrill clients with $50 million or more with the brokerage will have the added option of being able to house private-equity and hedge-fund investments in a commission-based retirement account, the people said.Such investments aren't conducive for a fee-based structure since they typically don't require frequent advice, the people said, and converting them to a fee-based account likely wouldn't be in the best interest of clients, a legal liability under the fiduciary rule.The decision to not permit the sale of stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other products in those commission-based IRAs likely will make them an unattractive option for many clients affected by the firm's changes related to the rule, brokers at Merrill said. Still, some brokers welcomed the additional flexibility since it will help them accommodate clients in special situations, such as executives who have concentrated stock positions.Merrill chief Andy Sieg announced the new accounts to brokers on a conference call Thursday afternoon, following through on comments he made in March that there ""may be limited situations"" in which charging a retirement saver a recurring fee based on a percentage of assets wouldn't make sense.About $3 trillion of retirement assets has been put into play since the Obama-era fiduciary rule was unveiled last year.The rule, which seeks to eliminate conflicts from advice that often come when commissions are charged, has shaken up the U.S.'s biggest brokerages. Morgan Stanley, for example, has lowered commissions and slashed the number of mutual funds it sells, including those offered by the popular index-fund giant Vanguard Group."

Horton Inc. shares rising 1.1% to $33.45, Lennar Corp. climbing 1.3% to $51.03, Toll Brothers Inc. adding 1.2% to $37.44 and KB Home gaining 1.8% to $21.29.Each of the four stocks is up by double-digit percentages this year, while the S&P 500 has risen 7.3%.The day's moves came after a report showed the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index, a measure of sentiment among U.S. home builders, climbed in May to its second-highest reading since 2005. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected to see the gauge hold steady.Monday's report added to a string of upbeat readings for the housing industry. Home sales in the first quarter climbed to their highest level since the same period of 2007, the National Association of Realtors said Monday.The share of first-time buyers is rising back toward its historical average, according to data from the Census Bureau, and new households are more often choosing to buy homes rather than rent, home-tracker Trulia said this month. That has created fresh demand for new homes, as well as lifted shares of home-improvement companies.Shares of big-box retailer Lowe's Cos. have gained 20% this year, while paint maker Sherwin-Williams Co. has risen 24%.Data scheduled for release Tuesday could give home-builder shares another boost. U.S. single-family housing starts are expected to have risen 3.7% in April from the previous month, according to economists polled by the Journal.Upbeat earnings also could bolster shares of companies tied to the housing market. Home Depot Inc., shares of which are up 17% this year, is expected to report results on Tuesday."

Wells Fargo,Banks See Low Income Where the Rich Shop --- Branches crowd ritzy Manhattan district where struggling earners help institutions pass regulatory tests," May 19, 2017",112.87,1,"To any casual observer, the area just south of Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan is obviously wealthy: The blocks are crowded with skyscrapers, and stores include Versace and Ferrari. Diners can pick at the foie gras and caviar on La Grenouille's $172 prix fixe dinner menu.In the eyes of federal-bank regulations, though, that sliver of New York is a poor neighborhood where median incomes are relatively low.The anomaly has yielded a hidden benefit for banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. that have crowded branches into the area. Having robust branch representation in supposedly low-income areas gives them a better score on a key regulatory test that can help determine how fast they expand.It is all part of the Community Reinvestment Act, a roughly four-decade-old federal law designed to stop lending discrimination in low-income neighborhoods. In recent years, lawmakers and regulators have clashed over the legislation's efficacy. CRA proponents count it as a bulwark for those struggling to keep up in a financial system that has grown more unequal. Critics say the law's implementation encouraged banks to make bad loans that contributed to the financial crisis.Neighborhoods such as the one in Midtown Manhattan could add a new dimension to the debate, even though branch analysis is only one part of regulators' broader CRA evaluations. Its quirky treatment under the CRA is due to the fact that regulators who enforce the act rely on older, sometimes unreliable, Census Bureau data to determine an area's income level.Six of the 10 most popular poor areas for banks to have branches, including the Manhattan tract, are slated to lose that classification when more recent census data go into effect this year, according to regulators and data from ComplianceTech, a fair-lending software company. But bank regulators have been using the older data because they stick to a preset schedule of switching every five years.In one of these census tracts, a ""low income"" area in downtown San Francisco, one of the most expensive cities in the country, 53 branches pack into an area that census data indicate has only 1,783 residents. That is 52 more branches than the average U.S. poor district has, even though the San Francisco tract has far fewer residents than average.About 30 miles away in Menlo Park, Calif., a First Republic Bank branch on Facebook Inc.'s corporate campus is classified as lower income because the surrounding areas have lower incomes than the median of the broader area. But the only people with access to the branch are employees and guests of Facebook, which paid an average of $189,000 in stock-based compensation last year for each employee globally. Facebook and First Republic declined to comment.In Washington, guests of high-end hotels near the White House and elite lobbying firms have 19 branches to choose from, including three Bank of America Corp. locations. All of the branches give the banks credit for serving a lower-income community.Then there is Manhattan's census tract 102, the bustling Midtown blocks with the most lower-income bank branches per capita in the U.S., according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from ComplianceTech's LendingPatterns.com. Due to a paucity of residential buildings in the area, the district has only 230 residents, or about 10 for each of its 22 bank branches, according to the census data used by banking regulators.Banks have good reasons besides the CRA to be in such areas. They tend to include commercial districts that are densely populated with office workers who might want to visit a bank on a break. Tract 102 also has many tourists. But the areas often have few residential buildings, one reason that can explain the lower-income designation.""Banks can conform to the letter of the law, but not meet the purpose of CRA,"" says John Vogel, an adjunct professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business.The CRA was signed by President Jimmy Carter in 1977 to stop ""redlining,"" a practice where banks wouldn't lend money in poorer or minority neighborhoods. Bank regulators during the Clinton administration added a uniform test as a way to measure compliance more objectively.The vast majority of banks examined -- about 97% -- got a passing grade on the test between 2006 and 2015, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service.The penalties for falling short can be costly. In addition to the reputation hit, a low rating generally prevents banks from pursuing mergers, which can be a big disadvantage for small and midsize lenders. Bigger lenders have faced restrictions on mergers or other expansion when their ratings were downgraded.The CRA test looks at branch location by census tracts, which typically have a few-thousand people apiece. Tracts are sorted into four groups based on income. Banks get better marks for the two lower-income groupings."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp; Finance: Banks Eye Return to Payday Loans," May 22, 2017",112.11,1,"WASHINGTON -- Some banks want to take on payday lenders.Financial firms, spurred by the Trump administration's promises to deregulate, hope to return to offering short-term, high-interest loans after being pushed out of the sector by Obama-era rules. Two leading trade groups, the American Bankers Association and Consumer Bankers Association, recently proposed to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin several steps they say would encourage banks to offer such loans.The groups call for scrapping 2013 guidelines that forced banks to exit from the market. Also on their wish list is blocking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from rolling out the sweeping rules on payday lending proposed last year, which they say would hamper their return to the sector.Letting banks and credit unions offer small loans, proponents say, would help the millions of U.S. households that pay billions of dollars in fees each year to payday and auto-title lenders that often charge annual interest rates exceeding 300%.""We feel very strongly that we want to serve all our customer segments,"" said Mark Erhardt, senior vice president of retail product management at Fifth Third Bancorp.Fifth Third -- along with Wells Fargo & Co., Regions Financial Corp. and U.S. Bancorp -- was among the large banks that previously marketed deposit advance loans, which allowed their customers to borrow small amounts to weather cash crunches between paychecks. Banks like Fifth Third believe small loans can be profitable if they can offer them cheaply to a lot of customers.Still, don't expect banks to rush into the sector even if regulation changes, owing to the loans' thin profit margins. ""The biggest hurdle to community banks making more small-dollar loans is cost,"" said Joseph Gormley, assistant vice president of regulatory policy at the Independent Community Bankers of America. ""More or less, it costs them the same amount to make a $500 loan as it does a $20,000 loan.""The shifting political landscape has emboldened supporters of payday-alternative loans. The prospects for the CFPB's payday-loan rules have dimmed owing to Republican opposition to the bureau's broad regulatory authority. Meanwhile, the Trump administration recently appointed Keith Noreika, a private-sector banking lawyer, as acting comptroller of the currency after removing Thomas Curry, who had adopted the tougher standards for deposit advance loans in 2013.""A new comptroller is a fresh start on this issue,"" said Nick Bourke, director of consumer finance at Pew Charitable Trusts. ""Almost half of the households in this country who are living close to the edge financially can benefit from small credit from banks if it's structured in a right way."" Pew estimates 12 million Americans take out payday loans each year, spending $9 billion on loan fees.A spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said the agency's guidelines encourage banks to respond to customers' short-term credit needs.Banks all but withdrew from the market after the OCC and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. imposed tougher loan standards to limit banks' risk exposure and lower costs for consumers. Consumer advocates had criticized the costs of these loans, which often climbed into triple digits in terms of annual rates because of high upfront fees."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp; Finance: CME's U.S. Interest-Rate Contracts Business Is Running Hot," May 23, 2017",108.8,1,"A few years ago, CME Group Inc.'s main profit engine was stuck in low gear. Now, it is in overdrive. The futures exchange's biggest product line -- U.S. interest-rate contracts -- is enjoying record trading volumes as the Federal Reserve accelerates the pace of rate increases.From 2008 to 2015, the U.S. central bank kept short-term rates near zero, which limited trading activity in the contracts. Now with rates rising and inflation awakening, traders are jumping in and out of interest-rate futures as they speculate on the probability and timing of rate increases. On Wednesday, they will be scrutinizing minutes from the Fed's latest meeting for hints of its next move. That means Chicago-based CME can finally reap the benefits of the interest-rates empire it built a decade ago. The company merged in 2007 with its crosstown rival, the Chicago Board of Trade. The deal gave CME a near-monopoly in U.S. interest-rate futures, a position it has held despite attempts by rivals to grab market share.""If you want to trade anything in U.S. interest-rate futures, you're going to be trading on CME,"" said Christopher Harris, an analyst at Wells Fargo & Co.CME's position allows it to raise fees without losing customers, analysts say.In 2014, the firm pushed through its first big fee increase in five years, raising transaction fees for Treasury futures by 9% for its largest customers, alongside fee increases for energy, metals and other types of contracts.Since then it has bumped up fees for various interest-rate products each year, according to CME notices.The exchange operator also has rankled traders by introducing new fees for market-data usage.CME Chairman and Chief Executive Terry Duffy defended the moves on an April 27 phone call with analysts, saying the firm had long given away data for free and remained a ""low-cost provider"" compared with its competitors.Critics worry fees will keep rising. ""I don't see anything that would be a catalyst for fee reductions,"" said Neal Wolkoff, former chief executive of ELX Futures LP, a now-dormant exchange that challenged CME's grip on interest-rate futures. ""Usually, fee reductions come in the face of competition, and there just isn't any.""Adding to CME's dominance, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and other postcrisis rules encouraged trading to migrate from over-the-counter derivatives to futures, market observers say.In the OTC market, two companies trade with each other directly, instead of using an exchange.Research firm Tabb Group forecasts that 3.8 billion U.S. futures contracts will change hands in 2017, marking a fifth consecutive year of record volumes.Much of that growth will come from interest-rate futures, the volume of which is expected to increase 16% this year, a faster pace of growth than any other type of contract, Tabb says.Other CME products -- like energy and stock-market futures -- are better known to the general public.But interest-rate contracts have been the firm's biggest moneymaker for five of the past six years, responsible for around one-third of the revenue CME collects in trading and clearing fees.Several challengers have tried to create alternative venues for U.S. interest-rates futures trading, including NYSE Euronext Inc., the former parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, and ELX, which was backed by a group of Wall Street banks and trading firms. But those efforts failed to gain traction. Once a futures contract takes off, it is tough for competing exchanges to lure traders away from the primary exchange. Market participants tend to congregate in one place to trade, analysts say."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp; Finance: Morgan Stanley Cuts Broker Poaches," May 24, 2017",114.28,1,"Morgan Stanley will curtail its recruiting of veteran brokers, joining other big firms on Wall Street that are no longer willing to gorge on the pricey practice of paying top dollar to poach talent.The New York firm told brokerage managers Tuesday that it would ""significantly reduce experienced adviser recruiting"" to tamp down those costs, while spending more on supporting existing brokers and investments in new technology, according to a memo from wealth-management heads Shelley O'Connor and Andy Saperstein that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Morgan Stanley is the latest brokerage to say it wants to cut back its recruitment activities, which usually involved paying brokers six- or seven-figure signing bonuses, Wall Street's main mechanism of attracting brokers, assets and revenue.Such bonuses were structured as loans forgiven over as long as eight or nine years, with brokers initially getting paid up to 150% of the annual revenue they generated off fees and commissions. Such deals usually included back-end portions that brokers would earn after hitting certain asset and revenue targets over the life of the deal -- an arrangement that had become problematic under new retirement rules set to take effect next month since they could be perceived as a conflict of interest. Brokers who changed firms before the deal's term ended were usually forced to pay back a remaining portion.Executives had bemoaned the practice for years as costly and called it a ""zero-sum game"" among the four main brokerages -- Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, UBS Group AG and Wells Fargo & Co. -- as they routinely traded brokers with one another. Still, brokerage executives viewed it as a necessary pipeline for asset and revenue growth.The problem, recruiters say, is that brokerages were hesitant to pull back from recruiting if their rivals wouldn't. That was until UBS said last year that it would reduce by 40% the number of brokers it recruited annually.Following UBS's lead, Merrill this month told some executives that it would pause all recruiting after June 1 as it developed a new incentive package aimed at courting the industry's most valuable free agents, the Journal previously reported.Morgan Stanley will continue to honor recruitment agreements it has with brokers through June 16 and have a start date no later than Sept. 1, according to the memo to managers. In the meantime, Morgan Stanley is developing new recruiting policies that will be revealed in the coming weeks, the memo added.The money Morgan Stanley saves from its recruiting pullback will be funneled into a series of investments aimed at encouraging the firm's roughly 15,700 brokers to attract more client assets and revenue."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp; Finance: Fiduciary Rule Survives Critics for Now --- Labor leaves deadline in place but keeps open possibility of revision to regulation," May 24, 2017",116.87,1,"In the sun room of his newly renovated, 7,700-square-foot mansion in Sioux Falls, S.D., Kevin Tupy and his listing agent gazed at the luxury homes sprouting up on the plains.""That one's worth $7 million,"" said his agent, Liz Lloyd, pointing to a 12,000-square-foot brick mansion built around 2010. A few blocks away is a rustic-contemporary home that sold for nearly $2.5 million last year -- the record-high home sale for Sioux Falls.Mr. Tupy, 48, a venture capitalist, bought his six-bedroom contemporary home less than two years ago for $1.24 million. Now he and his wife, Delena, a homemaker and the reigning Mrs. South Dakota, are preparing to list the home for $1.5 million, to trade up to a larger home with more amenities.There's nothing little about these houses on the prairie. Fueled by a mix of business-friendly tax laws and rapid growth in the medical and financial fields, Sioux Falls is experiencing a boomlet in the luxury-home market.Some affluent buyers, not finding what they want in existing stock, are building their own -- and bringing new styles and amenities to town. Real-estate agents predict a wave of sales at record prices. But building big and pushing the boundaries of local tastes come with risks: It isn't unusual for million-dollar listings to sit on the market for years, or for homeowners to spend more than they can recoup when they sell.""Holy cow, things are busy"" said Bob Natz, a local home designer who says business has picked up since 2010. In the past year, his firm has designed three luxury homes, from $1 million to $1.5 million, with much of the demand coming from doctors. The two largest employers, medical providers Sanford Health and Avera, account for roughly 17,000 jobs in the city, which has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country at 2.8%. With a population of 178,500, the city saw a 3% growth in population last year. There is no state income tax, and favorable corporate and banking rules have attracted the likes of Citibank and Wells Fargo.Until recently, the luxury homes ""just weren't there,"" said Beth Jamison, president of the greater Sioux Falls real-estate association. While the market's median sale price is $183,000, there are now 16 homes currently listed for $1 million or more, said Aaron Rietsema of Hegg Realtors. Last year, eight homes priced at $1 million or more sold, up from six the previous year and four in 2014. Only four homes have ever sold for $2 million or more, including the record $2.49 million home sold in 2016 to basketball player Kirk Hinrich, agents said.That could soon change, said Kathy O. Allen, a Re/Max agent who says she has a home that could close in the $4 million range, setting a record. The most expensive home on the market publicly listed for sale, an ultramodern estate in the northeast corner of town, is listed for $2.45 million.Meanwhile, new luxury homes are rising. In 2016, there were 695 permits for new, single-family homes issued, nearly double the volume since the market low in 2011 and the highest since 2014, said the city's director of planning, Mike Cooper.The change is evident downtown, where a sushi shop and a farm-to-table cafe compete with dimly lit bars serving a local favorite, chislic -- hunks of fried beef served with toothpicks and a side of ranch dressing.An imposing stone clock tower on the low-slung skyline, built in the 1800s with ornate blocks of red Sioux quartzite, will soon be joined by a modern mixed-use condo project using the same quarried stone. The seventh-floor penthouses of that building will sell fully finished for about $1.8 million, said Chris Houwman, one of the developers.With new buyers come new ideas. Matthew Roach, 36, a partner at the Sioux Falls-based Pride Built Homes, says he has completed five homes since 2015, all of which bring something different to the rows of earth-toned, steeply pitched rooflines that dominate the area.""We like to call it coastal,"" Mr. Roach said about the style of his latest project, a newly built 5,050-square-foot, light-gray contemporary that has little resemblance to the typical Midwest rambler. The entry opens to a double-height foyer and an open floor plan with light-hickory flooring. Carrara marble in the kitchen ties together all-white cabinetry and an Arabesque backsplash.The house is wired for voice commands and home automation, and the roomy garage -- a must-have in the city because of the brutal winters -- holds five cars and includes an audio system. It was listed for $999,000 with the Fisher Sisters of Ameri/Star. The home is already under contract, Mr. Roach said, but he declined to disclose the buyer's name.""It was a big risk for us,"" Mr. Roach said, adding that this is one of the most expensive and unusual spec homes in the city. But he was encouraged by past projects: A Cape Cod-style home his firm built sold for $753,700 -- close to the $779,000 asking price -- in two days. A recent client had them remodel a home in the French-country style, and they expect an airy, modern Craftsman they built to have an offer before it hits the market.Like Mr. Roach, builders Troy Stallings, 61, and his wife and business partner Jane Shorma, 55, were tired of the finishes found in many Sioux Falls homes.""Everything is oak here -- oak cabinets, oak floor, oh God,"" said Mr. Stallings, who has been building there for 20 years.Instead, the couple in 2008 built an Old World-inspired stone home, with Peruvian limestone flooring and a free-standing maple-wood staircase. The asking price was about $1.5 million when the real-estate market stalled. So they decided to live in the 6,600-square-foot home full time in hopes of an uptick."
Wells Fargo,Markets &amp; Finance: Wells Sweetens Broker Bonuses --- Lender tries to lure top talent even as its rivals pull back from expensive incentives," May 26, 2017",69.5888,1,"Barron's began ranking financial advisors in 2004 with the goal of shining a spotlight on the best people in the business. Many stories had been written in the press over the years about bad financial advisors and the trouble they caused investors. Butthose stories held little benefit forour readers. What our readers wanted to know isthis: Who are the truly great financial advisors and what are they telling their clients?That'sthe question we'vetried to answerwith our advisor rankings.From the outset, the rankings have been a remarkable success. It is now accepted in the industry that the advisors ranked by Barron's representthe top 1% oftheir profession. In fact, it's become a badge of honor to be called a ""Barron's advisor,"" a phrase that's cropped up informally to describe the folks who make our lists. We began in 2004 with ourfirst ranking of the nation's top 100 advisors, working with asmall firm called the Winner's Circle, which we acquired in 2008. We published our first list oftheTop 100 Women Advisors in 2006. A year after that, we published a list oftheTop 100 Independent Advisors, meaning the best advisors not affiliated with the big full-service firms like Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, or UBS.One problem with all of these lists: Theywere dominated by advisors in NewYork, California, Florida, and afew other places where America's wealth is concentrated. We knew that we were missing great advisors in South Carolina, Alaska, Wyoming, and other states with smaller amounts of wealth.Our solution: the Top 1,000 state-by-state ranking, which we first published in 2009 and which we expanded to 1,200 spots in 2014. This list grants each state a minimum of six spots and allows proportionately more spots for states with greater assets.All of our advisor rankings are based on hard numbers: an advisor's assets under management and annual revenue generated, as well as length of time in the business, client retention, and philanthropic work. Critically important, we carefully check the regulatory record of each advisor we rank.Every year, readers ask us howto get in touch with specific advisors who are ranked in Barron's. This special advertising section, published 10 times a year, is an effort to make that easier. This section allows Barron's-ranked advisors-and only Barron's-ranked advisors-to publish their phone numbers, email addresses, and Website addresses. A link to this special advertising section can be found on the home page of Barron's Advisor Center: Barrons.com/AdvisorCenter. The site, launched in October 2016, is devoted to helping advisors serve their clients better. Advisors pay a fee to be listed in this section, but their participation has no bearing on their place in our rankings, nor does it guarantee that they will be ranked in future years. In our advisor rankings, as in all Barron's journalism, the readers' interests must come first and not be subordinated to any commercial considerations.We want to thank all Barron's-ranked advisors and their firms forhelping us make our rankings successful. We also want to thank these advisors forsetting the highest standards for their profession andforsharing their investing insights on a regular basis with Barron's readers.Advisors pay a fee to be listed in this section, but their participation has no bearing on their place in our rankings, nor does it guarantee that they will be ranked in future years."
Wells Fargo,Banks: Retailers' Troubles Leave U.S. Lenders Largely Unscathed," May 30, 2017",70.31,1,"""If these luxury homes are taking two to three years to sell, we've got to find new ways to sell,"" said Lee Harding of Keller Williams Ratchford Group. When he listed the home last spring at a reduced price of $1.25 million, he took out ads in national media and made a slick video with drone footage.He was preparing to put the home up for auction with a minimum sale price of $960,000. Then a local buyer approached them before the auction with an offer above the minimum bid, Mr. Stallings said, and it's now in contract. The couple plans to build again in the area, with an eye toward tech features that young professionals will like.Part of the problem facing the next wave of luxury home sellers will be setting expectations, said Rocky Rehfeldt, senior vice president at Sioux Falls-based lender Loft Advisors. ""North of $1.5 million, we have appraisal issues,"" he said, noting that lenders don't see value in some more extravagant renovations, which could hobble negotiations. Even when financing isn't involved, a lack of comparable properties at the top of the market can make it harder to justify passing the cost of some renovations onto the buyer.At the Tupy residence, a land surveyor was measuring the yard for a new outdoor pool. ""I think it's just expected"" if they want to get the $1.5 million asking price, Mr. Tupy said. He put about $350,000 into renovations, including a $200,000 home theater where he and his son, Curtis, watch sci-fi flicks.The Tupys, who have two teenage children, are selling to trade up to a larger home -- roughly 10,000 square feet -- with amenities like a wine cellar and a bigger yard. If he can't find what he's looking for, he may build new nearby.""It's not going to be a moneymaker,"" he said about the home's resale potential. ""But we got to enjoy it."""
Wells Fargo,Finance Watch," May 31, 2017",73.32,1,"Wells Fargo & Co. has spent roughly nine months working to reform the sales culture that led to a $185 million fine, public humiliation and the departure of its chief executive. Now, the bank is confrontinga new challenge: growing again.So far, the San Francisco-based lender has focused on cutting costs and urging investors to be patient, though shareholders, analysts and some employees question how the bank will match its past performance without the sales tactics that got it in trouble.Complicating the bank's challenge are broader factors including low interest rates and a sluggish U.S. economy. ""If you turn the clock back 10 years ago, we were in an environment where the economy was growing more quickly and revenues, candidly, were a little bit easier to come by,"" Chief Executive Timothy Sloan said during an investor conference last week.Wells Fargo was fined $185 million in September by regulators for opening as many as 2.1 million accounts that used fictitious or unauthorized customer information. The bank and regulators disclosed then that the bank had fired 5,300 employees over five years for improper behavior including opening up accounts for customers without their knowledge.Since the fall, the bank's revenue growth has slipped for the first time in years. Its shares are the worst performing of the four biggest U.S. banks both year to date and since the November election.Asked about growth, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman noted the bank's diversified business model and strong, steady results as well as opportunities in its wholesale, wealth and investment management, and consumer businesses.Getting the retail division right is crucial for Mr. Sloan and other Wells Fargo executives. It sits in the bank's community banking unit, which last year accounted for more than 50% of Wells Fargo's overall net income.Wells Fargo's return on equity, a key measure of profitability, was down to 11.5% last quarter from its recent high above 14% in 2014.Even as it contends with broader economic trends affecting all banks, Wells Fargo must address lingering and potentially distracting impacts of the scandal.Agreements with regulators have put the bank in a less likely position to ask for approval on certain deals it would have pursued in the past.In December, the bank was sanctioned by U.S. regulators over its ""living will"" contingency plan, required of all banks, on how it would avoid a taxpayer bailout if it were about to go bankrupt. In March, it was downgraded on its ability and willingness to serve lower-income populations. The bank later passed the living-will test, and it is cooperating with other investigations.As it moves ahead, Wells Fargo has many among its 75,000 retail-bank employees who feel hamstrung by the company's new way of doing business. The bank eliminated product sales goals, concluding they had been emphasized too much and led employees to use questionable tactics to meet their numbers.A new incentive-compensation system this year seeks to change the orientation of the retail division from lofty product-sales goals to a focus on customers' overall satisfaction.Questions, however, persisted about the new strategy and growth during the bank's investor day last month.""It seems like a lot of what you're saying over retail strategy is pretty ambitious, and it seems like there's a fundamental tension between a lot of what you're trying to do,"" UBS Securities LLC analyst Saul Martinez said during the investor day.Mary Mack, the executive in charge of Wells Fargo's retail branches, responded to Mr. Martinez that there is ""alignment"" between the business changes she has enacted and the bank's growth plans. She also told analysts Wells Fargo was increasing its ""loans, deposits and investments.""She is also focused on shifting the bank's culture through manager training this summer and recent executive shuffling in her unit.""We have to help people continue to get comfortable with the change and create clarity"" for employees, she said in a recent interview.In preparing for certain reviews recently, a bank finance manager advised some regional executives they should be prepared for conversations with Ms. Mack to shift from seeking stability postscandal ""to growth and strategies around spurring growth,"" according to an April email reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.Yet some employees have expressed concern it isn't clear how to drive new business absent the bank's prior emphasis on product sales. One executive said questions among employees include: ""How am I going to grow the business . . . with these constraints? How do I do it in a way that doesn't appear to be sales pressure?""Meanwhile, Wells Fargo's numbers are falling. In March, the most recent data available, consumer checking-account openings at Wells Fargo fell 35% and credit-card applications dropped 42% from a year earlier.While the decline is less severe than seen soon after the September announcement, bank executives said last week that they don't expect the credit-card business to bounce back for a few quarters."
Wells Fargo,Many Reasons for Decline in IPO Numbers," Jun 1, 2017",72.92,1,"There have been only three fleeting periods in the past half-century when the U.S. unemployment rate was as low as it is today. This would be cause for celebration but for one disturbing fact: Each was associated with boiling excesses that led to serious economic trouble.Low unemployment of the late 1960s preceded an inflation spiral in the 1970s. The late 1990s bred the dot-com bubble and bust. The mid-2000s saw the buildup and collapse of U.S. housing.While there is reason to believe today's economy isn't boiling over as in the past, those episodes call for caution.""It's not a matter of superstition, it's a matter of being mindful of the history of what such a low unemployment rate usually is followed by,"" said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.While initially a welcome development, low unemployment in the 1960s laid the groundwork for a buildup of wage and price pressures, spurred on by low interest rates and aggressive government spending programs.The unemployment rate dropped to 4.3% in September 1965 and then below 4%. Today's unemployment rate, also at 4.3%, could drop below 4% in the next year if it maintains its present trajectory.Unemployment fell again to 4.3% in January 1999. This time the inflation rate remained below 2% and it seemed that, unlike the late 1960s, the economy wasn't overheating.But asset prices -- the stock market in particular -- soared after what had already been a long climb. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shot above 10000 for the first time in March 1998. Highflying tech companies commanded billion-dollar valuations with no profits to report. In hindsight, an internet bubble grew out of control.Economic theory draws clear linkages between low unemployment and inflation. As companies compete for scarce workers, they bid up wages and raise prices on goods and services to protect profit margins. The textbooks don't spell out such a connection between low unemployment and financial bubbles. The tech boom of the late 1990s might have been dismissible as a one-off event had it not been for what happened next.Unemployment fell back to 4.4% by October 2006. It coincided with a home-price boom that happened even though broader inflation measures remained stable. When housing prices fell, a financial sector deeply exposed to mortgage credit collapsed and the economy entered the longest and deepest recession since the Great Depression.Each of those episodes was different, making it hard to map out a systematic connection with low unemployment.""I don't think we can compare the rate of unemployment now and the rate of unemployment 10 or 20 years ago,"" said Eugenio Aleman, a senior economist with Wells Fargo. ""The rate is similar, yes, and it's calculated the same way, but they don't represent the same thing. The economy is very different than 20 years ago.""Though prices for houses and stocks are rising again now, the get-rich-quick mania of the dot-com and housing bubbles isn't so ubiquitous today. Importantly, Americans aren't loading up on debt and, in fact, have spent much of the past 10 years reducing their debt burdens.Wage dynamics also have changed. Hourly wages increased more than 6% a year in the late 1960s. They rose over 4% a year in the late '90s and in the waning days of the housing bubble. Today, wage growth has been stuck around 2.5%.""Hitting a low point on the unemployment rate, compared to history, isn't a sufficient condition to say we're near a recession,"" said Gregory Daco, the head of U.S. Macroeconomics at Oxford Economics. ""The wage-inflation dynamic has not picked up, and that's clearly something different from the past.Other measures suggest the economy remains on a more even keel. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that after all these years of sluggish economic growth, today's economy is still producing goods and services at a slower rate than it is capable of producing.Other measures support this conclusion. In the 1990s and from 2005 to 2007, U.S. industries operated at more than 80% of their capacity, according to Federal Reserve data. In the 1960s, they were churning out goods at nearly 90% of factory capacity. By contrast, U.S. industrial capacity utilization maxed at just 79% in 2014 before an oil bust and industrial slowdown idled many factories and refineries.There is no telling how long this low unemployment period will last. Still, the broader historical lesson looms: Eventually these low unemployment cycles end."
Wells Fargo,U.S. News: When Low Jobless Rates End Badly," Jun 5, 2017",72.7,1,"The number of U.S. job openings hit a new high in April while hiring slowed, a sign that employers are struggling to find workers.The number of job openings rose by 259,000 to 6.04 million, the Labor Department said Tuesday, the highest level recorded since the government started tracking the figure at the end of 2000.

Wells Fargo,Corporate Bonds: Companies Follow Money Overseas --- More corporations are selling debt in other currencies; ECB and lower costs are a lure," Jun 14, 2017",73.47,0,"Move over Benjamin Franklin. It's all about the euros.American companies have sold $108.5 billion of bonds in other currencies this year to date, the most for any comparable period in a decade, according to data provider Dealogic. U.S. companies have done hefty issuance of euro-denominated debt but have also sold bonds in Canadian dollars and British pounds in 2017, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show.The issuers are some of the best-known firms. General Electric Co. issued $8.7 billion of euro bonds last month, one of the largest sales in the market's history. And AT&T Inc. sold $7.9 billion of euro bonds last week, according to Dealogic.This debt, known as reverse Yankee bonds, has become popular in recent years as companies look to diversify their portfolios, particularly if they have a lot of debt or plan to take on a lot to do a deal.""Most companies should be interested in diversifying their funding bases, especially in situations where you have large M&A transactions,"" said Hans Mikkelsen, a credit strategist at Merrill Lynch. ""You can do a little bit here and there instead of doing the entire deal in one currency.""At the moment, companies are benefiting from a favorable set of market conditions, analysts say. One thing that has lubricated the euro-denominated debt market recently: The European Central Bank has continued to buy corporate bonds as part of its stimulus policies. That has maintained a source of strong demand for euro-denominated corporate debt. At last week's ECB policy meeting, the bank did not announce plans to curtail its bond buying.The ECB waded into the corporate-bond market last year. But the environment wasn't as friendly for U.S. companies selling debt abroad because, in many cases, they had to pay high costs to swap that funding back to dollars. That's important for companies with mostly U.S. operations. AT&T gets the vast majority of its revenue in the U.S.Last year, the added cost of swapping euros for dollars rose sharply as investors contended with a crunch in that market. Cross-currency swap costs have turned lower this year, making it cheaper to issue in euros and end up with dollars, according to Wells Fargo & Co.'s securities unit.""This is the first time where you have a combination"" of both falling swap costs and strong demand for corporate bonds from the ECB, both of which are supporting issuance, said Nathaniel Rosenbaum, a director of credit strategy at Wells Fargo.To be sure, the added hedging costs can still complicate issuance of bonds denominated in other currencies. Merrill Lynch estimates that it likely cost AT&T about 0.1 percentage point more to issue in euros than in dollars if the company were to send the money back to the U.S. and hedge the currency risk. But for a big issuer like AT&T, unlocking new buyers in other currencies may be worth it, strategists say.Possible changes to the U.S. tax code could help keep the momentum going for these bonds. The idea of removing the tax deductibility of interest has been discussed, but was not included in a White House plan unveiled in April. If that happened, some U.S. companies might be pushed to issue more debt abroad to lessen that additional tax burden, Morningstar has said."
Wells Fargo,Equities: Broad Selling Spree Hits Retail Stocks --- Amazon deal news adds to pressure on traditional grocers and big-box operators," Jun 17, 2017",74.91,0,"Shares of retailers fell during a heavy day of trading after Amazon.com said it would buy Whole Foods Market, potentially squeezing their competitors.Grocers were already under pressure after Kroger, the biggest supermarket chain in the U.S. by sales, warned of disappointing earnings a day earlier.Retailers from traditional grocers to big-box operators tumbled Friday on fears that Amazon would do to them what it did to bookstores, stock analysts and fund managers said.""This is a shot across the bow,"" said Sean Lynch, co-head of global equities at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""The worry is that Amazon is going to impact the market, drive margins down.""The giant internet retailer's stock rose $23.54, or 2.4%, to $987.71 Friday, while Whole Foods shares jumped 9.62, or 29%, to 42.68.Rival grocers Supervalu and Kroger both tumbled, capping a brutal week for the industry. Kroger shares sank 19% Thursday after it said increasing competition would hurt earnings for the year. That competition isn't letting up: This past week, German grocery chain Lidl opened its first stores in the U.S.Big-box operators such as Wal-Mart Stores and Target fell roughly 5% on Friday.Food and staples companies in the S&P 500 shed 5.5% during the week, the group's worst weekly decline in nearly two yearsTechnology stocks also slipped, extending losses for a sector that has been under pressure lately.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 13.74 points, or 0.2%, to 6151.76 Friday, notching a 0.9% weekly loss.Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record, rising 24.38 points, or 0.1%, to 21384.28.The S&P 500 added 0.69 point, or less than 0.1%, to 2433.15. Whole Foods was the best-performing stock of the day in the broad index, while Kroger and Costco Wholesale led declines.It was the largest-volume day of 2017 for stock trading on major U.S. exchanges.Tech remains the best-performing S&P 500 sector in the index in 2017, up 17% year to date. But some recent sessions have been rough for the group. Declines in stocks including Apple and Google parent Alphabet have dragged the sector down 3.4% over the past two weeks -- its biggest such decline since Brexit.""Tech has done exceptionally well this year,"" said Yogi Dewan, chief executive at Hassium Asset Management, pointing to signs of solid revenue growth in the sector. ""But at these valuations, we're not putting new money into it.""Among the tech companies that fell in the past week: Snap, one of the most-anticipated initial public offerings in recent years. The parent of disappearing-message app Snapchat closed down at its $17 IPO price on Thursday and rose 54 cents, or 3.2%, to 17.54 Friday, losing 3% for the week.Medical-robotics maker Myomo ended its first week of trading up 5.45, or 61%, at 14.45. Myomo was the first company to list on a major U.S. exchange through a provision of federal law known as Reg A+, which was designed to help fund small-business growth.Despite the recent wobble in some of this year's best-performing stocks, both U.S. and global equities had their biggest weekly inflows this year in the week ended June 14, according to EPFR Global data.Mr. Dewan said pullbacks this year have been short and overall volatility has been low because of the high cash levels he has seen among investors, with many clients waiting for any drop in the market to add to their stockholdings.Fund managers surveyed by Bank of America increased cash in their portfolios in June, bringing their cash allocations well above the historical average.Energy stocks rose Friday as the price of oil rose slightly. U.S.-traded crude added 0.6%, to $44.74 a barrel Friday, but prices have fallen more than 11% over the past four weeks on oversupply concerns.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note eased to 2.157% Friday from 2.160% Thursday.

Wells Fargo,Citigroup Looks to Go on Offense --- CEO Corbat faces a growing consensus that now is the time for bank to shift tack," Jun 20, 2017",76.11,1,"Investors want Michael Corbat to change the narrative at Citigroup Inc. Since taking the bank's helm in October 2012, Mr. Corbat's Citigroup has played defense. It has scaled back businesses, shrunk the firm's global retail-banking footprint and wound down crisis-era assets that dragged on returns. For shareholders, it has been a slog. Citigroup's total return has underperformed those of its biggest rivals, save for Wells Fargo & Co., since Mr. Corbat arrived on the scene. The bank has yet to show it can consistently generate returns that exceed its cost of capital; in the first quarter the bank's return on common equity was a tepid 7.4%. And the stock trades at just 85% of book value, the lowest valuation of the big U.S. banks. Now, investors, analysts and even top executives within the bank say it is time for Mr. Corbat, a former Harvard football star, to shift to offense. That means boosting growth and profitability in areas such as credit cards, Wall Street stock trading and retail banking.""What investors want now is to understand what's next in the story,"" said Conor Muldoon, fundamental portfolio manager at Causeway Capital Management LLC. ""What can you do to make the valuation better over time?"" Citigroup is among the largest holdings in the firm's Global Value fund. The first test comes this week and next with the Federal Reserve's annual bank stress tests. A key indicator will be the bank's so-called payout ratio under the tests, a measure of whether it is given a green light to return more capital to shareholders than it is expected to earn in coming quarters. Citigroup shareholders want to see the payout ratio top 100%, meaning the bank would begin drawing down its capital pile rather than continue adding to it. If it can't do this, gains in its business won't accrue to shareholders. Assuming that won't be the case, investors want Mr. Corbat to boost returns over the long term by generating more profit on lagging businesses, notably the bank's consumer-lending and retail-banking arm. In anticipation of this, Mr. Corbat has been honing the bank's focus, a notable change for a firm that was once a sprawling global behemoth. He and his veteran management team have done things like exit nearly two dozen retail markets globally and slash the number of corporate clients to 14,000 from 30,000. The bank has already said it would invest a further $1 billion to upgrade its Mexican retail bank. The biggest recent bet, though, is on credit cards, particularly for U.S. shoppers. Over the past two years, Citigroup has taken on more than $10 billion in card loans for Costco Wholesale Corp. and made other investments, such as in Citigroup's proprietary reward-card offerings. Mr. Corbat and other executives are expected to provide greater detail for plans when the bank in July holds an investor day -- its first in nearly a decade. At this, he also will have to fight the view among some investors and analysts that Citigroup lacks a unifying strategy."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Warren Keeps Pressure on Wells --- Senator exhorts Fed to oust 12 directors who served during sales-practice scandal," Jun 20, 2017",74.11,0,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren is urging the Federal Reserve to remove a dozen Wells Fargo & Co. board directors who served during the bank's sales-practices scandal, according to a letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. In the letter sent to Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen on Monday, the Massachusetts Democrat urged the Fed to invoke its authority under a rule that allows it to remove certain people associated with depository institutions under specific circumstances. Sen. Warren pointed to 12 directors who served on the San Francisco bank's board between May 2011 and July 2015, a period in which Wells Fargo fired 5,300 employees for the bad behavior. The bank settled with two regulators and a city official in September for $185 million over the practices. Its chief executive later abruptly retired, and the bank continues to face state and federal investigations, with which it has said it is cooperating. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said the board and its management team have ""taken many actions in response to its retail-sales practices issues, including changes in senior leadership, executive accountability actions and numerous steps to ensure we make things right with any customer affected by unacceptable sales practices."" The bank's board has also endured harsh criticism and faced opposition during a shareholder meeting in April. Several directors were re-elected by just a slim margin. When former CEO John Stumpf appeared before the Senate Banking Committee to explain the problems, Sen. Warren lambasted him and said he should resign and be criminally investigated. In her eight-page letter to the Fed, Sen. Warren wrote that the sales-practices scandal ""revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices -- problems that justify the Federal Reserve's removal of all responsible Board members."" In the wake of the scandal, Wells Fargo's board conducted an investigation of the bank, but largely didn't fault with directors. Chairman Stephen Sanger in April said ""the findings of the investigation showed the board took the appropriate actions with the information it had, when it had it."" Sen. Warren's letter cited the Fed's ability to remove board members, including if they ""engaged or participated in any unsafe or unsound practice"" that caused certain depository institutions to ""suffer financial loss"" and that demonstrated ""continuing disregard . . . for the safety and soundness"" of the institution. The 12 board directors mentioned in the letter are: John D. Baker II, John S. Chen, Lloyd H. Dean, Elizabeth A. Duke, Enrique Hernandez Jr., Donald M. James, Cynthia H. Milligan, Federico F. Pena, James H. Quigley, Mr. Sanger, Susan G. Swenson and Suzanne M. Vautrinot."
Wells Fargo,What Could Go Wrong in Federal Reserve's Stress Tests," Jun 22, 2017",73.92,1,"Investors are looking forward to a stress-free round of bank stress tests this week. But there could be complications. The Federal Reserve will reveal on Thursday which of the 34 banks it tests have passed hypothetical negative scenarios while maintaining required capital levels. Then next week it will say whether it has approved their plans to return capital to shareholders, a higher bar. Last year, every bank subject to the test passed, and all but two got the nod for their capital payouts. Investors expect another positive outcome this year. Going into the tests, banks overall have higher capital levels and better earnings prospects than last year. Analysts figure that Citigroup and Morgan Stanley could be in a position for the first time to pay out more than 100% of their projected profits. Compared with last year, this year's test assumes a slightly more severe domestic recession. Notably, it features a sharper decline in commercial real-estate prices -- 35% versus 30% in last year's tests. Multifamily properties are assumed to suffer even bigger declines. This means regional lenders with big commercial real-estate portfolios are probably at greater risk of failing. In a report, analysts at Goldman Sachs Group pointed to Key Bank, M&T Bank and Zions Bancorp as having the highest ratios of commercial real-estate exposure to risk capital. For investors, the more important results will be next week when the Fed says how much capital banks can pay out. In an era of slow growth and low rates, bigger dividends and stock buybacks would be important drivers of bank shares. Even if these regional lenders do pass the first round of the stress tests, and that is likely, if their capital levels come close to regulatory minimums in the ugly scenarios, the banks may scale back their payout requests. That could hurt their stocks.Some investors are also concerned that Wells Fargo could have its return plan denied on ""qualitative"" grounds as part of the extended fallout from last year's account-sales fiasco. But Goldman's analysts figure this is unlikely given the amount of work the bank has done to reform its sales practices. The most likely scenario is still that banks will pass this year's tests easily. But these few names are the ones to watch for potential surprises."
Wells Fargo,"Apple, Banks Envy PayPal's Venmo Tool"," Jun 27, 2017",74.06,1,"Venmo has become a verb among people who want to send money digitally to each other. What it hasn't become is a huge moneymaker for parent PayPal Holdings Inc. Historically, that hasn't been much of a concern for PayPal, although that is starting to change. Making money might matter even less to the big tech and finance firms like Apple Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. that are going after Venmo's business. Those firms are trying to prevent Venmo from becoming to person-to-person payments what Google is to search or Facebook is to social media. The reason: Even if such services aren't profitable today, companies believe they are vital to getting and keeping consumers, especially coveted millennials. ""We don't charge customers,"" Gordon Smith, head of consumer banking at J.P. Morgan, said at an investor conference while describing the bank's efforts in person-to-person payments. ""So you all quite rightly will ask me, 'Well, what's the revenue model?' And the revenue model is that the customer is engaged on our banking app."" J.P. Morgan this month connected its smartphone apps to a new money-transfer network called Zelle which is owned by several banks and is expected to reach 86 million consumers. That followed an announcement from Apple that it was also getting into person-to-person payments. Behind the companies' zeal is rapid growth in digital person-to-person payments. Consumers made $147.1 billion in such transactions in 2016, up 47% from the year before, according to consulting firm Aite Group LLC. But Venmo won't be easily pushed aside. It is growing faster than the overall market, handling $17.6 billion in such payments in 2016, more than double its $7.5 billion in 2015. With these payment services, consumers link a bank account, debit card or credit card to a smartphone app and can send money to anyone else with just the email address or phone number of the recipient. Venmo and the other services typically eat the charges that banks or card networks impose on transfers that move over their payment rails. ""It's been all cost and no revenue, but a tremendous acquisition tool and a tremendous engagement tool,"" PayPal Chief Executive Dan Schulman told a separate investor conference last month. He added that the typical user opens Venmo two or three times a week. Venmo was an afterthought for PayPal when it acquired the service as part of a roughly $800 million deal for Braintree Payments Solutions LLC in 2013. Braintree's primary business was enabling tech companies like Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc. to accept online and mobile payments. Braintree had paid around $26 million for Venmo in 2012. Users liked that Venmo didn't require the sender and recipient to belong to the same bank, a stipulation that doomed earlier payments services. Another feature within the app displayed transactions of friends and relatives in a news feed, which proved to be a hit with college students and recent graduates used to sharing minutiae on social networks. Starting this quarter, PayPal plans to ramp up its effort to make money from Venmo by trying to persuade merchants to accept it as a form of payment -- and charging them a typical fee of 2.9% plus $0.30. Early adopters include online fashion marketplace Poshmark Inc., online bulk retailer Boxed.com and hamburger chain White Castle Management Co. ""People really value [person-to-person payments], but there's so much more they want to a digital commerce experience,"" Bill Ready, PayPal's chief operating officer, said in an interview. Apple is also angling to use person-to-person payments to boost usage of Apple Pay, which was launched in 2014. The goal: Apple keeps a slice of the transaction fee charged to merchants when its users tap their iPhones to pay for goods and services in stores, online and in smartphone apps. Funds that an iPhone user receives will be stored on a virtual card issued by Green Dot Corp., that can be used to shop with Apple Pay. Rather than building a distinct smartphone app, Apple is integrating its money-transfer service with its iMessage and Siri products later this year. (Venmo also works with iMessage and Siri.) So far, Apple Pay's overall progress has been slow; only 13% of the estimated 680 million iPhone users have activated the service, according to Loup Ventures, a venture-capital firm specializing in tech research. Person-to-person payments could spur more sign-ups, but because it works through iMessage, the service's user base is limited to people who have newer iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. ""The big disadvantage of the Apple product is it's Apple only,"" said Craig Maurer, an analyst at Autonomous Research. With Zelle, banks are trying to be as inclusive as possible. The seven banks that own Early Warning Systems LLC, the entity that owns the Zelle network, have the largest U.S. customer bases. The member banks, which include J.P. Morgan, Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co., plan to integrate Zelle within their own smartphone apps. Unlike with Venmo and Apple Pay, customers using Zelle won't have to initiate separate transfers to get money they received into their bank account. Customers of other banks can access Zelle through a stand-alone app, but that isn't due to launch until later this year. Those transfers won't run on Zelle, but through Visa's and Mastercard's real-time payments networks."
Wells Fargo,U.S. News: Berkshire Poised to Be BofA's Top Holder," Jun 29, 2017",74.42,1,"Warren Buffett's firm is on track to become the biggest shareholder in Bank of America Corp.The Charlotte, N.C., bank, the second-largest in the country by assets, received permission from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday to boost its per-share dividend to 48 cents a year. Mr. Buffett has said a dividend of this size would prompt his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to swap its preferred shares in the bank into about $17 billion worth of common stock.The move would make the famous stockpicker's firm the largest shareholder of the second- and third-largest U.S. banks -- the third being Wells Fargo & Co. -- while also providing a vote of confidence for Bank of America stock.On Wednesday, as part of the ""stress test"" process, the Fed approved Bank of America's plan to pay out the 48-cent dividend, a 60% increase from the current 30-cent level. The regulator also approved the bank's plans to buy back $12.9 billion worth of shares. Over the past year, the bank got permission to buy back $7.7 billion worth of shares.In February, Mr. Buffett said in his annual letter to shareholders that Berkshire planned to make the switch in its Bank of America stake if the bank could increase its annual dividend to 44 cents a share from its recent level of 30 cents a share. That is because a common-stock dividend of 44 cents would pay Berkshire more than the $300 million that the preferred stake gives the firm annually.Berkshire bought its preferred shares in the bank in 2011, when the lender sorely needed to shore up investor sentiment. The $5 billion deal also included warrants to buy 700 million shares of Bank of America common stock for $7.14 apiece, far below the current price.The preferred shares have little downside, so long as Bank of America stays solvent. But they have no upside either. With a change in Berkshire's shares, Mr. Buffett effectively would be saying that he would like to take part in possible gains on Bank of America's stock while still enjoying a steady dividend.After an exchange, Mr. Buffett's firm would own about 7% of the bank's common shares, giving it a significant role in corporate-governance issues from compensation to the election of new directors. Currently, the largest shareholder of Bank of America is Vanguard Group with a 6.6% stake, according to FactSet.Before his February letter, Mr. Buffett had said he would wait to exercise the warrants, which expire in 2021.It isn't clear when exactly a Berkshire exchange could happen now that the dividend increase has been approved. Mr. Buffett couldn't be reached to comment.Big banks need approval from the Fed to increase their dividends, a process that culminated in Wednesday's annual review of how the lenders would perform under severely stressed economic conditions. This is the second year in a row that Bank of America has gotten permission to increase both its dividend and buybacks. In the early years of the test, the bank struggled to get a clean approval for such capital-return increases from the regulator.The dividend and buyback boosts are positive for Bank of America Chairman and Chief Executive Brian Moynihan. The 57-year-old lawyer has worked to restore the bank's relationships with shareholders after years of large mortgage fines and losses stemming from the bank's crisis-era purchases of Countrywide and Merrill Lynch.When Berkshire bought the preferred shares in 2011, Bank of America was slumping, losing confidence among many investors. Mr. Buffett helped to change that narrative by agreeing to purchase $5 billion in preferred stock and calling the bank ""well led,"" an important endorsement for Mr. Moynihan more than a year after he had risen to the CEO role.The terms though were expensive for Bank of America. The preferred stock paid a chunky 6% annual dividend, or $300 million a year. Bank of America shares have tripled since the investment, from about $7.60 to $23.88, giving Berkshire a paper gain of almost $12 billion. The Omaha, Neb., investor also has made about $1.7 billion in dividends on the preferred shares.Mr. Buffett, Berkshire's chairman and CEO, amassed stakes in a number of lenders and financial-services companies, sometimes at cut-rate prices around the financial crisis. Berkshire's other bank holdings as of March 31 included Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon Corp., American Express Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., M&T Bank Corp. and U.S. Bancorp."
Wells Fargo,"Equities: Stocks Spurred by Tech, Banks"," Jun 29, 2017",73.68,0,"The Nasdaq Composite posted its biggest jump since November, as rallying technology and bank shares led broad gains in U.S. stocks.It was a turnaround from the previous session, when major U.S. stock indexes posted their biggest daily declines in weeks.Some traders and analysts said the pullback allowed investors to snap up stocks that have been rising this year with help from solid corporate earnings. Recent declines in the U.S. stock market have been relatively short-lived; the S&P 500 is up 9% so far this year, on track for its best first half since 2013.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 143.95 points, or 0.7%, to 21454.61 on Wednesday. Gains in J.P.

Baird & Co.Technology shares, up almost 19% this year in the S&P 500, were back among the market's best performers Wednesday, rising 1.3%. Some investors' concerns that the sector had grown too popular has contributed to the sector's 0.8% decline in June.""Everybody remembers the [year] 2000 slipping of the tech sector,"" said Jae Yoon, chief investment officer at New York Life Investment Management. ""But I have no concerns about tech valuations,"" he said, noting that in terms of price/earnings metrics, the sector is trading much closer in line with the S&P 500 than it did at its peak.On Wednesday, highflying tech stocks such as Apple, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon.com and Facebook each gained at least 1%. Semiconductor company Nvidia rose $5.17, or 3.5%, to $151.75.U.S. crude-oil prices rose for a fifth straight session, up 1.1% to $44.74 a barrel, supporting commodity-linked shares.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 rose 1.6%, with Bank of America adding 61 cents, or 2.6%, to $23.88. The bank was expected to get a stress-test result from the Federal Reserve that would let it raise its dividend, an outcome that was confirmed after the stock market closed, when all 34 firms tested by the Fed got approval for their capital-return plans. Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan each rose more than 2%.Reports that investors might have overestimated the European Central Bank's readiness to reel in its stimulus program ""got [Wednesday's] rally going,"" said Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading Institutional Services.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.223% from 2.198% Tuesday. Yields rise as bond prices fall. Rising long-term bond yields, which tend to boost lending profitability, have supported bank stocks in recent sessions.Early Thursday, Hong Kong Hang Seng Index was up 0.8% and Australia's S&P ASX 200 was up 0.7%."
Wells Fargo,U.S. News: Breaking Down the New Dividends and Buybacks," Jun 29, 2017",73.66,1,"The largest U.S. banks all said they would increase their dividends and share buybacks, a move cheered by investors that followed the banks receiving passing grades on the Federal Reserve's stress tests Wednesday. Here is how the new dividends and buybacks break down at the biggest banks: Bank of America Corp. boosted its quarterly dividend 60% to 12 cents a share from the current 7.5 cents.The bank also plans to buy back $12.9 billion worth of shares over a four-quarter period versus $7.7 billion in the previous period.Warren Buffett has said a dividend of this size would prompt his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to swap its preferred shares in the bank into about $17 billion worth of common stock.Citigroup Inc. is increasing its quarterly dividend to 32 cents a share from16 cents.It also plans to buy back $15.6 billion compared with $10.4billion in its buyback plan last year.The bank's capital return plan of $18.9 billion over the next four quarters is above the $15 billion to $18 billion that Citigroup said it needed to achieve to be credible with shareholders hoping for a solid return.J.P.

Wells Fargo,"Banks Boost Payouts After Passing Tests --- In turning point for industry, Fed sanctions large increase in dividends, buybacks"," Jun 29, 2017",75.49,1,"Big U.S. banks plan to increase dividend payouts and share buybacks to their highest levels in years after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved capital plans for all 34 firms taking part in its annual stress tests.The approvals -- the first time since the annual tests began in 2011 that all firms got passing grades -- reflect a turning point for big financial institutions that have been shackled by tighter regulation since the financial crisis. They could also herald a return to precrisis days when banks were reliable dividend payers and shareholders flocked to them.Bank of America Corp., for example, said that it would increase its dividend by 60% to 12 cents a share per quarter, putting it above a threshold where Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. may convert a stake in the firm into common stock and become the bank's largest shareholder. The second-biggest U.S. bank by assets also said it received approval to repurchase up to $12.9 billion of its shares, far above the $7.7 billion it bought back over the previous year.On average, the group of firms taking part in the stress tests requested payouts that are near 100% of their expected earnings over the next year, up from 65% last year, senior Fed officials said. That means banks in some cases will be able to start whittling away at capital buffers that many bank executives say are well in excess of what is needed to absorb potential losses.Such moves signal an easing of the Fed's hardline stance toward banks since the crisis and could provide a durable pillar of support for higher bank stock prices. Those soared following President Donald Trump's election but largely have treaded water so far in 2017 amid lackluster economic indicators, political defeats for the White House and a flattening yield curve that threatens to weigh on bank profits.The KBW Nasdaq Bank index is up 2.8% year to date versus an 8.9% gain for the S&P 500. That said, bank stocks are still well ahead of the broader market when measured from November's election. Big-bank shares rose in many cases more than 1% in after-hours trading Wednesday, while some, like Citigroup Inc., were up more than 2%.The payouts announced by banks Wednesday were in many cases above investor expectations. Citigroup, for instance, said it planned to return $18.9 billion to shareholders over the coming four quarters. That is equal to 132% of what Wall Street analysts expect the bank to earn over the same period. Analysts had expected the bank's payout ratio would be around 110%.Morgan Stanley and Alabama-based Regions Financial Corp. were also among those that were approved for payout ratios in excess of 100%, according to FactSet estimates and Wall Street Journal reviews of corporate filings.""The absolute minimum is there won't be increased capital in these businesses,"" Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman said earlier this month. ""There shouldn't be and there won't be.""Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and State Street Corp. cleared one of the Fed's yardsticks by just tenths of a percentage point, suggesting they have gotten more adept at figuring out how to squeak through the tests.The latest result was the second part of the Fed's test results. In the first leg, released last week, the Fed said all big U.S. banks were able to survive a hypothetical recession.Fed governor Jerome Powell said the stress-test process, now in its seventh year, ""has motivated all of the largest banks to achieve healthy capital levels.""Born of the financial meltdown, the stress tests have come to command bankers' and investors' attention. Executives manage with the tests in mind and have collectively spent billions of dollars to develop risk-management systems to meet the Fed's expectations.This year's passing grades suggest that those efforts have paid off. Banks today are better capitalized and more conservatively managed than before the financial crisis and have better insight into risks lurking in their own books.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the nation's biggest bank by assets, was approved for a 12% increase to its dividend and a $19.4 billion buyback program. CEO James Dimon said the bank was ""pleased to further increase capital returns to our shareholders while continuing to invest in our businesses.""In a nod to progress at banks, the Fed has made changes to the exams. This year, only 13 of the biggest, most complex banks faced a qualitative exam of their risk-management abilities. Others, such as the U.S. arm of Spain's Banco Santander SA, had to pass only a numerical assessment.The results had some banks breathing sighs of relief. At Santander, the U.S. chief executive said he planned to hold a champagne toast in the boardroom after the Fed approved its capital plan. The bank had failed the tests the previous three years.Wells Fargo & Co.'s approval, too, is a sorely needed win for the bank, which has been in the spotlight for months over a sales-practices scandal. Some analysts had predicted that the Fed might flunk Wells Fargo on ""qualitative"" grounds even if it passed the numerical part of the exam.Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said this spring that the bank was ""very self-aware"" of that risk and that it had ""sized our [capital-return] ask appropriately.""The Fed said the largest and most complex firms, however, still have work to do in maintaining accurate data and identifying risks in new products.One spot hit hard this year was credit cards. Credit-card defaults are rising after years in record-low territory and were a chief focus of Fed officials who designed this year's tests. Last week's results forecast $100 billion of credit-card losses in a severe downturn across the industry.Two of the largest stand-alone card issuers, Capital One Financial Corp. and American Express Co., revised their payout requests downward after receiving the results of the stress test's first part last week."
Wells Fargo,Bank Stocks Rally on Higher Dividends," Jun 30, 2017",76.38,1,"Bank stocks rallied Thursday after strong stress-test results led many lenders to increase dividends and share buybacks. The surge came on a day when the market overall slumped on falling technology shares.The green light from the Federal Reserve for big banks to return loftier levels of capital led investors to put aside for the moment worries about the future direction of long-term interest rates or policy ructions in Washington.Instead, they were salivating over the prospect of higher dividend yields at banks.""The capital return tide has turned,"" Morgan Stanley bank analyst Betsy Graseck wrote in a note to investors Thursday. ""Yield investors will have to start paying more attention to bank stocks, expanding the investor base.""Consider that Bank of America Corp. shares were yielding about 1.26% Wednesday, based on the bank's prior annual dividend payout of 30 cents a share. The bank said Wednesday, following the release of the stress-test results, that it would jack the annual dividend up to 48 cents a share.That would push the prospective dividend yield to around 2%, even taking into account the increase in Bank of America's stock Thursday. The shares rose 1.8%.While yields on U.S. Treasury securities have risen in recent days, such dividend-yield increases put some bank-stock payouts more in line with longer-dated government bonds. The five-year U.S. Treasury note, for example, yielded 1.85% in Thursday trading.Shares of other big banks, such as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co. and Citigroup Inc., also rose Thursday. Those banks, too, had announced increased dividends the evening before. Sweetening the pot, banks also announced sizable increases in their expected share buybacks over the coming year.Overall, banks increased their payouts more than analysts had expected. Ms. Graseck noted that dividends could continue to increase, forecasting a median 11% increase in 2018 for stress-test banks following a 12% increase this year.Reflecting the upbeat sentiment, the KBW Nasdaq Bank index rose more than 1% Thursday even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 167.58 points, or 0.8%.Michael Levine, manager of the OppenheimerFunds $4 billion Equity Income fund, said he remains optimistic on banks in part because of likely dividend growth, especially at Citigroup, one of the fund's biggest holdings.He sees the dividends as a sign of tangible progress for banks.Between the November election and the end of 2016, the KBW index rose 23%. That was largely due to investor hopes for higher economic growth that would lead to higher interest rates, and so bank profits, as well as a reduction in bank regulation and an overhaul of the U.S. tax code.While the Fed has raised short-term rates and there have been some signs of regulatory relief, investors' hopes have yet to be fully realized. A rise in longer-term rates in recent days, for example, hadn't brought much relief to banks. The difference in yields between the 10-year and two-year Treasury was just 0.90 percentage point, a low level that can signal a squeeze on bank profits.Given that, capital returns become even more important. ""We don't think rates are going to skyrocket, and regulatory change has become more vulnerable,"" Mr. Levine said. ""But you're still going to have relatively attractive dividend growth.""Even with Wednesday's announced dividend increases, yields often remain below pre-financial crisis payout levels. Shares in Bank of America, for instance, had an average yield of 3.36% from June 1997 to June 2007, according to FactSet.One unknown, though, is how consistent growth will be in coming years for capital returns. That depends on the Federal Reserve.Before the financial crisis, bank boards decided on dividend or buyback increases. Now, though, the banks must go through annual stress tests and the Fed must sign off on their capital plans.Not everyone was joining the bank-stock celebration. Terry McEvoy, a bank analyst at Stephens Inc., remained more focused on whether looser regulation and tax changes will materialize. He said he believes those are necessary for bank shares to advance further.Meanwhile, Citigroup bank analyst Keith Horowitz wrote Thursday that the only development was a change in the timeline for when capital would be returned.Because investors knew the capital would eventually be returned, the announcement had little impact on his valuation estimates."
Wells Fargo,"To Finance Deal, Sycamore Takes Knife to Staples"," Jun 30, 2017",77.65,1,"Sycamore Partners intends to split Staples Inc. into three parts to help fund its $6.9 billion purchase of the office-supply seller, in another sign of the challenges facing the retail industry.The three separately financed entities -- U.S. retail, Canadian retail and corporate supply -- will remain under the same corporate umbrella, according to people familiar with the plan.The approach is intended to make Sycamore's leveraged buyout of Staples, announced Wednesday, an easier sell to bond and loan investors whose appetite for retail names has soured as the industry's prospects have waned. Their participation will be crucial to financing what is the largest leverage buyout announced this year.UBS Group AG, Bank of America Corp. and other Wall Street banks plan to arrange bonds and loans backing only the Staples unit that distributes paper, pens and other supplies to large business and government customers, the people said. That business, Staples' largest, is seen as its crown jewel.Sycamore plans to fund its purchase of the Canadian retail business in part with debt from asset manager KKR & Co., the people said. Wells Fargo & Co. will finance the U.S. retail segment with a loan backed by the chain's assets, they said.Loans from Wells Fargo will also go toward financing the other two units, some of the people said.Sycamore's approach to the deal is similar to the firm's play for another beleaguered retailer, Jones Group Inc., in 2014. After Sycamore bought the apparel company it created four independent operating entities: Nine West, Jones New York, Kasper Group and a jeans company. It also took two Jones brands -- Stuart Weitzman and Kurt Geiger -- and made them into other independent companies; both were later sold."
Wells Fargo,U.S. News: Weak Inflation Poses Fresh Test for the Fed," Jul 1, 2017",77.08,1,"WASHINGTON -- Inflation eased for the third consecutive month and consumer spending was tepid in May, potential complications for the Federal Reserve as it charts a course for interest rates.The Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the price index for personal-consumption expenditures, rose 1.4% in May from a year earlier, the lowest level in six months, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding the often-volatile categories of food and energy, so-called core prices were also up 1.4%, the lowest level since December 2015.The Fed, tasked with promoting full employment and stable prices, targets a 2% annual inflation rate. The price index poked above that threshold in February for the first time in nearly five years but has settled lower each month since.""Although the real economy is doing well, Fed officials are concerned that isn't translating into stronger inflationary pressures,"" Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.Despite soft readings, the Fed's policy-making committee earlier this month decided to raise its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point and penciled in one more increase for later this year.Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said the weak inflation numbers largely reflect temporary factors, such as falling prices on cellphone plans, and smaller-than-normal rises for drug prices.""With employment near its maximum sustainable level and the labor market continuing to strengthen, the committee still expects inflation to move up and stabilize around 2% over the next couple of years,"" Ms. Yellen said.Outside of inflation, the economy appears to be advancing at a steady if unspectacular pace.Personal-consumption expenditures, a measure of household spending on everything from new cars to medical care, increased a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in May from the prior month, the Commerce report said. The measure had risen 0.4% the prior two months.Instead of splashing out, Americans saved more, boosting the personal-saving rate to 5.5%, its highest level in eight months.""Americans are in good shape to increase consumption -- the question is when?"" Eugenio Aleman, senior economist at Wells Fargo, said in a note to clients"
Wells Fargo,"For Phones, an ATM Role --- Fingerprints stored on mobile devices give users access to cash; limiting hack dangers"," Jul 10, 2017",76.27,1,"In 2015, Citigroup Inc. began testing an ATM that would scan a customer's iris and make four-digit access codes obsolete. Two years on, Citi has shelved the project.Among the reasons: the cost and complexity of collecting and managing millions of customers' biometric data. A large database of biometric data is also a particularly juicy target for hackers.""If I steal your password, you make a new password,"" said George Avetisov, chief executive of HYPR Corp., a banking-technology startup. ""But how do you make a new fingerprint?""Perhaps as a response to that issue, banks are taking a different tack on collecting biometric data. They aim to use the information to replace personal-identification numbers and passwords but are relying on customers to store and safeguard it themselves -- via their own smartphones.Over the past year, lenders such as Wells Fargo & Co., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. have started to roll out automated teller machines that can link to customers' mobile devices. Customers will sign in through their phones, potentially using a fingerprint, and transmit a code to the ATM.Though this adds a step to the identification process, customers are nonetheless eager to ditch the numerous PINs and passwords needed for transactions. Mobile phones are also one device on which biometrics has worked, as about two billion units globally can use fingerprints, pictures of eyes and faces, and voice recognition, according to HYPR. Those tools are already widely used for signing in to mobile-banking applications.Citigroup's apps, for example, use voice, face and fingerprint recognition, although the bank has yet to roll out cardless ATMs. As for the iris-reading ATMs, Citigroup has ""reasons ranging from logistical to operational"" for not pursuing them at this time, a spokesman said.Other banks have shared similar difficulties with how to approach biometric data. A survey by the U.K.'s University of Oxford and Mastercard Inc. published in June found that while nine out of 10 bankers wanted to take advantage of biometrics, only about a third reported a good experience so far using the technology.An added complication is that, unlike some other countries, the U.S. doesn't have national identification databases. In countries such as Chile, which does have such a database, banks could tap into it to enable customers to sign into an ATM with a fingerprint. So, banks in the U.S. are on their own to figure out how to record and store customers' biometric markers. That process adds complexity and cost.The need for next-generation ATMs is urgent. For one, card fraud is rising despite new security measures such as chip-enabled cards. Fair Isaac Corp., a credit-data provider, has said it detected a 70% uptick in compromised cards being used at ATMs and merchants in 2016.Though ATMs -- introduced 50 years ago -- might seem quaint in the mobile age, their usage remains strong. Last year, J.P. Morgan increased the number of ATMs it owns by 4%, even as it closed 3% of its branches. In January, Citigroup nearly doubled the size of its ATM network with a deal to add 30,000 locations at retailers.In their quest to use smartphones for biometrics, banks are relying on processes that are already well established. A customer using a phone at an ATM would authenticate her identify, using, say, a fingerprint as is the case with Apple Inc.'s iPhone and Apple Pay.The phone would then create a digital token and transmit that to the ATM. That would validate the transaction without revealing any underlying biometric data to the bank. That means banks wouldn't have to protect treasure troves of genetic templates from hackers. This is because the biometric data would be stored on individual devices, not in a central location.""With tokens, there's no use in attacking the bank server,"" said HYPR's Mr. Avetisov. Such digital tokens are widely used in mobile-payment applications and they are also generated by the chips now embedded in most credit cards."

The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which she will head, will be central to that effort.Within days of taking office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at trimming federal regulations and slowing the approval of new ones. In March, the president took steps to reverse Obama-era rules aimed at pushing U.S. utilities to shift from coal to cleaner-burning fuels. And his administration has outlined a series of moves to roll back provisions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul.Ms. Rao declined to comment while the Senate was considering her confirmation."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Home-Price Rise Eases Bank Pain on Equity Credit Lines," Jul 12, 2017",76.46,1,"Rising home prices have turned the great home-equity-line reset into a small setback rather than a disaster for the banking industry.Banks let home-equity lines of credit, or Helocs, flow freely in the run-up to the financial crisis, often to borrowers with bad credit or living in overvalued homes. Typically, the borrowers were allowed to pay back only the interest for 10 years.In recent years, banks worried that those borrowers wouldn't be able to keep up when the lines reset, which can raise monthly payments by hundreds of dollars.Now, more than halfway through the problem resets, banks are more optimistic. Borrowers with Helocs taken out in early 2007 are falling behind at lower rates than the Helocs that reset over the past three years, according to data provided to The Wall Street Journal by credit-reporting firm Equifax.About 3.8% of borrowers who signed up for Helocs in early 2007 were a month or more late on their payments four months after the lines reset, according to Equifax. That delinquency rate had been above 4% for each of the past threeyears, moving as high as 4.43% for loans made in 2004.What's changed: The economy and jobs picture have improved, and the housing market has recovered enough in recent years to give borrowers more flexibility.Specifically, it has become less common for mortgage borrowers to owe more than their house is worth, a condition known as being ""underwater"" that makes it harder for Heloc borrowers to handle a reset.In the first quarter, 9.7% of U.S. properties with a mortgage were seriously underwater, according to research firm Attom Data Solutions. In early 2014, that proportion was 17.5%. The firm defines seriously underwater as loans where the borrower owes at least 25% more than what the home is worth.Also, big lenders including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. say they have reached out to customers whose Helocs were about to reset, offering options the borrowers can afford. That can include taking out another loan to pay off the Heloc before it resets or applying for a new Heloc to keep the interest-only payments, both of which can allow a bank to mark a Heloc as ""positively"" closed.Equifax estimates that nearly 16% of the 2007 Helocs had been positively closed in recent months by the time they were about to reset. Four months after the reset,more than 24% had been positively closed.""It's really just sitting down with customers and assessing their needs and offering them good options,"" said Pete Boomer, head of mortgage production at PNC Financial Services Group Inc., which set up a task force for customers with resetting Helocs.The overall economy has helped, too. Since problem Helocs began resetting around early 2014, housing prices have risen, making it easier for banks to refinance customers into new loans. U.S. home prices, after dropping throughout the 2008 crisis and its aftermath, have risen nearly 35% since the start of 2014. The median sales price of an existing home was $252,800 in May 2017, according to the National Association of Realtors, up from $187,900 in January 2014.Unemployment has also fallen, making banks more comfortable with extending credit. ""At the end of the day, lenders do want to have Helocs on their books,"" said Guy Cecala, publisher of the trade publication Inside Mortgage Finance. ""They like the income on them -- they just want to make sure they're all in order."""
Wells Fargo,The Favorites to Win in Second-Quarter Bank Earnings," Jul 13, 2017",76.82,1,"Following the recent rally in bank stocks, the coming earnings season offers an opportunity to sort out who can keep rising, and who is due for a pause. Higher interest rates and higher capital payouts have boosted bank shares across the board. From the end of May through Tuesday, the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index had risen 8.5%. But other aspects of the banking business have been less positive. Loan growth, trading volumes and mergers and acquisition activity were all tepid in the second quarter. J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial will kick off second-quarter earnings on Friday, with other major financial firms reporting next week. The big universal banks look better positioned than both regional lenders and Wall Street brokers. The lending slowdown that began late last year hasn't abated. At the end of June, total loans and leases by commercial banks in the U.S. were up just 3.3% from a year earlier, compared with 6.4% for all of 2016, according to Federal Reserve data. Commercial and industrial loans were up just 1.9% at the end of June. In the first quarter, this trend hit regional banks hardest, along with Wells Fargo, whose business profile is similar to a regional lender. Executives at multiple banks also publicly warned during the quarter that trading volumes were down around 15% from a year earlier. A late-quarter bump up in rates could boost profits in the second or, more likely, third quarter for big universal banks with strong footprints in so-called macro products like interest rates and currencies, says UBS analyst Brennan Hawken. In the U.S., that would be J.P. Morgan and Citigroup. Goldman Sachs's trading results could disappoint yet again because of its large exposure to commodities, Mr. Hawken notes. Last quarter, its trading revenue was basically flat, compared with double-digit increases for its rivals. Among other factors, Goldman blamed low oil-market volatility. Unfortunately for Goldman, this continued in the second quarter. The firm's own analysts said recently that commodity volatility was down by around one-third in the second quarter. Goldman and Morgan Stanley are most exposed to weak M&A. Total world-wide revenue from realized M&A deals was down 9.2% from last year's second quarter, according to Dealogic. Rising interest rates and more flexibility to pay out capital are powerful levers that could keep pushing the whole sector higher. The biggest gains, though, will likely come from the biggest banks."
Wells Fargo,Plaintiffs Ramp Up 401(k) Lawsuits," Jul 14, 2017",77.08,1,"As 401(k) fee lawsuits have proliferated over the past year, a wider array of retirement-industry practices have come under fire. Now, the results are starting to come in, with some big settlements, and losses, for plaintiffs.Many of the recent cases involve firms that furnish 401(k) plans with their own investments or allegedly profit from the retirement-plan arrangements. Several suits have been filed by plaintiffs' firms that are relatively new to 401(k) litigation.""The plaintiffs' bar has definitely gotten more aggressive,"" said Susan Mangiero, an economist and managing director of Fiduciary Leadership LLC in Trumbull, Conn., who serves as an expert witness in 401(k) cases. ""New competitors see it as a very big business. The allegations have expanded in scope.""Fueling the litigation boom, observers said, is a handful of multimillion-dollar settlements by companies such as American Airlines Group Inc. -- which disclosed a $22 million settlement this month -- as well as a 2015 Supreme Court victory for plaintiffs in Tibble v. Edison, which put retirement plans on notice that they have a duty to monitor plan investments, including fees.Since 2006, plaintiffs' firms have filed more than 90 lawsuits against employers and other parties alleging excessive fees in 401(k)-style retirement plans, according to Groom Law Group in Washington.Last year alone, firms representing 401(k) participants filed more than 25 such cases, a record annual number.Many of the latest suits target companies, including a number of financial-services firms, for using their own investments in retirement plans. The suits allege that by selecting proprietary mutual funds, the companies acted in their own interests, rather than exclusively in the interests of the employees in their 401(k) plans.American Airlines settled allegations that it had breached its fiduciary duty by offering high-cost mutual funds from an affiliated investment company called American Beacon Advisors Inc., an arrangement that plaintiffs said allowed American to profit at the expense of its 401(k) participants. American has since removed the American Beacon funds from its 401(k) plan. The airline admitted no wrongdoing in its settlement.In other decisions, defendants have prevailed. Last month, Judge William G. Young of the U.S. District Court in Boston dismissed a suit against Putnam Investments following a trial.While Putnam's ""review of the Plan lineup was no paragon of diligence,"" the judge wrote, the plaintiffs ""failed to point to specific circumstances in which"" Putnam put its own interests ahead of its 401(k) participants.Stephen Rosenberg, a partner at the Wagner Law Group, which specializes in retirement plans, said the ""plaintiffs may have been thinking that it was enough to show that using Putnam funds was good for Putnam. But the judge said, 'You have to prove Putnam deliberately put itself ahead of its 401(k) participants.' """"This is just one District Court judge's interpretation,"" Mr. Rosenberg said. But ""it's going to create a standard that everybody is going to have to deal with."" Plaintiffs' attorney Carl Engstrom, at Nichols Kaster in Minneapolis, said the plaintiffs plan to appeal.The decision follows the dismissal of a similar case against Wells Fargo & Co. in May. In that case, the plaintiffs alleged that Wells Fargo breached its fiduciary duty by using its own target-date funds, rather than cheaper alternatives from Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group.The plaintiff recently filed an appeal. Wells Fargo said it expects the ruling to be upheld on appeal.Minnesota District Judge David S. Doty called into question the widespread practice among plaintiffs' firms of comparing the fees and performance of proprietary funds, such as the ones at issue in the Wells Fargo case, with Vanguard funds."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp;amp; Markets: Rising Rates Bolster Wells," Jul 15, 2017",76.71,1,"Wells Fargo & Co. reaped the benefits of higher interest rates in the second quarter, which helped push profit at the nation's third-largest bank up by 4.5%. The San Francisco-based bank's shares fell 1.1% on Friday, however, as stagnant lending, weaker revenue in areas like mortgage banking and higher costs overshadowed progress on the bottom line. Shares in Wells Fargo and other big banks had been on a tear since the U.S. presidential election, as investors wagered that the Trump administration would take a more cordial approach to regulating Wall Street and fostering growth. But with little change to either the economic outlook and policy toward banks, it is unclear when banks' earnings potential will catch up to their higher valuations. ""Much of [the run-up in stocks] was probably aggressive or not fully warranted,"" said John Shrewsberry, Wells Fargo's finance chief, in an interview. ""The realized outcome doesn't look any different than the realized outcome a year ago. So I think markets have to grapple with what does that actually mean."" Wells Fargo reported a profit of $5.81 billion, or $1.07 a share. That compares with $5.56 billion, or $1.01 a share, in the same period of 2016. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected earnings of $1.01 a share. The bank's results included a $186 million tax benefit during the second quarter, most of which was related to a deal it reached in June to sell its commercial insurance business. That boosted Wells Fargo's per-share earnings by 4 cents. Excluding this, the company's earnings would have come in at $1.03. Net interest income at the bank rose 6.4%, to $12.48 billion, from the same period last year. The rates Wells Fargo charges customers to borrow on credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other loan types vary along with the Federal Reserve's target, so the central bank's policy moves in recent months have directly improved banks' lending income. The bank's net interest margin, a measure of how profitably it can lend out its customers' deposits, rose to 2.9% from 2.86% last June, and its return on equity rose to 11.95% from 11.7%. The bank said it exercised discipline in repricing deposits, which helped them capture more of an increase in loan yields. The overall size of Wells Fargo's loan book stalled at $957 billion. During the quarter, the bank backed off making certain car loans and commercial-real-estate loans due to higher risk in those segments, executives said on a conference call with analysts. Wells Fargo's income from fees fell 7% to $9.69 billion, with several of its businesses facing challenges in the quarter. Mortgage-banking fee income fell 19% due in part to tougher competition, and net gains on the bank's trading activities fell 46% due in part to trading losses. The bank, led by Chief Executive Timothy Sloan, had been one of the most consistent big banks at growing earnings and revenue. Shares have underperformed those of other banks after Wells Fargo last year agreed to a $185 million settlement with two regulators and a city official over opening as many as 2.1 million accounts with fictitious or unauthorized information. It also continues to face a spate of state and federal investigations that the bank has said it is cooperating with. About $110 million in additional charges related to remedying Wells Fargo's operations following the sales-practice scandal contributed to a 5.2% increase in expenses, which totaled $13.54 billion in the quarter."
Wells Fargo,"Market Soars as Economy Plods --- Indicators point to continuing expansion, but pace is modest in light of share run-up"," Jul 15, 2017",75.18,1,"Surging optimism in financial markets hasn't translated into a big pickup in economic growth.Stocks hit records Friday and big U.S. banks reported stronger-than-expected earnings. But new government data showed consumers pulled back spending at midyear even as markets rallied. Households also grew less optimistic about the future and inflation on consumer purchases softened.Taken together, the indicators pointed to an economy that is entering the ninth year of expansion steady and still creating jobs at a healthy clip, but without obvious additional momentum. President Donald Trump has set out an agenda to push economic growth well beyond the roughly 2% pace that has prevailed since the recession ended in 2009, but so far there is little sign of a real breakout happening.Rising stocks could point to an upturn down the road, or conversely a risk that investors could soon get tripped up.Modest price pressures are a possible sign of slower underlying economic momentum and a headache for the Federal Reserve, which has struggled to reach its 2% annual inflation goal since the 2007-09 recession.""To be sure, the data do not suggest an impending recession,"" said Richard Curtin, chief economist for the University of Michigan's consumer-sentiment survey. ""Rather, the data indicate that hopes for a prolonged period of 3% GDP growth sparked by Trump's victory have largely vanished, aside from a temporary snapback expected in the second quarter.""The president has suggested a number of policies to spur growth, including a tax overhaul and major infrastructure spending, but those aren't yet close to reality.On the positive side, factory output picked up in June, and domestic energy production is rebounding. Overall economic activity appeared to accelerate in the second quarter following a weak start to 2017, when gross domestic product expanded at a 1.4% annual rate during the first quarter.For the recently ended second quarter, forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers projected 2.3% growth and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's high-profile GDPNow model predicted a 2.4% growth pace.Reports on Friday offered fresh insights into the state of the economy, a broadly healthy picture with some downbeat signals headed into the second half of 2017.Markets took bad economic news as good investment news. Low inflation and slow consumer spending growth means the Fed might move more slowly than planned to raise interest rates, which tends to push stocks up. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Friday up 84.65 points, or 0.39%, at a record 21637.74. The S&P 500 also hit a record, rising 11.44 points, or 0.47%, to 2459.27. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.319%, and the dollar weakened.Several of the biggest U.S. banks, while showing stronger-than-expected earnings, saw their shares slide following mixed reports.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the largest U.S. bank by assets, reported record quarterly profit of $7.03 billion. But it also trimmed forecasts for growth in loans and net interest income.Wells Fargo & Co. reported a $6.7 billion decline in average loans from the first quarter. The company's chief financial officer, John Shrewsberry, noted ""softness across the industry,"" but also cited specific actions the bank has taken ""primarily driven by our own risk discipline which have caused our growth to slow.""The bank has pulled back, for example, in auto lending, part of an $11.1 billion drop in its consumer loan portfolio from a year earlier.Retail sales -- a gauge of consumer spending at stores, restaurants and websites -- decreased a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in June after falling 0.1% in May, the Commerce Department said. It was the first back-to-back sales drop since July and August 2016.Sales excluding motor vehicles and gasoline fell 0.1% last month, the first decline for the measure in almost a year.In the second quarter, total retail sales were up just 0.2% from the first three months of the year. But more broadly, sales rose 3.9% in the first half of 2017 compared with the year-earlier period.Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen told lawmakers this past week that growth in household outlays ""continues to be supported by job gains, rising household wealth and favorable consumer sentiment.""But the University of Michigan's sentiment gauge dropped in July for the second straight month, with a preliminary July reading of 93.1 versus 95.1 in June and 97.1 in May. The decline was driven by weaker expectations for future economic gains, though the overall index was still 3.4% higher in June from a year earlier.On inflation, the Labor Department said its consumer-price index was unchanged in June from the prior month. Excluding the often-volatile categories of food and energy, so-called core prices rose just 0.1% for the third straight month.On an annual basis, overall inflation softened to a 1.6% annual gain in June, while core inflation was steady at 1.7% annual growth.The central bank's preferred inflation gauge, the Commerce Department's price index for personal-consumption expenditures, poked above the central bank's 2% goal in February for the first time in nearly five years. It has settled lower each month since. The most recent data, for May, showed a 1.4% year-to-year gain.""We're starting to see some signs of cyclical weakness,"" said Laura Rosner, senior economist at research firm MacroPolicy Perspectives.The Fed has penciled in one more increase for short-term interest rates this year, and also plans to begin shrinking its $4.5 trillion asset portfolio.Continued soft readings on core inflation could damp enthusiasm for higher rates, though Ms. Yellen has said she expects the current weakness will prove transitory and inflation will firm alongside a tightening labor market."
Wells Fargo,"Banks' Results Raise Red Flags --- Earnings climb at three big lenders, but concerns over lending growth hurt shares"," Jul 15, 2017",74.76,1,"A still-challenging environment around lending and interest rates, along with frustration voiced over Washington gridlock, took some of the shine off otherwise solid financial results from three of the biggest U.S. banks.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the biggest U.S. bank by assets, led the way with record profit in the second quarter of $7.03 billion. Even so, executives on Friday cut their projections for lending growth in 2017 as well as for interest income. Shares in the bank and other lenders fell in response, reflecting investors' worries that economic growth might not be strong enough to fuel further gains in bank shares given their postelection run-up.The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index is up about 28% since last November's election, nearly double the performance of the S&P 500 during that time.On Friday, shares of J.P. Morgan dropped 0.9%, while shares in the other two big banks that reported results, Wells Fargo & Co. and Citigroup Inc., fell 1.1% and 0.5%, respectively.Investors' excitement over policy changes that could benefit banks has also cooled amid uncertainty around issues such as a tax-code overhaul or infrastructure spending. Frustration on that front was expressed by J.P. Morgan CEO James Dimon, who challenged Washington to do more to boost the economy.In doing so, he struck a tone more downbeat than the hopeful one many bankers adopted after President Donald Trump's election. ""It's just unfortunate, but it's hurting us, it's hurting the body politic, it's hurting the average American,"" Mr. Dimon said of Washington inaction. ""We have become one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet. It's almost an embarrassment to be an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid shit we have to deal with in this country.""We have to get our act together,"" he added.Mr. Dimon's remarks came shortly after the bank said it expected to increase its net interest income by $4 billion this year, down from an earlier projection of $4.5 billion. A big driver of the reduction has been persistent low yields on longer-term bonds, which reflects skepticism about long-term prospects for economic growth and inflation.Long-term yields are moribund despite four increases in short-term rates by the Federal Reserve since late 2015. That combination weighs on bank profits because it narrows the difference between short- and long-term rates -- a flattening of the yield curve, which is often seen as a negative sign for economic growth.Despite such factors, second-quarter results from J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. beat Wall Street expectations."
Wells Fargo,Banks Get Rousing Wake-Up Call," Jul 15, 2017",73.68,0,"When the industry leader hits sudden headwinds, it can be bad news for the whole sector.Bank stocks, which have rallied in recent weeks, ran out of gas on Friday. J.P. Morgan Chase's downgraded expectations explain why.The bank reported earnings on Friday, along with rivals Citigroup and Wells Fargo. All three beat analyst expectations for earnings, but their stocks fell.J.P. Morgan said it now expects net interest income to rise by about $4 billion this year, down from its earlier expectation of $4.5 billion, on slower loan growth and a decline in long-term interest rates during the second quarter.J.P. Morgan's strong loan growth has stood out in recent quarters, even as lending has slowed nationwide. But in the second quarter, its total loans were up just 4% from a year earlier, compared with 6% in the first quarter and 7% for all of last year. Others are feeling the impact even more strongly. Total average loans at Wells Fargo were up just 1% from a year earlier, compared with 4% in the first quarter.Bankers across the country have said that businesses are hesitant to take out big loans, partly due to uncertainty about policy action in Washington. This could help explain why J.P. Morgan Chase Chief Executive James Dimon showed his frustration with the state of public policy in the U.S. by cursing on Friday's conference call with analysts.While the Federal Reserve's rate increases help banks earn more on their loans, part of this benefit is lost when long-term rates decline. That is what happened for most of the second quarter. There was some hope recently as yields jumped on 10-year Treasurys. But that reversed Friday when the yield fell following weak economic data.The fundamental direction for J.P. Morgan and its peers remains positive. The economy is healthy, and they were just granted permission by the Fed to boost their payouts to investors. If the Fed follows through with plans to keep raising rates and start shrinking its balance sheet later this year, the rate environment will improve further.But bank shares are also no longer cheap.

Wells Fargo,Oil Bets Doom Texas Private-Equity Fund," Jul 17, 2017",71.87,0,"A $2 billion private-equity fund that borrowed heavily to buy oil and gas wells before energy prices plunged is now worth essentially nothing, an unusual debacle that is wiping out investments by major pensions, endowments and charitable foundations. EnerVest Ltd., a Houston private-equity firm that focuses on energy investments, manages the fund. The firm raised and started investing money in 2013, when oil was trading at more than double the current price of about $45 a barrel. But the fund added $1.3 billion of borrowed money to boost its buying power. That later caused it trouble when oil prices tumbled. Now the fund's lenders, led by Wells Fargo & Co., are negotiating to take control of the fund's assets to satisfy its debt, according to people familiar with the matter. ""We are not proud of the result,"" John Walker, EnerVest's co-founder and chief executive, wrote in an email to The Wall Street Journal. The outcome will leave investors in the fund with, at most, pennies for every dollar they invested, the people said. At least one investor, the Orange County Employees Retirement System, already has marked its investment down to zero, according to a pension document. Though private-equity investments regularly flop, industry consultants and fund investors say this situation could mark the first time that a fund larger than $1 billion has lost essentially all of its value. EnerVest's collapse shows how debt taken on during the drilling boom continues to haunt energy investors three years after a glut of fuel sent prices spiraling down. At its onset, the oil bust was expected to cause widespread losses for private-equity investors. While most funds have been able to navigate the downturn and are hanging on while awaiting higher prices, there have been pockets of acute pain. EnerVest's struggles have been among the most severe. Only seven private-equity funds larger than $1 billion have ever lost money for investors, according to investment firm Cambridge Associates LLC. Among those of any size to end in the red, losses greater than 25% or so are almost unheard of, though there are several energy-focused funds in danger of doing so, according to public pension records. EnerVest has attempted to restructure the fund, as well as another raised in 2010 that has struggled with losses, to meet repayment demands from lenders who were themselves writing down the value of assets used as collateral, according topublic pension documents and people familiar with the efforts. Mr. Walker in an interview last year said he and his partners put $85 million of their own money toward satisfying the banks, but it wasn't enough. A number of prominent institutional investors are at risk of having their investments wiped out, including Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, Canada's second-largest pension, which invested more than $100 million. Florida's largest pension fund manager and the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Plan, a manager of retirement savings for union members in nearly 30 states, each invested $100 million, according to public records.The fund was popular among charitable organizations as well. The J. Paul Getty Trust, John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur and Fletcher Jones foundations each invested millions in the fund, according to their tax filings. Michigan State University and a foundation that supports Arizona State University also have disclosed investments in the fund. None of these investors commented. It is possible some of them earlier sold their stakes in the fund, paring losses. In the earlier interview, Mr. Walker said the struggles of EnerVest's 2013 and 2010 funds had sparked ire among his investors: ""We've had some chew us out and hang up on us."" EnerVest was launched in 1992 and says it operates more U.S. oil and gas wells than any other company. It started out investing for GE Capital, General Electric Corp.'s finance arm. Eventually it began pooling other big investors' cash, which it used to buy producing oil and gas wells. EnerVest hunted for fields already producing oil and gas but neglected by big oil companies. Once EnerVest bought them, it made improvements and drilled more to increase output. The strategy isn't as risky as staking wildcatters or borrowing heavily to buy entire oil companies, but profits are usually lower. To juice returns, however, funds managed by EnerVest and rivals that shared the strategy borrowed money as if they themselves were oil companies, encumbering all of the funds' assets with the same debt. Doing that eliminates a key protection for private-equity investors, which generally finance each investment independently so that soured deals don't put good ones at risk. The use of fund-level debt effectively cross-collateralizes assets, meaning that good investments can be pulled down by bad ones. Institutional investors were drawn to these so-called resource funds because they typically pay out steady streams of cash as soon as they make their first investments, unlike other private-equity investments that can take years to bear fruit, said Christian Busken, who advises endowments and other big energy investors as director of real assets for Fund Evaluation Group LLC. ""It shouldn't be something where you can be wiped out. But you are exposed to commodity prices,"" said Mr. Busken, who hasn't worked directly with EnerVest. EnerVest's funds historically returned more than 30% or so, which enabled it to raise progressively larger pools of cash. In 2010, it raised about $1.5 billion for its 12th fund and added $800 million of debt. Three years later it raised $2 billion for its next and borrowed $1.3 billion, according to the firm. The fund bought wells in the Texas Panhandle, Utah, outside Dallas and elsewhere, according to securities filings from some of the sellers. The purchases were made largely as U.S. oil prices hovered in the $100-a-barrel range and when natural-gas prices were higher."

Wells Fargo,"America's Farmers Turn To Bank of John Deere --- As low crop prices curb traditional loans, machinery giant bets on financing"," Jul 19, 2017",74.82,1,"For nearly two centuries, Deere & Co. has built equipment to help farmers plant and harvest their crops. Now, the company's financial muscle is doing more of the work. Throughout the Farm Belt, low prices for corn, soybeans and wheat are putting a strain on U.S. grain farmers, making it harder to get bank lending to plant a crop, or commit to purchasing multimillion-dollar fleets of new equipment. Deere, the world's largest manufacturer of tractors and harvesting combines, is stepping in to fill the gap. It already lends billions to finance farmers' purchases of equipment. Now, it is providing more short-term credit for crop supplies such as seeds, chemicals and fertilizer, making it the No. 5 agricultural lender behind banks Wells Fargo, Rabobank, Bank of the West and Bank of America, according to the American Bankers Association. Deere has also expanded its leasing program to get the company's green and yellow tractors into the hands of farmers, even when they are unable or unwilling to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy one. Its financing has helped farmers stay in business while generating income for Deere during the worst market for machinery sales in more than 15 years. Farmers' incomes will decline for a fourth year this year, to half what they were in 2013, the U.S. Department of Agriculture projects. And inflation-adjusted debt is at a level not seen since the 1980s farm bust. In shoring up the ailing sector, Deere's loans may be helping draw out the pain for farmers, allowing them to continue to rack up debt despite a glut of grain world-wide that is keeping a lid on crop prices. The increase in equipment leasing, meanwhile, is weakening Deere's own market for sales. If crop prices remain subdued, ""you're just prolonging the agony and potentially building up [farm] losses instead of cutting the pain, cauterizing the wound and stanching the flow of financial blood now,"" said Scott Irwin, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois. But if poor weather ultimately spurs grain prices higher, Mr. Irwin said, the risks of farm lending likely would be forgotten, and Deere could win new or more-loyal customers. Deere said it is responding to greater demand for leased equipment from farmers and for short-term credit from other farm-industry manufacturers such as seed companies that are offering aggressive financing through Deere as a sales incentive. ""Our core mission is to support sales of equipment,"" said Jayma Sandquist, vice president of marketing for the U.S. and Canada for John Deere Financial, the company's financing unit. ""It's a cyclical industry. We've built a business that we can manage effectively across all cycles, and our performance would indicate we can do that."" The financing arm has shielded the Moline, Ill., company from the worst of the farm slump, keeping factories and dealers intact and investors satisfied with profits. Despite a 37% drop in sales of its farm equipment since a record high in 2013, Deere's stock price is up 72% from its recent low in early 2016 and up 22% since the start of 2017. Deere Financial's portfolio of loans and leases, which includes short-term lending, leasing and multiyear loans for equipment purchases, totaled $34.7 billion at the end of the company's 2016 fiscal year, in October. Since 2013, the total value of equipment leases held by Deere is up 87%. Loans for farm-equipment purchases, meanwhile, have fallen 10% since peaking in 2014, reflecting sliding machinery sales. Short-term credit accounts for farmers -- used for items such as crop supplies and equipment parts -- are up 38% since the end of 2015. As of early 2017, the bank operation of Deere Financial had handed out about $2.2 billion. It is close on the heels of the No. 4 agricultural lender, Bank of America, which has about $2.6 billion out. ""Deere Financial is a massive force,"" said Robert Wertheimer, a Barclays analyst. Deere, which accounts for about two-thirds of all the big tractors sold in the U.S., ""is able to influence this market. They have more market power than most companies."" Rob Zeldenrust, senior agronomy manager at North Central Co-op in Mentone, Ind., said a farmer who grows corn, soybeans and wheat on 1,000 acres likely would need $250,000 to cover the cost of seed, fertilizer, chemicals, spraying and fuel for a single growing season. Suppliers like Deere can be a lifeline for farmers such as 59-year-old Harry DuRant in South Carolina. Mr. DuRant leases a tractor from Deere, and has charged seed and chemical purchases to lines of credit held by Deere and other suppliers. Together with loans from his local bank, the financing has helped him plant corn, soybeans, peanuts, cotton and other crops despite losing money for three years out of the past four. It has helped him weather floods, a hurricane and total crop failure. But low commodity prices are making it difficult for Mr. DuRant to pay off past debts without taking on new ones. ""It's a vicious cycle,"" Mr. DuRant said, noting that seed companies continually introduce more-expensive, higher-yielding varieties of corn and soybean seeds that appeal to farmers like himself, despite a global oversupply of crops and low grain prices. ""I buy into it because I'm a grower, so of course I want to make 150-bushel corn instead of 120-bushel corn. All we're doing is making the situation worse."" Supplier credit has long played a role in the financial plumbing of the U.S. heartland. But it has grown more crucial in recent years as commercial banks have become choosier, increasing interest rates and collateral requirements and denying financing to some farmers altogether."

Wells Fargo,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Wells Fargo Adds to Branch Changes," Jul 19, 2017",77.02,1,"SIX FLAGS ENTERTAINMENT CEO Steps Down After 17 Months Six Flags Entertainment Corp. said Tuesday that Chief Executive John Duffey is leaving the company after 17 months leading the theme-park operator. Six Flags Executive Chairman Jim Reid-Anderson, who led the company from August 2010 until February 2016, will become CEO effective immediately, the company said. Company spokeswoman Sandra Daniels said Mr. Duffey, 56 years old, left for personal reasons, but she declined to elaborate. Both men have held upper-management positions with the company since 2010. ""I am very proud and excited to rejoin the operating team and look forward to executing our business strategy,"" said Mr. Reid-Anderson, 58. Ms. Daniels called Mr. Duffey ""a key force behind our turnaround story."" Under his leadership, Six Flags opened a 60-acre water park in Oaxtepec, Mexico, its second in the country, and announced plans to develop a second licensed park in China. ""I don't believe I'll ever buy again,"" said Mark Gath, a farmer in Luverne, Minn., who recently decided to lease four combines and five tractors from the company instead of borrowing money to buy. ""I don't have a bank looking at me saying: 'You've got $5 million of equipment debt. What are you going to do?' "" At the end of fiscal 2016, Deere carried leases on farm and lawn equipment valued at $4.8 billion, up 22% from the previous year. Deere quit offering one-year leases last year. The longer-term contracts benefit Deere by having farmers pay more of the machinery's cost through their payments. Deere executives said they are seeing better prices and shrinking inventories for used equipment, as well as improving order volume for new models. Ms. Sandquist said farmers' interest in leasing is waning as their appetite for buying grows again. ""We are certainly seeing leasing coming down, and we're seeing stabilization in used values,"" she said. The company increased its equipment sales-growth forecast for the year to 9% from 4% in May, and it cranked up its net profit outlook to 33% growth, to $2 billion. Turning farmers like Michael Oliver into buyers again will be critical for Deere's future. Mr. Oliver, who farms 32,000 acres near Cadiz, Ky., said he used to trade in and purchase about $12 million worth of machinery -- seven combines and a dozen tractors -- every year before sliding crop prices caused him to start leasing three years ago. But he recently concluded that even that was too costly. He is now extending warranties on old equipment he already owns, saying: ""We're going to use our own equipment, and it looks like we're going to be keeping it for a while."""
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Finance Watch," Jul 21, 2017",79.2,0,"The volume of new loans for farm operations originated by banks in the first half of 2017 fell 7% from a year earlier, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, following a decline in the first half of 2016. Loan volumes in the second quarter ticked up slightly, the bank said. ""It used to be you showed up [at a bank] and said you were a farmer and they said please let us lend you something,"" said Illinois farmer Aaron Wernz, noting that several years ago a $100,000 loan for operating expenses could be secured with a phone call. ""Now they want to make sure their t's are crossed and i's are dotted."" Nate Franzen, president of the agribusiness division of First Dakota National Bank in Yankton, S.D., said the number of high-risk loans at his bank has quadrupled to 12% in the past two years. The bank is working to restructure debt for some borrowers, and urging others to sell land or equipment or vacation homes. He has had to tell a few farmers it couldn't finance them at all. ""As producers get overextended, banks like mine say 'I can't go any further,'"" said Mr. Franzen. ""'We're not going to stick with you until it's all gone.'"" Agribusinesses such as Monsanto Co., DuPont Co., Dow Chemical Co. and agricultural co-ops nationwide offer financing on crop supplies through in-house programs or in partnership with lenders like Deere and Rabobank. BASF SE, one of the world's largest suppliers of pesticides to farms, offers financing exclusively through Deere, and says its program has expanded in the past five years. CHS Inc., a large farmer-owned cooperative in the U.S. that lends widely to farmers, is holding about $250 million in debts owed by a single farm operation, according to court documents. Deere's main rival, CNH Industrial NV -- the maker of CaseIH and New Holland equipment brands -- has also turbocharged its leasing program. But Deere has expanded the reach of its financing business well beyond machinery, and far more than any other manufacturer in the farm sector. The financing business accounted for a third of its net income in fiscal 2016, up from 16% in 2013.Deere's lending arm regularly yields profit margins much greater than Deere's margins for equipment sales -- in 2016, the net margin for financial services was 16%, compared with 4.5% for equipment. Financing profits have also suffered less during the downturn; net income from financing activities fell 17% from 2013, while net income from the equipment business plunged 57% in that period. But Deere's loan or lease balances more than a month past due have doubled since 2012 to $434 million at the close of fiscal 2016, according to an annual regulatory filing for a Deere financial subsidiary for its U.S. business. The amount of debt Deere said it won't be able to collect has doubled since 2014 to $103 million, with more than half of that amount from its crop-supplies credit program. Losses at Deere's financial arm still remain minuscule relative to the size of its finance business. The company said mounting farm debt isn't a significant risk given still-high equity levels -- the difference between total assets and total debt on farms. ""We have many good customers that can continue to repay and stay consistent across underwriting,"" said Deere's Ms. Sandquist. In the longer term, Deere's aggressive leasing activity threatens its core business of selling large, high-horsepower tractors that can cost more than $200,000 apiece, and harvesting combines priced at more than $500,000. Deere accelerated its equipment leasing in 2014 when sales plummeted following almost a decade of rapid-fire purchases by farmers flush with cash. The leasing business has kept Deere from having to idle factories and has provided dealers with income from replacement parts and services for leased equipment. In turn, it has provided farmers with machines for one to three years for a fraction of their purchase price, alleviating the need for loans. A new tractor costing $250,000 can be leased for about $30,000 a year. That compares with the cost to buy with a loan, which would require a 20% down payment of $50,000 and more than $40,000 a year in payments for five years for the remaining $200,000 with 5% interest. At the end of a lease, many farmers have returned their machinery to dealers, adding to an already oversupplied market for used equipment. That pushes down the price farmers who own can get for their used machines, discouraging trade-ins for new models. The lower prices also erode profits for Deere when the machinery is eventually sold."

Wells Fargo,U.S. News: Prices Whet Appetite For Fresh Produce," Jul 25, 2017",48.03,1,"In the battle of fresh versus processed foods, fresh fruits and vegetables are winning, thanks in part to their relatively cheap price tags.Since November 2008, the consumption of fresh fruits has grown 16.2%, while consumption of fresh vegetables is up 20.6%. Consumption of processed fruits and vegetables increased 9.9% during the same time period, notes Eugenio J. Aleman, Wells Fargo senior economist, in a new report.""Consumers have rationally reacted to much higher prices on the processed side in relation to the fresh side,"" Mr. Aleman said. ""In relative terms, fresh fruits and fresh vegetables are cheaper today than processed fruits and vegetables are.""Processed fruits and veggies are in the ""freezer aisle,"" while fresh aren't frozen, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which also considers canned goods processed.Prices of fresh fruits and fresh vegetables were on an upward trajectory leading up to the 2008 recession but have remained relatively stable since. The processed versions of these goods carry higher prices today than they did at any time before the recession.""At some point in time before the Great Recession, pricing policies for the processed fruits and vegetable industry changed considerably with today's prices matching fresh fruit and fresh vegetables much closer than during the pre-Great Recession years,"" the report notes.Of course, it is difficult to distill how much the higher consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables has to do with price-consciousness versus increased health-consciousness. Younger consumers, in particular, have largely shifted to fresh-food consumption. Those under age 40 increased their consumption of fresh vegetables by 52% over the last decade, according to a 2016 report from market-research firm NPD Group Inc.Still, Mr. Aleman notes that if the price of processed food drops to a certain level, consumers are likely to be less concerned with their health and more concerned with their wallets when making grocery decisions."

The Congressional Review Act lets a majority of both chambers rescind a final agency rule issued in the past 60 legislative days. The 231-190 House vote overturns the CFPB's new rule prohibiting class-action waivers in virtually all financial consumer-service agreements. Twenty-four GOP Senators have introduced a similar resolution. Mr. Cordray said the ban would protect consumers, but his own agency's study suggests otherwise. Consumers who prevailed in arbitration recovered on average $5,389 while those who joined class actions received $32. Trial lawyers on average raked in $1 million. Most claims can't be litigated on a class basis -- though trial attorneys try -- and arbitration provides an affordable and expeditious alternative. Companies typically pick up most if not all of the filing, administrative and arbitrator costs. Consumers usually obtain relief within two months, while class actions typically take years to resolve. The rule would cause many firms to stop using arbitration since they would have to spend more defending class actions. The CFPB estimates that financial companies would spend between $2.62 billion and $5.23 billion over the next five years -- much of which would go to attorneys -- to defend some 6,000 class actions. Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, another plaintiff-bar favorite, cites Wells Fargo, which was found to have opened millions of unauthorized accounts in the names of its customers. But Wells Fargo agreed to settle the case on a class basis for $142 million -- twice as much as estimated consumer out-of-pocket losses -- because arbitrating individual disputes could have cost much more. The bank also paid $185 million to regulators and agreed to refund fees for unauthorized accounts. Mr. Cordray wants to build a nationwide plaintiff-lawyer fund-raising base for his Ohio campaign. And he may hope that a few Republican Senators like South Carolina's Lindsey Graham will sink the repeal resolution for their trial-bar campaign donors. But if Republicans stand together on repeal, the CFPB would be prohibited from ever issuing a similar rule. Republicans can strike a blow for the rule of law and against a major progressive cash source for Democrats with a single vote."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: A Startup Applies to Become a Real Bank," Jul 26, 2017",49.44,1,"Within a week of a Trump administration official endorsing the idea of giving bank charters to financial-technology companies, a startup is putting that to the test. Varo Money Inc., a digital banking startup backed by private-equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC, last week formally applied for a national banking charter and deposit insurance, the company said. The filings aren't public yet. Taking those steps could put Varo -- which now partners with banks to provide services for its mobile banking application -- on the path to becoming a full-fledged regulated bank. That means it would take deposits, pay interest, make loans in any state and issue cards, all through smartphone apps. Varo is seeking a national banking charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as well as the ability to take deposits from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Varo was founded in 2015, and initially has joined with banks, including The Bancorp Inc., to provide deposits and lending services. But co-founder and Chief Executive Colin Walsh, a veteran of Wells Fargo & Co. and American Express Co., said that recent discussions with regulators led Varo to accelerate its plans and apply for its own charter now, before it has fully launched its services. Though new bank charters have been rare since the financial crisis, regulators say they are eager to encourage new entrants. Last week, acting OCC head Keith Noreika said ""the federal banking system [needs] to be more inclusive,"" and that the agency was having discussions with interested firms. The approval process typically takes at least a couple of months, and will involve intensive review of the company's plans and financial condition. Becoming a bank would make Varo a more complex investment. Warburg Pincus, the private-equity firm that counts former U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner as its president, can't own more than 24.9% of the bank to avoid being regulated as a bank holding company. So Varo, which raised more than $27 million from Warburg last year, will seek to raise $160 million more from new investors to reduce Warburg's stake and to provide the bank with a capital base, Mr. Walsh said. Mr. Walsh said that Varo's aim is to provide a suite of app-based tools for customers' financial health, such as making a model of future cash flow and suggesting when to move money from checking to savings, pay off a credit card, take out small loans, or invest more in the market. ""We want to be a full-service bank,"" he said."
Wells Fargo,"Automation Stalks Financial Advisers --- Algorithms generate investment advice, undercut traditional 1% fees"," Jul 27, 2017",49.43,0,"Automation is threatening one of the most personal businesses in personal finance: advice. Over the past decade, financial advisers in brokerage houses and independent firms have amassed trillions in assets helping individuals shape investment portfolios and hammer out financial plans. They earn around 1% of these assets in annual fees, a cost advisers say is deserved because they understand clients' particular situations and can provide assurance when markets fall. In the latest test of the reach of technology, a new breed of competitors -- including Betterment LLC and Wealthfront Inc. but also initiatives from established firms such as Vanguard -- is contending even the most personal financial advice can be delivered online, over the phone or by videoconferencing, with fees as low as zero. The goal is to provide good-enough quality at a much lower price. ""It's always been questionable whether or not advisers were earning our money at 1% and up,"" said Paul Auslander, director of financial planning at ProVise Management Group in Clearwater, Fla., who says potential clients now compare him with less expensive alternatives. ""The spread's got to narrow."" The shift has big implications for financial firms that count on advice as a source of stable profits, as well as for rivals trying to build new businesses at lower prices. It also could mean millions in annual savings for consumers and could expand the overall market for advice. Competitors across the spectrum agree the demand is there. Advice ""is big and growing -- it's what clients are looking for,"" said Roger Hobby, executive vice president of private wealth management at Fidelity Investments. The hunger for help marks a shift from the 1990s, when do-it-yourself investing was in vogue. Back then, the adoption of 401(k) plans moved responsibility for investment choices to company employees just as one of the biggest bull markets in history was boosting individuals' confidence in their investing prowess. Meanwhile, pioneering online brokerage firms made trading inexpensive and convenient. After internet stocks collapsed in 2000, along with the broader stock market eight years later, many individuals sought help. In the past decade, baby boomers started to retire and wanted technical guidance on drawing down their assets. The advice industry expanded with the demand. Besides managing people's investment portfolios -- handling the trades, not merely suggesting them -- some financial advisers also provide help with budgets or tax and estate planning. The number of advisory firms grew to almost 3,900 in 2017, up from fewer than 750 in 2002, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Securities and Exchange Commission data. This universe of firms handles at least $100 million in assets each and provides both investment management and financial planning to individuals. As of March 2017, such firms collectively had $5.5 trillion in assets on which they made investment decisions, the Journal's analysis found. That is about six times as much as in 2002. Throughout this period, advice fees have largely held steady -- typically 1% of assets, with a potential discount for big accounts. One reason the standard held is many clients value aspects of advice that can't always be measured or easily compared. C. Lansdowne Hunt, 72, of Burke, Va., said he became more price-conscious after his portfolio fell 31% in the late-2008 stock-market meltdown. So in 2012, he switched to a less expensive adviser, and this year, asked for a discount on its 0.9% fee. After being rebuffed, Mr. Hunt shopped for a new adviser for his $1.3 million portfolio at firms including Charles Schwab Corp., TD Ameritrade Inc. and Edward Jones. The former Naval officer and defense-contractor employee concluded his current Virginia advisory firm offers services, such as tax-sensitive investing and stock picking, that might be hard to replicate for a lower cost. ""I couldn't get the exact twin,"" he said. Many firms are wagering that other customers will take less, for less. About two years ago, Vanguard Group, known for serving do-it-yourselfers, started undercutting the financial-adviser industry with an annual advice fee of 0.3%. Assets in its service, which combines recommendations from computer-driven algorithms with phone, video and email consultations with human advisers, grew to about $35 billion in the first year and to $83 billion by end of last month, according to the firm.Joe McDonald of Titus, Ala., was an early customer. Long a do-it-yourself investor, he decided he needed an adviser after making an ill-timed move into an all-cash portfolio after Barack Obama's 2008 election. ""I pulled out and stayed in cash until 2014, which was a terrible mistake,"" said the 74-year-old retired electrical engineer. ""I found I didn't really have the discipline to stick with my own plan."" He thought about hiring a traditional adviser in Florida who charges 1% of assets under management. His wife wasn't comfortable entrusting money with someone she didn't know, he said. Mr. McDonald said he first invested in a mutual fund from Vanguard in 1983. He liked its 0.3% fee on an account with advice, and moved his roughly $500,000 in retirement accounts there. ""Expenses don't mean a whole lot if you are making 10% a year,"" Mr. McDonald said, ""but if you are making 2% or 3% a year, they are a real big deal."""
Wells Fargo,Borrowing With Stock Soars as Market Rises," Jul 28, 2017",49.59,0,"Wall Street brokerages have been selling billions of dollars in loans backed by stocks and bonds, a trend that yields lucrative fees for the firms but poses risks for borrowers. While banks don't always report these loans in the same way, these securities-backed loans total at least $100 billion for the biggest brokerages -- up exponentially since the financial crisis -- with several billions of dollars of additional debt held at smaller brokerages, banking analysts estimate. Executives at Morgan Stanley earlier this month highlighted these loans to individuals as a big growth area and revenue driver, saying the loans helped expand the bank's overall wealth lending by about $3.5 billion, or 6%, in the second quarter. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. took a step toward expanding its securities-based lending business through a new partnership with Fidelity Investments. The loans work a lot like margin loans. Brokerages lend against the value of an investor's portfolio. But unlike margin lending, customers don't use the debt to buy more securities. Brokerage executives say the loans can help clients avoid selling assets. The client can get cash without shifting their investments; they also avoid potentially locking in losses or incurring taxable gains, or missing out on future stock market gains. Clients are also able to borrow money at relatively low interest rates because the loans are secured. ""Securities based loans can be a valuable financial planning tool for appropriate clients,"" a Morgan Stanley spokesman said. Critics worry that the surging market has made investors numb to the risks of borrowing against their investments -- a scenario that has played out before. In the run-up to the Great Depression, the dot.com bubble of 2000 and the financial crisis, investors binged on margin debt that proved perilous when stocks tumbled. Investors using these loans now could face a similar fate if markets tank and the value of their collateral shrinks, prompting the bank to demand repayment. If the margin call isn't met, the securities backing the loans are sold and the borrower is responsible for any remaining balance. For brokerages, these loans have become a reliable source of revenue in the years since the financial crisis, as firms have begun moving from a business model of charging commissions for trading to a system of fees based on assets under management. The loans themselves help brokers retain these assets because customers don't have to sell stocks and other securities when they need cash. These loans have also become a big factor in brokers' compensation. Several Merrill Lynch brokers said they have asked longstanding clients to open a securities-backed line of credit to help them hit bonus hurdles, assuring that clients wouldn't need to use it or pay any fees for opening it. Merrill brokers receive continuing payments for getting clients to tap credit lines, and those loan balances contribute to year-end bonus calculations, people familiar with the matter said. Brokerage executives have said the longer a client has one of these loans tied to their account, the more likely they are to use it. ""We were dramatically pushed to put these on all of our client accounts,"" said Steven Dudash, a former Merrill Lynch broker who has been managing his own investment-advisory firm since 2014. ""Whenever you're product-pushing, it's not in the client's best interest."" Merrill representatives say its brokers offer these loans to clients in a responsible manner, including disclosing the risks and fees. ""If people need the money, they should sell securities,"" said Terrance Odean, a professor of finance at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. ""It's very risky to take a leveraged position in the market."" Wells Fargo & Co. recently changed practices around how brokers pitch lending products. Starting this year, Wells Fargo stopped offering brokers bonuses tied to how many loans, they opened for clients, executives of the bank have said. As of the end of 2016, clients of Bank of America Corp.'s wealth unit, which includes Merrill Lynch and private bank U.S. Trust, had some $40 billion in such loans outstanding, up 140% from 2010. Morgan Stanley's customers had $30 billion in these loans, more than double from 2013. UBS Group AG and Wells Fargo also have made billions of dollars in such loans, people familiar with those banks said. Morgan Stanley's finance chief, Jonathan Pruzan, said while discussing earnings this month that the bank expects more clients to take out loans in the months ahead. ""That's been a real key driver of our wealth business,"" he said. The growth of securities-backed loans has drawn the attention of regulators, who have questioned the brokerages' marketing and sales efforts as well as the suitability of the loans. Merrill opened more than 121,000 such loan accounts between 2010 and 2014 with more than $85 billion in total credit extended, according to a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority settlement order last year. In the matter, Finra alleged that Merrill didn't fully explain the risks of securities-backed loans and used risky or concentrated investments as collateral. Merrill settled its case without admitting or denying the allegations. Merrill reported its securities-lending oversight lapses to Finra initially and cooperated with the regulator's inquiry, according to Merrill representatives. They said the firm has improved its procedures."
Wells Fargo,Weekend Profile: Trump's Pick to Shake Up the Fed --- Randal Quarles is expected to try to reduce central bank's influence on lenders," Jul 29, 2017",49.25,0,"Randal Quarles became skeptical of government intervention during decades of work in the financial world. Now he is set to take the lead in shaping oversight at one of the greatest interveners of all: the Federal Reserve. Mr. Quarles, who would be President Donald Trump's first appointee to the central bank, is expected to be confirmed in coming months for a four-year term as Fed vice chairman for supervision. That would make him the most influential U.S. financial regulator and give him a voice on monetary policy. His de facto predecessor, former Fed governor Daniel Tarullo, engineered broad new curbs on risk-taking by the largest U.S. banks. Mr. Quarles, a 59-year-old amateur pilot and former government official who has made millions advising and investing in banks, has a record that suggests he will seek to reduce the Fed's influence on bankers' decisions, rather than expand it. ""Some refinements will undoubtedly be in order,"" Mr. Quarles told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, referring to the U.S. regulatory regime. ""The key question will be ensuring that . . . we do so while maintaining the robust resilience of the system to shocks."" Mr. Quarles's approach may conflict with that of Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, who supported Mr. Tarullo's agenda. Her term as chair ends in February. Mr. Quarles has separately advocated that the Fed articulate a more rigid formula for setting monetary policy, an idea Ms. Yellen has criticized. Friends and former colleagues said that if Mr. Quarles does try to change direction at the Fed, they expect him to move slowly and methodically, and to seek consensus. Cerebral with a wry wit, Mr. Quarles spent nights as a young lawyer at Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP reading the firm's files on railroad reorganizations in the late 19th century. ""I had been interested in the history of that era,"" he explained in a 2010 paper. When asked, ""How are you?"" he has a stock reply, former colleagues say: ""Better than average."" Mr. Tarullo, who left the Fed in April, cracked the whip on the largest U.S. banks in part by employing the element of surprise. In ""stress tests"" and ""living wills"" examining how banks plan for the worst scenarios, he and other regulators ratcheted up their expectations over time and publicly rebuked bankers for perceived failings -- scoldings that the regulators said were necessary to clean up what they saw as woeful risk management. Bankers have called for years for more predictability in the exams, in part to avoid further public thrashings. At his confirmation hearing Thursday, Mr. Quarles said the Fed should publish more information about the stress tests. ""The benefits of the transparency outweigh any of the theoretical costs,"" he said. Mr. Quarles also said he would review rules about banks' capital levels as well as the Volcker rule, which restricts banks from trading unless it is on customers' behalf. He avoided specifics. ""I don't have a view as to whether [capital requirements] should be higher or lower,"" he said. During his career, Mr. Quarles has repeatedly criticized unpredictable policy-making. ""When governments have discretion, markets and citizens cannot be sure how the government will act, and that uncertainty results in inefficiency, delay and politicization,"" he wrote in the 2010 paper. He said in 2015 that regulatory policy since the 2008 financial crisis ""tended to make the government a player"" in the financial sector when ""it should be a referee."" At the same time, Mr. Quarles has separated himself from others who claim the ""free market"" mantle. As a senior Treasury official in the 2000s, he advocated allowing foreign governments to have more wiggle room in dealing with bond investors -- a policy opposed by some Wall Street money managers. He once called Timothy Geithner, President Barack Obama's first Treasury secretary and an architect of the 2008 bailouts, ""a very strong choice"" for the cabinet position. Ravi Menon, a Singaporean official who engaged in last-minute talks with Mr. Quarles on a U.S.-Singapore trade deal, wrote in 2004, ""Right from the start, we took a problem-solving approach aimed at finding middle ground rather than trying to convert each other on ideological arguments."" Still, Mr. Quarles's background has raised concerns among Democrats. As a banking lawyer at Davis Polk in the 1990s, he helped banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. navigate regulatory limits to expand their securities businesses. He joined executives from J.P. Morgan and HSBC Holdings PLC at the Salzburg Global Seminar, held in the Austrian Alps at the hotel where ""The Sound of Music"" was filmed, and co-led a discussion on the future of banking. During the financial crisis, as a partner at private-equity giant Carlyle Group, he lobbied successfully for regulators to allow him and other big money managers to pump money into troubled banks. ""The primary purpose of this job is to stand up to the largest financial institutions in this country,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) told Mr. Quarles Thursday. ""You have no history of having done that."" Despite the Democrats' concerns, Republicans alone have the votes to confirm Mr. Quarles for the job, and none criticized him Thursday. It isn't clear when they will vote on his confirmation. Mr. Quarles has donated a total of about $200,000 to Republicans since 1995, including the 2016 presidential bids of Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and the Senate bid of Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R., Idaho), federal records show. He also was an adviser to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign in 2012. Mr. Quarles has had financial ties to some banks he could soon regulate. He married into Utah's Eccles family, which received a stake in Wells Fargo & Co. through the sale of a Utah bank in 2000. His financial disclosure, which was signed in June, said he owns Wells Fargo stock valued at more than $1 million and has exercised lines of credit of more than $1 million each from Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley. Since 2014, he has helped manage the family's wealth at Cynosure Group, investing in financial companies including a Georgia bank holding company, Brand Group Holdings Inc. Mr. Quarles has pledged that if he is confirmed, he will unwind his bank holdings and pay back the loans to meet conflict-of-interest rules. Morgan Stanley agreed to a $1 million settlement with the regulator in April without admitting or denying wrongdoing. A Morgan Stanley spokesman said Massachusetts found no evidence that any clients were harmed or that any of the loans were unsuitable or unauthorized. ""We have taken steps to strengthen and clarify our policies and controls,"" he said."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Wells Fargo Plans Refunds --- Insurance problems related to auto-loan customers will cost the bank $80 million," Jul 29, 2017",48.73,1,"In another regulatory action, the Massachusetts securities watchdog last year accused Morgan Stanley of developing a sales program that encouraged brokers to pitch these loans regardless of whether clients needed them."
Wells Fargo,"Where There's Smoke, There's Fire"," Jul 29, 2017",49.04,1,"Wells Fargo & Co. said it plans to make refunds to certain auto-loan customers who may have been improperly charged for some auto insurance. The bank late Thursday said it found 570,000 customers who may have been affected from policies placed between 2012 and 2017, and that they will get refunds or account adjustments totaling around $80 million. Franklin Codel, head of Wells Fargo consumer lending, said the bank takes responsibility for its failure to manage the insurance program and apologized to customers. ""Upon our discovery, we acted swiftly to discontinue the program and immediately develop a plan to make impacted customers whole,"" he said. Asked about Wells Fargo's auto-insurance practices, a spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said he couldn't comment on ongoing supervisory issues or pending actions. The bank's auto-loan problems come on the heels of Wells Fargo's sales-practices scandal last year, in which bank employees opened as many as 2.1 million accounts using fictitious or unauthorized customer information. Wells Fargo paid a $185 million fine in September 2016, its chief executive abruptly retired, and it has continued facing many federal and state investigations since then. The bank has said it is cooperating with those. Wells Fargo agreed to a $142 million class-action customer settlement along with related customer refunds. Regarding the auto loans, Wells Fargo said customers' contracts require them to maintain collateral-protection insurance on behalf of the lender throughout the term of the loan. Wells Fargo purchased that insurance, known as CPI, from a vendor on a customer's behalf if there was no evidence the customer already had the insurance, the bank said. That insurance protects against the loss or damage to a vehicle serving as collateral to secure a loan. The vendor is National General Insurance, a company the bank had joined with for years, a person familiar with the matter said.A spokeswoman for National General, Christine Worley, said it ""feels confident with its compliance in this highly regulated industry."" She added: ""We have always refunded premiums directly to our financial institution customers in a timely manner and provided all necessary notifications in compliance with law and industry practice.""Wells Fargo said that, in response to customer complaints in July 2016, it began a review of the program and third-party vendor practices. Based on that review, it discontinued the program in September 2016.The New York Times earlier reported the problems with Wells Fargo's auto insurance, citing a report from consultant Oliver Wyman prepared for the bank examining National General insurance policies sold to Wells Fargo customers from January 2012 through July 2016. It found the insurance was often more expensive than auto-insurance customers had already obtained on their own.Wells Fargo said it has ""gone through a comprehensive review using independent consultants"" that determined certain external vendor processes and internal controls were inadequate.For instance, one result was that customers may have been charged premiums for this insurance even if they were paying for their own vehicle insurance. In some cases, those premiums could have contributed to a default that led to the vehicle's repossession.The bank has begun providing refunds to some customers and will send letters and refund checks to additional customers in August. The bank said it expects to complete the refunding process by year-end."

Wells Fargo,Fed Looks To Ease Curbs on Directors," Aug 4, 2017",49.09,1,"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve proposed scaling back the requirements it places on banks' boards of directors, its latest move to recalibrate regulations as it takes stock of rules adopted since the financial crisis.The Fed said Thursday that after talking with bankers and reviewing its policies for supervising bank directors, it determined that it has been overloading boards with too many specific requirements, making it difficult for them to focus on big-picture strategy and risk management.""The sense of [today's action] is not at all to lighten the workload of directors or make their life easier,"" said Fed governor Jerome Powell, the central bank's regulatory point person, in an interview. ""Our expectations are very high. . . . It is an attempt to get them out of the weeds and put them focusing on the big issues.""Mr. Powell said the Fed had been reviewing expectations for bank directors since at least 2014. Thursday's announcement would change policies adopted both before and after the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed said it would look for more changes to its rules in the future.The Fed's move is likely to be welcomed by bankers, who have said for years that requirements placed on boards have become excessive.""The process is just too much. Most directors are just drowning in process,"" said Timothy Ryan, chairman of Banco Santander SA's U.S. holding company, at a June conference on financial regulation in Washington. ""Too much of it is . . . not really correlated to improving the operation of the bank.""The move comes as some lawmakers question the Fed's oversight of Wells Fargo & Co.'s board in the wake of disclosures that the bank opened phony accounts in customers' names and improperly charged them for auto-insurance products.Mr. Powell declined to comment on Wells Fargo.Fed officials, he said, had counted hundreds of instances in which its regulations and guidance included the phrase ""the board shall.""""If you get off into the weeds, the big things pass you by,"" he said. Instead, boards should focus on such questions as, ""Do we have a risk-management framework that truly captures, measures and deals with the risks of this large financial institution?""Answering that question, he said, ""is not easier than going down a list of 30 potential risks.""After the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed and other regulators judged that boards had done a poor job of supervising management at big banks and began holding more frequent meetings with members of banks' boards. They also began to single out boards more frequently when critiquing banks' risk management.Laban Jackson, independent director at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., said at the June conference that regulators shouldn't attend board meetings, a practice he said has become more common.The conference was hosted by two big bank trade groups, the Clearing House Association and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.""I think boards did a lousy job before the crisis,"" Mr. Jackson said, but with regulators in the room, directors are ""very careful what they say, which doesn't make any sense to me. Boards should be completely open."""
Wells Fargo,Berkshire Profit Drops 15% --- Results hurt by lower investment gains and a loss in insurance underwriting business," Aug 5, 2017",49.24,1,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. reported a 15% decline in second-quarter earnings, dragged down by lower investment gains and a loss in its insurance underwriting segment.Berkshire reported second-quarter net earnings of $4.26 billion, or $2,592 a Class A equivalent share, from $5 billion, or $3,042 a share, a year earlier. Operating earnings, which exclude some investment results, fell to $4.12 billion, or $2,505 a Class A share, from $4.61 billion, or $2,803 a Class A share, a year earlier.Meanwhile, the operating profit of its insurance underwriting business, which includes Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, swung to a $22 million loss from a profit of $337 million a year earlier.Book value, Mr. Buffett's preferred yardstick for measuring net worth, rose to $182,816 a Class A equivalent share as of June 30, a 6.2% increase for the first half of the year. Last year, Berkshire reported a 2.9% increase in book value for the comparable six-month period.Before the latest results, Berkshire's Class A shares closed Friday at a record of $270,000, up 11% for the year.The Nebraska-based conglomerate runs a large insurance operation as well as railroad, utilities, industrial manufacturers and retailers. Its holdings include such names as Dairy Queen, Duracell, Fruit of the Loom, Geico and See's Candies.Still, the insurance business, the engine that has fueled Berkshire's expansion, remains at the core of its moneymaking machine, bringing in billions of dollars of ""float,"" upfront premiums paid by customers that Berkshire invests for its own gain.Insurance float rose to $107 billion in the most recent period.Berkshire's largest stockholdings include Wells Fargo & Co., down 4% for the year, and Apple Inc., whose stock has gained more than one-third in value this year.

The OCC is considering taking further action in light of the new, insurance revelations, the people familiar with the matter said. Although it isn't clear what form that could take, the OCC has broad power to restrict acquisitions and other banking activities. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said the bank has ""worked diligently to fully identify what went wrong and to make things right for our customers"" since it identified the insurance problem in mid-2016. The OCC became aware of the insurance issue when Wells Fargo executives identified and reported it to them last summer. This spring, it made a request to the bank for more information on specific auto-insurance practices, one of the people familiar with the matter said.Regarding the auto loans, Wells Fargo said in late July that customers' auto-loan contracts require them to maintain collateral-protection insurance on behalf of the lender throughout the term of the loan. Wells bought that insurance from a vendor on a customer's behalf if there was no evidence the customer already had the insurance, the bank said. That insurance protects against the loss or damage to a vehicle serving as collateral to secure a loan.A result was that customers may have been charged premiums for insurance even if they had their own insurance. In some cases, those premiums could have contributed to a default that led to the vehicle's repossession. Wells realized there was a problem with this insurance while working on broader fair-lending reviews in mid-2016 and spotting problems in the collections process, among other factors, people familiar with the reviews said.Wells Fargo reported the insurance problems to the OCC in summer 2016 and provided the regulator with an internal report from consultants Oliver Wyman that detailed issues in this area. Late last month, the New York Times reported the improper insurance charges and internal report."
Wells Fargo,MetLife's Former Insurance Unit Has Tough Task Ahead," Aug 7, 2017",49.38,0,"Shares of Brighthouse Financial, MetLife Inc.'s spun-off insurance operation, will begin trading on Monday in the industry's latest response to nearly a decade of ultralow rates.Brighthouse is built around MetLife's historic core selling life insurance to U.S. households. In recent decades, the unit grew to be one of the nation's biggest sellers of retirement-income annuities to consumers. But the ultralow interest rates ushered in by the global financial crisis of 2008 have hurt the profitability of these products.The concept behind the spinoff is simple: For MetLife, the goal is a higher share valuation once the company is freed of slower-growing operations and facing less pressure from low interest rates. For Brighthouse, the hope is that by ""standing on its own two feet, being smaller, more nimble,"" the firm can perform better, said MetLife Chief Executive Steve Kandarian during an interview.""We think MetLife has good risk-management, but now Brighthouse has to function on its own,"" said Deep Banerjee, a credit analyst with S&P Global Ratings. ""How will it execute as an independent insurer?""After the Brighthouse spinoff, roughly 40% of MetLife's business will be international life insurance, which is less affected by low rates than in the U.S. MetLife also will continue selling insurance and pension products to employers, and it is keeping an asset-management unit and some other operations.Brighthouse must first win the confidence of independent brokerage firms, financial advisers and outside agent groups to sell its products, analysts said. In a move that reduced costs, MetLife last year sold its agent network to Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co.Brighthouse Chief Executive Eric Steigerwalt said the new company is in a good position to make sales.""We've kept the vast majority of our distributor relationships"" from the MetLife years, he said. Brighthouse also will sell annuities through MassMutual's enlarged sales force.Mr. Steigerwalt's team is a mix of experienced MetLife managers and new hires. The company has agreements with MetLife for such things as call centers and investment management.""Over the next couple years, we will transition off of the MetLife agreements,"" he said.Brighthouse also will have a large segment of ""runoff"" business of contracts MetLife sold and Brighthouse is responsible for, but which aren't currently being marketed. Mostly, these are certain types of life-insurance policies.U.S. life insurers' core business has long been under pressure. Sales of individual policies have been largely flat industrywide for nearly a decade, after falling more than 40% from the 1980s through 2008, according to industry-funded research group Limra.Low interest rates depress the income insurers earn by investing customers' premiums until claims are paid. They also drive up the cost of hedging annuities' lifetime-income guarantees, and they make it tough to turn profits on products that guarantee specified annual interest."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Wells Fargo Faces Auto-Loan Headache --- Bank's new regulatory scrutiny concerns insurance sold through auto dealerships," Aug 9, 2017",49.31,0,"Wells Fargo & Co. is facing more regulatory scrutiny related to auto-insurance practices. The latest questions concern guaranteed asset protection the bank sold through car dealerships, a person familiar with the matter said. The San Francisco Federal Reserve made an inquiry about control breakdowns related to those matters, the person said. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is also probing the practices, people familiar with the situation said. The insurance products offer consumers additional protection beyond standard auto-insurance policies and are often financed as part of the customer's loan. For instance, if a customer has an accident and the vehicle is totaled, so-called GAP insurance could help pay off the loan balance not covered by the customer's primary insurance. The San Francisco Fed, one of several regulators overseeing different parts of San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, focuses on safety and soundness of banks, such as compliance and controls. The latest inquiry didn't trigger a new investigation and was part of the overall supervisory process, the person added. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Catherine Pulley said in a statement: ""During an internal review, we discovered issues related to a lack of oversight and controls surrounding the administration of guaranteed asset protection . . . products."" Borrowers are entitled to a refund of some of the GAP insurance if loans are paid off early. Ms. Pulley added the bank is working to make the customer-refund process ""more consistent for customers"" and pointed to the bank's disclosures about these issues in its most recent quarterly filing in efforts to be more transparent. Ms. Pulley declined to comment on how many customers might be affected or when these issues began. The New York Times earlier reported the San Francisco Fed's inquiry into Wells Fargo on the matter. This is the most recent headache for Wells Fargo. The bank in late July said it is refunding around $80 million to as many as 570,000 auto-loan customers over other insurance practices known as collateral protection insurance. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is considering taking further action in light of those insurance revelations, although it isn't clear yet what form that could take. That is on top of the bank's sales-practices scandal that erupted about a year ago and resulted in a settlement, congressional hearings and the departure of then-Chief Executive John Stumpf. Several investigations related to that settlement continue; the bank has said it is cooperating. In the bank's quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, disclosed Friday, Wells Fargo said issues related to auto loans ""may subject the company to formal or informal inquiries, investigations or examinations"" from federal, state or local government agencies, as well as potential litigation."

Wells Fargo,Business &amp;amp; Finance," Aug 11, 2017",49.63,0,"The board of Wells Fargo & Co., grappling with fresh problems even as it tries to move past the bank's sales-practices scandal, is planning a shake-up that is likely to include Stephen Sanger stepping down as nonexecutive chairman, according to people familiar with the matter. Directors are aiming to make final decisions on any changes by Labor Day, some ofthe people said. Mr. Sanger is expected to step down before the bank's shareholder meeting next spring, one of these people said. Vice Chair Elizabeth Duke, a former Federal Reserve governor, is then likely to take the top spot, some of these people said. Discussions about board changes have been under way for a few months, spurred by dismal results at the bank's shareholder meeting. They also come against the backdrop of calls in Washington for even more dramatic action at the bank. Neither Mr. Sanger or Ms. Duke responded to requests for comment. Wells Fargo, the third-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has spent most of the past year trying to put last fall's sales-practices scandal behind it. The scandal showed employees had opened as many as 2.1 million accounts without customers' knowledge, sparking public and political outcries as well as numerous investigations.More recently, the bank has said even more customer accounts may have been affected. It also is facing a new scandal in its auto-lending unit over insurance policies involving many borrowers. The bank has said it would reimburse customers for around $80 million.Mr. Sanger became nonexecutive chairman last October when then Chairman and Chief Executive John Stumpf abruptly retired in the face of the sales-practices scandal. Mr. Sanger was previously the lead director and had been on the board since 2003.He previously had been CEO of packaged-food company General Mills Inc. until September 2007 and was its chairman until 2008. Mr. Sanger also is a director of Pfizer Inc.Since his elevation, Mr. Sanger and other board members have contended with continued revelations about problems within Wells Fargo.In addition, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) in June mounted a public campaign to press the Federal Reserve to remove a dozen directors at the bank who served during the period when bad behavior occurred.Even before that, shareholders at the bank's annual meeting in April had given only tepid support to the board. Nine directors, including Mr. Sanger, received less than 75% approval for their re-election.Mr. Sanger garnered only 56% of the vote -- far below the 95% or more that most directors usually receive.Shareholders expressed even greater displeasure with Enrique Hernandez, head of the bank's risk committee. He received just 53% of the vote."

Wells Fargo,Buffett Cashes In on Crisis-Era GE Shares," Aug 15, 2017",51.23,1,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is getting out of one of America's oldest companies: General Electric Co. The billionaire investor's firm sold 10.6 million GE shares in the second quarter, a stake that would have been worth an estimated $315 million as of June 30, according to a regulatory filing. Berkshire received most of the shares in 2013 after the investor lent roughly $3 billion to GE in October 2008 during the depths of the financial crisis. In addition to the shares, Berkshire received hundreds of millions in dividends from GE over several years. All told, Mr. Buffett's $3 billion crisis-era investment generated a profit of more than $1 billion. Berkshire's decision to cash out its GE stake came in the same quarter that the conglomerate announced it was changing leaders, with Jeff Immelt stepping aside as chief executive after 16 years and handing over the job to one of his lieutenants, John Flannery. Mr. Immelt had been under pressure from activist investor Trian Fund Management to cut costs and analysts have expressed concerns the company will need to lower its profit targets. GE shares have slumped this year, dropping nearly 20%, compared with a 10% gain in the S&P 500 index. It is the worst performing member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average year to date. Last week, Mr. Flannery disclosed he had increased his personal investment by buying $2.7 million worth of GE shares in his 401(k) plan. GE declined to comment on Mr. Buffett's disclosure. The company is the second U.S. blue chip that Mr. Buffett has recently exited. The billionaire sold off the majority of his long-held stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. late last year. The holdings were disclosed Monday in a 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a quarterly requirement for investors managing more than $100 million. The GE deal was one of a series of transactions Mr. Buffett made during the 2008 financial crisis, including separate investments with Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. He continues to own stakes in both of those financial giants. Also in the second quarter, Berkshire bought shares of Synchrony Financial, GE's former consumer finance unit, and added to positions in Bank of New York Mellon Corp and Apple Inc. A seemingly unending rally in U.S. stocks got a mixed forecast from some of the world's most well-known investors, their filings suggest. David Tepper's Appaloosa Management sold its entire stake in the SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund in the quarter. That ETF aims to track the performance of the broader market. Appaloosa had more than $350 million in the ETF at one point in the quarter."

Wells Fargo,Business &amp;amp; Finance," Aug 25, 2017",52.02,1,"Wells Fargo & Co. and U.S. Bancorp have signed deals with mortgage-software startup Blend Labs Inc. to move more of their loan applications online. The five-year-old San Francisco company announced its new customers Thursday along with a fresh $100 million fundraising round. The software from Blend offers the two lenders a chance to compete better against nimble financial-technology offerings such as Rocket Mortgage, the Quicken Loans Inc. product that has attempted to speed up the often-tedious mortgage-application process. Minneapolis-based U.S. Bank says the latest changes eventually could trim four or five days off the process, which takes roughly six weeks on average. The actual time to apply eventually could be sliced in half, says Tom Wind, president of U.S. Bank's mortgage division. ""I've never chosen a startup for a project of this size and scale before,"" said Michael DeVito, Wells Fargo's head of mortgage production. The bank, which extended $100 billion in home loans in the first half of the year, started inviting some applicants to try the Blend technology late last year. It is looking to roll out the product nationally in 2018. Blend, part of a new crop of fintech firms that aim to work with banks rather than compete directly against them, said the fundraising round was led by venture-capital firm Greylock Partners. Greylock's Jerry Chen is joining Blend's board. The $100 million deal will bring the company's valuation to roughly $500 million, according to people familiar with the matter. Other Blend investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Emergence Capital, Founders Fund, and Conversion Capital LLC. Blend's software already is used for websites or smartphone applications at about 30 lenders, including Movement Mortgage LLC. In addition to powering a version of the product that is similar to Rocket Mortgage, Blend can be used by loan officers based in retail branches or call centers. The ability to serve those different groups helped persuade banks that Blend simply wasn't looking to replace their existing sales staff with computers. The company's software automates the loan-application process by filling in forms electronically through direct connections to information sources. For example, Blend taps Intuit Inc. to pull figures from tax returns filed through TurboTax, Automatic Data Processing Inc. to verify incomevia pay stubs, and Plaid Technologies Inc. to find the value of assets in bank and brokerage accounts. Run by CEO Nima Ghamsari, Blend expects to use the proceeds from its fundraising to expand in other forms of consumer credit and develop technology to make other manual parts of the home-loan process, such as appraisal and closing, more digital. The latest fundraising would signal to lenders that the company would be able to ride out any market dips, Mr. Ghamsari said. Wells Fargo executives have mentioned its work with Blend in recent months, without giving details. While Blend has worked closely with banks, the business model for online lenders of taking them on directly has struggled. Making loans to consumers and small business directly over the internet and getting money managers to bear the risk of defaults captivated investors as recently as 2015. But a series of stumbles helped lead to a wave of layoffs, executive changes and a 75% slump in venture-capital investment in the sector. ""There's definite skepticism around whether or not these things will be legacies or whether they'll be fads,"" Mr. Ghamsari said of Silicon Valley's online lenders. He said their ascent helped raise awareness among traditional financial institutions, which had spent the preceding years wholly focused on regulatory compliance, not innovation."

Wells Fargo,Ford Begins Car-Loan Push," Aug 26, 2017",53.75,1,"A major auto lender has decided to change its approval process to look beyond credit scores in an effort to pump up sales.The move by Ford Motor Co.'s financing unit, announced Friday, is expected to unfold in coming years, even as concerns mount about rising auto-loan losses in the industry.Ford Motor Credit says it is looking at ways to increase loan and lease approvals for applicants with limited credit histories. These consumers are often denied credit because they lack a history of managing debt and as a result have low credit scores. Ford's credit division plans to review new data to try to determine whether these customers, as well as those with more robust borrowing histories, are likely to repay their loans.Subprime auto lending industrywide has allowed consumers with missed loan payments and other blemishes on their credit reports to get financing. This helped fuel new U.S. car sales, which hit record highs in 2015 and again in 2016. But as losses have worsened, many lenders have pulled back on originations to risky borrowers.Ford's U.S. sales were down 4.3% for the first seven months of the year compared with the same period a year prior, while total U.S. new auto sales fell 2.8%, according to Edmunds.com. Wells Fargo & Co.'s auto-lending volume fell 45% in the second quarter from a year earlier due to tightening underwriting standards. Ally Financial Inc.'s auto-loan originations fell 8.5% for the same period.Some lenders are looking elsewhere to drive loan volume. One area of focus is borrowers who have low credit scores because they haven't used debt from banks and other mainstream lenders.Ford Credit is among the largest U.S. lenders to say that it is looking at using alternative methods of underwriting, beyond the traditional factors that are mostly centered on credit reports. ""No financial services firm would take that decision lightly,"" said Jim Moynes, vice president of risk management at Ford Credit.A string of smaller financing providers, including credit unions and online lenders, have also been assessing factors outside of credit reports and scores for applicants with thin credit records.Ford Credit is hoping the new ways to assess credit will better predict risk among a broad array of borrowers. While its charge-off rate is lower than the industry average, losses are rising. The company wrote off $82 million in U.S. consumer loans and leases as a loss in the second quarter, up 30% from a year prior.Ford Credit says it doesn't think its decision will lead to more losses because it will be reviewing more data than it currently checks on loan applicants. While the overall result will likely be more loan approvals, there will be some tightening as well as because some borrowers who currently get approved might not under the new model."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Auto-Lending Products Under Scrutiny," Aug 29, 2017",53.2,1,"Regulators are reviewing some auto-lending procedures, including those related to borrower refunds, at several banks and other financing businesses in the wake of problems at Wells Fargo & Co., according to people familiar with the matter.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are examining guaranteed-asset-protection products and the refund processes associated with them at these firms, the people said.The CFPB is focusing on the refunding process, these people added. It isn't clear whether the regulatory reviews will lead to any action.Wells Fargo previously had disclosed that during an internal review it discovered issues relating to the administration of GAP products, particularly customer refunds.The regulatory reviews are happening as many lenders themselves check up on their internal controls around the GAP products and related refunds.Capital One Financial Corp., Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc., and U.S. Bancorp are among banks that are reviewing their GAP product-refund policies given the situation at Wells Fargo, according to people familiar with the matter. While reviews occur on a continuing basis, the banks are taking a closer look at procedures meant to ensure borrowers who are entitled to refunds receive them, the people said.GM Financial, Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp., Infiniti Financial Services and Ford Motor Credit Co. are among captive-finance companies checking their internal controls and refunding processes as well, people familiar with the firms said. It isn't clear whether the firms will make changes or what those will be.GAP coverage is typically sold to consumers through car dealerships. The products offer consumers additional protection beyond standard auto-insurance policies and are often financed as part of the customer's loan.For instance, if a customer has an accident and the vehicle is totaled, GAP waivers could help pay off the loan balance that isn't covered by the customer's primary insurance. Laws in nine states require that customers receive refunds for unused coverage periods, and the holder of the contract -- the lender -- often ensures this is done properly.Some lenders use a third-party provider to oversee the refunding process. Some of those providers, including World Omni Financial Corp., have received questions from lenders following news of Wells Fargo's problems, people familiar with the matter said."
Wells Fargo,Equities: Storm Drives Up Refiners' Stocks," Aug 29, 2017",51.68,1,"Shares of companies that churn crude into fuel rallied, as Tropical Storm Harvey inundated the Texas Gulf Coast with punishing rains.Refining capacity totaling more than two million barrels a day has been taken offline, causing prices of gasoline and diesel fuel to jump on concerns supplies will be tight with fewer refineries able to churn out fuel. That reduced demand weighed on oil prices.As a result, companies with plants that are still up and running -- especially those with plants nowhere near the storm -- stand to benefit from surging refining margins. Shares of PBF Energy Inc., which has refineries in Delaware, New Jersey, Ohio, California and Louisiana, rose 8.3% on Monday. HollyFrontier Corp., largely concentrated in the Midwest, gained 6.5%.

In prior Gulf Coast hurricanes, refining shares have outperformed major indexes by as much as 19% in the days following landfall, says Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read.""Overall, each refining company will tend to benefit (at least from a margins, earnings, and stock price perspective) from periods of disruption like this, even if they have assets affected,"" Raymond James analysts wrote in research note.Adding to investors' optimism is that there have been few reports that plants in the storm's path have been damaged. Several refiners in Texas have stopped making fuel or slowed down, but many reported that the move was a precautionary measure, or a necessary response to logistical issues with pipelines and ports.Valero has said its Corpus Christi-area refineries are relatively unscathed and it is looking at ways to restart them. Citgo Petroleum Corp. said it is ""assessing the refinery"" but didn't provide a restart date.""At this stage, most of the refining outages are reported as preventive, with only a few comments on minor flooding. However, the slow moving nature of the storm will likely lead to these shutdowns continuing in coming days,"" analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote Monday. They said another 850,000 barrels a day of refining capacity could be hobbled if the storm moves further east.And the worst may not be over for plants in Houston, where the storm is expected to make landfall again on Wednesday, and flooding is expected to worsen. Flooding can ruin the electric pumps that send crude through a refinery's complex network of piping, and an influx of brackish water can lead to corrosion. Repairs for serious issues can take weeks or even months."

The move makes the famous stock picker's firm the largest shareholder of the second- and third-largest U.S. banks -- the third being Wells Fargo & Co. -- while also providing a vote of confidence for Bank of America stock.""Berkshire is going to keep every share for a very long time,"" Mr. Buffett said in an email to the Journal Tuesday.Berkshire's exercise of the warrants, along with dividends the company has received on Bank of America preferred stock, brings its paper gain on its investment in the bank to around $13 billion.Berkshire bought preferred shares in the bank in 2011 when the lender sorely needed to shore up investor sentiment. Bank of America's share price was slumping as investors grew worried about potentially billions of dollars in legal claims and fines related to the crisis.Mr. Buffett helped change the market's perception with the investment and by calling the bank ""well led.""The $5 billion deal also included warrants for Berkshire to buy 700 million shares of Bank of America common stock for $7.14 apiece.At the time, the strike price was slightly above where Bank of America's shares were trading.

Shares of banks more heavily concentrated in Texas and the cities affected are down more sharply.Houston, as the country's fourth-largest city, is a significant market for many banks, representing about 2% of big-bank deposits and U.S. mortgage origination volume, according to analysts at Autonomous Research.Texas is a larger market for auto loans, but unlike home loans, most auto-insurance policies cover flooding, Autonomous Research analyst Brian Foran said.Some regional and local banks have higher concentrations of loans and deposits, however.Regional banks Prosperity Bancshares and Zions Bancorp have 30% and 19%, respectively, of their deposits in the Houston area, according to analysts at Barclays PLC. Their shares are off around 2.9% and 2.2%, respectively, since Friday's close. Houston-based Allegiance Bancshares Inc., a commercial bank to small and medium-size businesses, has virtually all of its deposits in the Houston metropolitan area, analysts said. George Martinez, chief executive of Allegiance, said that the bank planned to begin reopening some branches Wednesday. ""We have to go through a period of adjustment for our business customers, but then they'll return to their regular strategies,"" he said. He noted that customers who used electronic banking ""hadn't been slowed down."" Allegiance shares are down 7.5% since Friday's close. Prosperity CEO David Zalman said the bank closed about 25% of its Texas branches on Monday -- or about 60 branches, mostly in coastal towns -- but had reopened many the next day. It also shifted some operations to West Texas and Dallas, he said. ""We're used to this,"" he said, citing Texas' history with past hurricanes. Despite Harvey's unusually dramatic impact, he said that ""in the long run, this will create a robust economy for the state. You'll see deposits increase in Texas banks because of the insurance money."" Shares of Green Bancorp Inc., a commercial and consumer bank also based in Houston, are off 8.9%.

Wells Fargo,Management: Corporate World Recruits Generals --- Their leadership skills are seen as suited to the 'fog of business'; the Battle of Gettysburg as a teaching tool," Aug 30, 2017",51.74,1,"At companies across America, generals are bringing battlefield lessons to business. Software maker Red Hat Inc. and computer-security firm Symantec Corp. are among the employers turning to generals for help on numerous fronts, from corporate governance to grappling with cyberwarfare. At not-for-profit Florida Hospital, a retired general is developing global partnerships and leadership talent, while Finland's Cargotec Oyj has one running its rough-terrain-equipment unit in Texas.Military brass have gained clout in the White House, too. Often referring to them as ""my generals,"" the president has tapped a trio of leaders to impose order and shape his national-security policy. Retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly swiftly brought a forceful management style to his job as the president's new chief of staff, staffers say, while both Republicans and Democrats see Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, also a retired Marine Corps general, and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, an Army lieutenant general, as calming forces in a turbulent presidency. Discipline, though, is only one of the traits companies say military leaders bring to boards and management teams. In the fog of war, and in peacetime, generals are trained to anticipate unknown risks, build high-functioning teams and make quick, strategic decisions in high-pressure situations. ""They are the same traits necessary in the fog of business,"" says Henry Stoever, a captain in the Marine Corps who is now chief marketing officer of the National Association of Corporate Directors. The group has put some 500 retired generals and admirals through a three-day course to prepare them for corporate board duty; half of them now sit on private and public boards, including those of Wells Fargo & Co., USA Truck Inc. and aerospace supplier Wesco Aircraft Holdings Inc. Companies, especially those in crisis, covet the reputational boost that comes from seeking the counsel of a former military leader, says Wendy Monsen, president of executive recruiter Korn/Ferry's federal-government practice. Whereas more than three-quarters of Americans trust the military to act in the public's interest, according to a 2016 Pew Research Center survey, only 41% feel the same way about business leaders. For companies seeking cybersecurity skills or geopolitical know-how, ""general officers end up on our short list quite a bit for industry clients,"" says Ms. Monsen. However, outside the defense industry, military brass remain rare in c-suites and boardrooms. The number of top executives who once served has shrunk over the decades as Vietnam War-era veterans have retired. Among S&P 500 firms, only 13 are led by former service members, and just under 5% of their combined board members are veterans, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data."
Wells Fargo,Wells Fargo Raises Its Tally of Fake Accounts," Sep 1, 2017",52.35,0,"Wells Fargo & Co. said its sales-practices scandal was far broader than it had previously acknowledged, ensuring that the bank will continue to face scrutiny about a problem that has weighed on it for nearly a year.Wells Fargo said Thursday that 3.5 million ""potentially unauthorized"" customer accounts were opened as a result of improper sales tactics, a 67% increase over the 2.1 million figure it made public last fall.The disclosure, made at the conclusion of a review of the misconduct, comes against a backdrop of fresh missteps within Wells Fargo's consumer-lending operations and significant underperformance in the stock market compared with its big-bank peers.The sales scandal erupted last September when the San Francisco bank admitted that employees opened customer accounts using fictitious or unauthorized information to meet lofty sales goals. The revelation led to congressional hearings, the abrupt retirement of its then-CEO and a decision by the bank's board to claw back tens of millions of dollars in compensation from some top executives.Wells Fargo said Thursday that it is providing $3.7 million in additional customer refunds as a result of the revised count of fake accounts.""We apologize to everyone who was harmed by unacceptable sales practices that occurred in our retail bank,"" Wells Fargo Chief Executive Timothy Sloan said in a statement. ""Today's announcement is a reminder of the disappointment we caused to customers and stakeholders,"" he added on a media call.The latest disclosure is likely to keep the bank in the regulatory spotlight and boost the possibility of future congressional hearings, analyst Jaret Seiberg of Cowen Group Inc. wrote in a client note.Although Wells Fargo agreed to a $185 million settlement with regulators last September, the sales-practices issues have sparked a number of federal and state investigations, including from the Justice Department.Mr. Sloan, who took over from John Stumpf late last year, said on the media call that there aren't any updates on those investigations. The bank has said it is cooperating with the inquiries; Mr. Sloan declined to comment on conversations with regulators in light of its latest update. He also said the new account figures aren't likely to upend an agreement to pay $142 million to customers to settle a class-action suit.Soon after the bank's announcement, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D, Mass.), a frequent Wells Fargo critic, wrote on Twitter that the latest information is ""unbelievable"" and that the bank's ""massive fraud is even worse than we thought.""She reiterated her earlier call for the Federal Reserve to remove all Wells Fargo board members who served during the problem periods and for further congressional hearings.The bank's board has said the practices leading to the unauthorized accounts went as far back as 2002.Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee had already called for such hearings to examine issues that have recently emerged at the bank in regard to insurance products. So far, Republicans, who control both houses of Congress and committee leadership posts, haven't said if they would agree to the request.Mr. Sloan said Thursday that the bank is continuing to reach out to all stakeholders and ""respond to questions and concerns that they have.""The bank called the completion of the review, conducted by an unnamed third party, ""an important milestone,"" a view echoed by others. The fact that Wells Fargo is putting the scandal behind it ""is a positive in our view,"" wrote Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl, adding that ""we now expect the trickle of new information to slow considerably.""Still, many investors remain wary. Wells Fargo's stock fell Thursday, lagging behind peers.That continued a woeful period since the scandal unfolded. Over the past year, the bank's shares are barely changed. Meanwhile, its three big-bank rivals -- J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. -- have notched an average gain for the period of around 40%.

Sanger and two other directors this year, according to new regulatory filings.Following Wells Fargo's sales-practices scandal, the firm's shareholders voted in April to keep all 15 directors but did so in some cases by slim margins. Vanguard's regulatory filings show that it voted against the election of Enrique Hernandez, Jr., head of the bank's risk committee, and Frederico F. Pena as well as Mr. Sanger.The bank said Aug. 15 that former Federal Reserve governor Elizabeth Duke would replace Mr. Sanger on Jan. 1.The decision by Vanguard came before Wells Fargo on Thursday said that a review had found an additional million customer accounts that were potentially implicated in its sales-practices scandal. The bank had initially disclosed 2.1 million accounts were affected but now says more than 3.5 million accounts were ""potentially unauthorized.""The vote against Wells Fargo's directors is just one example of the increasing power of Vanguard.Vanguard has become one of the largest firms in investing thanks to the growth of products such as exchange-traded funds that track the performance of indexes but often come at a lower cost than traditional mutual funds. That growth has made Vanguard and its competitor BlackRock Inc. two of the largest shareholders in the world and given both increasing sway on shareholder votes.BlackRock voted against the re-election of seven Wells Fargo directors including Mr. Sanger, according to a separate regulatory filing. The New York money manager runs iShares, the largest ETF business.State Street Global Advisors, which also has a large ETF business, voted against the election of one Wells Fargo director.As they have grown, these firms with large index-fund businesses have come under pressure from investors to take stances on a range of issues.In addition to Wells Fargo, Vanguard this year backed more board-related shareholder proposals than last year, voting for them 47% of the time in 2017. That is up from 17% in 2016, according to a report the firm issued Thursday. The index-fund giant supported resolutions concerning issues such as the number of directors."
Wells Fargo,REVIEW --- Play: News Quiz," Sep 2, 2017",54.13,1,"Many of Wall Street's largest banks paid BlackRock Inc. for help in passing the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests last year, but not J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. A campaign to fill that gap is part of a cross-selling push at the world's largest money manager.BlackRock has spent much of the past year trying to interest J.P. Morgan, a big trading partner and technology client, in the services of a small business known as Financial Markets Advisory, according to people familiar with the effort. That unit has struggled to match the money it made after the 2008 financial crisis, when it assisted banks with a variety of regulatory and financial headaches.BlackRock's embrace of cross-selling demonstrates how the giant money manager is using its expanding heft and reach in the financial world.Top executives targeted J.P. Morgan partly because of theexisting relationship between the two financial giants. BlackRock is also J.P. Morgan's second-largest shareholder. Several meetings have yet to result in a new assignment, the people said.It is unclear why J.P. Morgan hasn't hired the firm in that capacity. A spokesman for the bank declined to comment.BlackRock is well positioned to sell multiple products to its customers because it has a wider range of services than many rivals and has interlocking relationships with many of the world's largest financial firms as one of their largest shareholders and clients. A growing internal program helps coordinate interaction between the firm's businesses and its large existing clients.The New York company is now triple the size it was during the financial crisis, with $5.69 trillion in assets under management. That surge is due largely to a string of acquisitions and an unprecedented investor shift to lower-cost, passively managed funds that track market indexes.The growth of cheaper funds has put pressure on revenue, prompting BlackRock to pitch existing clients on other business lines like advisory work and technology where it can collect extra fees. BlackRock also is searching for ways to replace revenue lost to the decline of traditional pension plans and aging baby boomers who are withdrawing their life savings from retirement plans.The company's revenue dropped about 2% in 2016, although many rivals experienced deeper drops, and BlackRock's revenue rose 5.7% during this year's second quarter to $2.97 billion.""The biggest fear asset managers have right now is not necessarily gaining new clients because industry growth is flattening out; it's losing the ones they already have,"" said Ben Phillips, principal at Casey Quirk, a Deloitte Consulting LLP practice focused on the asset-management industry."
Wells Fargo,BlackRock Pushes Cross-Selling --- The world's biggest money manager seeks to use growing heft in pursuit of business," Sep 5, 2017",52.08,0,"U.S. banks have been employing the same cross-selling strategy for decades, using it to justify waves of mergers that created national giants that sell everything from mortgages to wealth management to credit cards.Some have attracted scrutiny for more-aggressive tactics. Employees at Wells Fargo & Co., in efforts to reach lofty sales goals, opened as many as 2.1 million accounts without customers' knowledge, sparking public and political outcries as well as numerous investigations. Wells Fargo updated that number Thursday, saying around 3.5 million accounts were ""potentially unauthorized.""BlackRock doesn't sell money-management products directly to individuals. Instead it works with large companies and financial firms, some of which market BlackRock's funds to investors. It also offers those firms technology, regulatory and risk-management advice, giving BlackRock several chances to sell additional services to the same clients. Its cross-selling approach worked early last year in the case of St. Louis money manager Ascension Investment Management.The company hired BlackRock, which already managed some of its assets, to help it move $125 million out of a fixed-income fund and invest in other asset classes. It exchanged two-thirds of the roughly 1,200 bonds it held in the fund for shares in three iShares fixed-income exchange traded funds also offered by BlackRock, Ascension Investment executives said.Another cross sale happened in July when a customer of BlackRock's risk management and technology system, Arizona State's University's endowment, hired BlackRock to take on an additional role as the organization's chief investment officer.The internal group at the center of many of these cross-selling efforts at BlackRock is known as the strategic partner program and helps manage relationships between the firm and big clients. The program includes about 100 of the firm's biggest clients including sovereign-wealth funds and pension funds such as the Teacher Retirement System of Texas as well as banks including Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG, the people said"
Wells Fargo,Automation's Surprise Benefit: More Jobs --- E-commerce more than compensates for layoffs by traditional retailers," Sep 6, 2017",52.53,1,"For retailers, the robot apocalypse isn't a science-fiction movie. As digital giants swallow a growing share of shoppers' spending, thousands of stores have closed and tens of thousands of workers have lost their jobs.Belinda Duperre, who sold jewelry at Sam's Club in Fall River, Mass., was one. In early 2016, the struggling store closed.But Ms. Duperre, a lifelong resident of the once-thriving factory town an hour south of Boston, went from victim of the digital revolution to beneficiary. Amazon.com Inc. announced plans to hire 500 full-time workers for a new 1.2-million square foot fulfillment center on the outskirts of town. ""I was just dying, waiting for Amazon to open,"" she recalls. She was among the center's first hires last fall; full-time employment has since soared to about 2,000.Ms. Duperre earns $2 more per hour at Amazon than at Sam's, in part because she's a lot more productive. At Sam's, she served perhaps one to 20 customers a day. At Amazon, she packs 75 to 120 boxes an hour that are then whisked via high-speed automated conveyor belts to fleets of trucks that fan out across the region. The work is more physically demanding, but Ms. Duperre, 54, sees a bright side. ""I lost 25 pounds working here,"" she says. ""This is a free gym membership.""The brick-and-mortar retail swoon has been accompanied by a less headline-grabbing e-commerce boom that has created more jobs in the U.S. than traditional stores have cut. Those jobs, in turn, pay better, because its workers are so much more productive.This demonstrates something routinely overlooked in the anxiety about the job-destroying potential of robots, artificial intelligence and other forms of automation. Throughout history, automation commonly creates more, and better-paying, jobs than it destroys. The reason: Companies don't use automation simply to produce the same thing more cheaply. Instead, they find ways to offer entirely new, improved products. As customers flock to these new offerings, companies have to hire more people.""Robot apocalypse"" is a modern expression, but the underlying anxiety goes back centuries. In 1589 Queen Elizabeth I refused to grant the inventor of a mechanical knitting machine a patent for fear of putting manual knitters out of work. In 1930 the British economist John Maynard Keynes warned of ""technological unemployment . . . due to our discovery of means of economizing the use of labor outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labor.""Those fears have repeatedly proven baseless. James Bessen, an economist at Boston University School of Law, has found in numerous episodes when technology was supposed to annihilate jobs, the opposite occurred. After the first automated tellers were installed in the 1970s, an executive at Wells, Fargo & Co. predicted ATMs would lead to fewer branches with even fewer staff. And indeed, the average branch used one-third fewer workers in 2004 than in 1988. But, Mr. Bessen found, ATMs made it much cheaper to operate a branch so banks opened more: Total branches rose 43% over that time.Today, banks employ more tellers than in 1980 and their duties have expanded to things ATMs can't do such as ""relationship banking.""Mr. Bessen witnessed this sort of transformation personally. In 1983 he created an early desktop publishing program, which made typesetting and graphical design vastly simpler and cheaper. Shortly after Sears purchased his program in 1989, its catalog operation laid off 100 employees, he recalls, and he worried, ""are we shafting a bunch of people with this product?""But some customers used his software to increase the number and variety of their publications. The supermarket chain A&P used Mr. Bessen's software to publish 30 or 40 versions of its weekly circular for Atlanta, with different promotions aimed at different neighborhoods. Mr. Bessen found that typesetting and compositor jobs fell about 100,000 over the 1980s, but from 1979 to 2007 the number of designers more than quadrupled to 800,000, making up for the loss many times over.The process is still disruptive, of course: The people thrown out of work by automation are seldom the same people employed in the new industries that automation makes possible. But over time, the net effect is consistently positive.Retail is easily the largest U.S. industry now facing digital disruption and yet there is strong evidence e-commerce hasn't reduced overall employment and has likely added to it. It is true that thousands of stores have closed. Between the end of 2007 and the middle of 2017, brick-and-mortar retailers lost the equivalent of 140,000 full-time jobs, according to a forthcoming report by Michael Mandel, chief economic strategist at the Progressive Policy Institute, a think tank. Electronic shopping jobs rose by only 126,000 in the same period.But, Mr. Mandel notes, that excludes many jobs at fulfillment centers such as Fall River, which the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics tends to count in warehousing and storage. He notes that Kentucky had just 3,213 e-commerce workers in 2016 according to the BLS, yet Amazon employs more than 12,000 there. Warehousing has added 274,000 jobs nationwide since 2007. Mr. Mandel argues all of those are attributable to fulfillment centers and that thus total e-commerce employment has grown 401,000, nearly three times the brick-and-mortar drop. Mr. Mandel finds that fulfillment centers pay on average 31% better than brick and mortar stores in the same county."
Wells Fargo,Plots &amp;amp; Ploys," Sep 6, 2017",54.79,1,"When a crate of frying pans arrives, employees don't stack them in a designated shelf for frying pans. Rather, they stow each pan individually wherever it fits. Each pan's location is scanned into Amazon's inventory and becomes instantly available to any customer on the internet. When a customer orders the frying pan, Amazon's software searches across the company's more than 70 fulfillment centers for the one that can be delivered most cheaply, or most quickly. If it is located at the top of one of the 34-foot tall storage racks in a particular aisle of this center, the order shows up on the scanning gun of the nearest ""picker."" The picker's forklift, guided by sensors communicating with wires in the floor, will lift him or her to the precise bin where the object is located.Pickers transport those items in metal cages to the packing area, where computers tell packers precisely which size box to use, or transmits its dimensions to other devices that cut boxes out to customized size. Once packed by Ms. Duperre and her colleagues, a box flies down a conveyor belt, over a scale that double checks its weight and contents, then under a scanner that prints and affixes a delivery label. Several hundred feet and a few seconds later, the boxes are automatically nudged off the conveyor belt in front of the truck destined for the customer's town.Humans are used throughout the process in what are often physically demanding activities, but Amazon's technology vastly multiplies how many items each can pick, pack and ship, all of which shaves minutes and costs off delivery. Incremental improvements and a growing network of fulfillment centers filter through to customers such as the ability to order as late as 11:59 p.m. and still qualify for two-day delivery.It isn't skilled work, and the wages reflect that. The starting salary at Fall River is $13.05 to $13.55 per hour. But including overtime, the Amazon shares every new employee receives, and benefits such as tuition aid, annual compensation is comparable to what local textile mills once paid, according to Kenneth Fiola, executive vice president of the city's economic development office. It is also more than traditional retail, which typically pays the state minimum wage of $11.""The vast majority of our workforce never had experience in a warehouse, never had any experience driving a forklift or powered industrial equipment, and we provide them that skill and training, we teach them the new retail,"" says Andrew Sweatman, general manager at the fulfillment center.Like Ms. Duperre, Tarrah Tripp also used to work in retail, as a cake decorator at a family-run grocery. At Amazon, she operates custom box-cutting machinery for awkwardly shaped items. It isn't high-tech, but it uses more technology than her last job, she says, ""unless you think cutting bread is technology intensive."" The pay is a bit better and she gets a full week's worth of hours in four days, which gives her three days off every week. She doesn't intend to spend her career here, and soon plans to train as a veterinary technician, for which Amazon will help pay the tuition."

Combined, the two managed about 3,500 people, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.A Wells Fargo spokesman said Tuesday that the bank ""denies the allegations of these two former regional presidents. The termination decisions were not retaliatory as alleged in the complaint. The company terminated the employment of these two individuals for legitimate and lawful reasons.""Wells Fargo was ordered to pay a $185 million fine last year over its sales practices and has since faced public and political pressure as the scandal erupted. More than 5,300 employees were fired over a five-year period for the behavior. The bank said last week that up to 3.5 million customer accounts may have been unauthorized.The lawsuit alleges that Mr. Razzaghipour reported one type of employee fraud in 2013 and fired a ""significant number of employees involved."" The lawsuit also alleges that Mrs. Razzaghipour, known to some at work as Marla Clemow, ""reported the illegal and unethical sales practices at the highest levels multiple times.""Both former managers ""never fired or disciplined anyone for failing to meet the bank's impossible and fraudulent sales goals,"" the lawsuit claimed.But some current and former employees and managers have told the Journal that Mr. and Mrs. Razzaghipour pushed them to engage in questionable sales tactics.""My clients were fired in retaliation for complaining of illegal conduct at Wells Fargo, including the bank's improper sales practices,"" said the managers' lawyer, Emanuel Shirazi, of Los Angeles-based Shirazi Law Firm.

Wells Fargo,"A Year Later, Wells Fargo Woes Persist"," Sep 9, 2017",55.9,0,"A year after Wells Fargo & Co.'s sales-practices scandal erupted, the bank has changed its leadership and lost valuable ground to rivals. Yet executives still face an array of legal challenges that may take months if not years to sort out.In recent weeks, the Justice Department has conducted interviews with executives in the bank's San Francisco headquarters, according to people familiar with the matter. The agency last fall began its investigation into the bank's practices after Wells Fargo entered into a regulatory settlement Sept. 8 over the widespread opening of accounts at the bank without customers' knowledge. Wells Fargo has been cooperating with that investigation.Last week, Wells Fargo increased its tally of accounts opened due to improper sales tactics to 3.5 million from the 2.1 million initially made public last fall.The 67% increase in the fake accounts brought renewed focus to the scandal, which badly bruised the bank's reputation, led to the abrupt retirement of its then CEO, and prompted many federal and state investigations separate from that of the Justice Department.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are both probing consumer-lending issues at the bank that have only recently come to light. Those inquiries are in the early stages, people familiar with them said, and involve insurance products sold by the bank's auto-lending business.The insurance issues have led Senate Democrats to call for congressional hearings, which could open up the bank and Chief Executive Timothy Sloan to renewed negative publicity. Last fall, then-CEO John Stumpf was skewered during hearings examining the sales-practices problems and abruptly retired soon after.On another front, Wells Fargo is negotiating with the Justice Department in the hope of reaching a settlement related to crisis-era sales of mortgage-backed securities. Any deal could represent a charge of more than $1 billion to the bank, according to people familiar with the talks.Although other big U.S. and European banks have reached settlements amounting to billions of dollars, Wells Fargo has so far avoided such a hit. The issue is likely to come to the fore for the bank in the next several weeks, the people said.A Wells Fargo spokesman said the bank has made changes to its executive leadership, business model, organizational structure and compensation system over the past year, among other areas. He said the bank continues to seek out areas of improvement and keep shareholders informed."
Wells Fargo,"Wealth Management (A Special Report) --- A New Kind of Volunteering, Encouraged by the Boss: Companies let their workers donate their professional expertise -- on company time"," Sep 11, 2017",56.83,1,"As a research-and-development engineer at General Mills Inc., Madison Barre spends most of her workweek developing products for the Minneapolis-based food company. She also devotes about one to three hours, on average, plus some personal time, doing pro-bono work for small food companies in Africa.The 27-year-old Ms. Barre (who also has worked as a quality engineer at General Mills) has shared tips on how to reduce contamination risk when handling raw ingredients and has offered guidance on subjects such as organizational management. While most of this consulting work is done via videoconferencing, in January she traveled to a Malawi production plant to provide food-safety guidance and simulated audits ahead of an actual inspection to assess the plant's processes and quality.""It's incredibly rewarding not only for the clients and seeing their progress but for your own skill development,"" says Ms. Barre, adding that this type volunteerism allows her to flex her professional muscles in ways her regular day job doesn't always allow.While corporate volunteer programs are nothing new -- employees have long taken part in things such as food drives and home-building initiatives -- projects that allow workers to donate their professional expertise are a different, and growing, breed. More than one million hours of pro-bono work were performed last year, up from 492,305 hours in 2013, according to a survey of more than 270 publicly traded companies by CECP, a nonprofit consulting firm whose mission is to help companies do good.The rise coincides with growth in the number of employers sponsoring pro-bono service programs. Many companies see these initiatives as a way to attract and retain professionals who desire more purposeful careers. ""Increasingly, employees don't just want to paint fences,"" says Carmen Perez, CECP's director of data insights. ""They want to use their skills . . . to solve a societal challenge.""Millennials, in particular, have an interest in far-reaching social issues and typically want opportunities to give back to their communities in ways that are personal to them, according to the latest Millennial Impact Report, an annual study supported by the Case Foundation and conducted by Achieve, a research and marketing agency. In the 2015 report, 77% of millennials said they were more likely to volunteer when they could use their specific skills or expertise to benefit a cause.Experts say it's important to differentiate pro-bono volunteering from traditional volunteering, where individuals perform work for which they normally wouldn't charge. Pro-bono programs, by contrast, typically involve people providing a professional service -- such as legal, accounting or financial-planning advice -- to a formally organized nonprofit at no cost.From a tax perspective, certain out-of-pocket expenses incurred by either a company or individual while donating pro-bono work are deductible. These may include travel, lodging and supply costs, though in order for expenses to qualify for a deduction they need to primarily benefit the charity -- not an individual or a business, says Joshua Zimmelman, president of New York-based Westwood Tax & Consulting."

The real gift is to consumers who have been bilked again and again by big banks and predatory payday lenders. We just learned that Wells Fargo defrauded millions more customers than it originally told us. Without the CFPB's rule, none of those millions would ever get their day in court. In fact, Wells Fargo has cited its arbitration clause to avoid ever being held accountable in a court of law. It's easy to demonize advocates who help consumers get justice. It's harder to justify giving banks a ""get out of jail free"" card, which is what Mr. Frank is proposing the Senate do. Any vote to kill the CFPB's rule should be called what it really is: The Wells Fargo Immunity Act."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Goldman Bolsters Its Staff in Lending Area," Sep 14, 2017",57.56,1,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is poaching about 20 employees from online small-business lender Bond Street Marketplace Inc. as the Wall Street giant embraces loans as a source of growth, according to people familiar with the move.The group -- a mix of engineers, product developers and risk and marketing specialists -- will join Goldman's growing consumer bank in the wake of Bond Street's recent decision to stop making new loans, according to the people.Founded in 2013, Bond Street offered one- to three-year term loans to companies of up to $1 million. It grew to about 35 employees and raised at least $10 million through share sales to investors including venture-capital firm Spark Capital, Airbnb co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk and celebrity chef David Chang. (Goldman wasn't an investor.)Recently though, Bond Street has faced challenges raising a new round of equity, which contributed to its decision to pause lending and run off its existing portfolio, one of the people familiar with the matter said. The company's outstanding loan portfolio will continue to be serviced as it pursues its next steps.Bond Street's emphasis on technology fits well with Goldman's criteria as it surveys new lending opportunities. On Tuesday, Goldman said it expects lending to account for nearly half of $5 billion in revenue growth by 2020 -- a notable shift for a firm that long shied away from credit businesses.Last year, the firm launched Marcus, an online consumer-lending business. It has reorganized a few hundred employees into a new division, Consumer and Commercial Banking, tasked with developing new lending products.Goldman has looked outside for new talent, tapping a marketing chief from underwear brand Jockey International, a former Leo Burnett advertising executive to develop online content and personal bankers from Wells Fargo & Co.Bond Street's loans have performed well enough that it was able to raise a $300 million line of credit from investment-bank Jefferies Group LLC in February. Its automated underwriting process includes traditional inputs such as entrepreneurs' personal credit scores and their businesses' financial statements, but it also pulls in data from social networks and other sources used to fight fraud."
Wells Fargo,Treasurys Inch Down After Inflation Data," Sep 15, 2017",58.02,1,"U.S. government-bond prices weakened for a fourth consecutive day after a key measure of consumer prices rose in August.The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note edged up to 2.199%, from 2.194% on Wednesday, notching its longest streak of increases since early July. Yields rise as bond prices fall.Yields initially spiked after Labor Department data showed that U.S. consumer prices rose last month at the strongest pace since January. The consumer-price index ticked up 0.4% in August from the prior month, spurred by an increase in gasoline prices after Hurricane Harvey caused a temporary shutdown in Texas refineries.The latest data could be a sign that inflation is picking up after months of weakness, and arrives ahead of the Federal Reserve's scheduled meeting next week to contemplate the future path of interest rates. Inflation is a threat to government-bond prices because it erodes the purchasing power of their fixed payments and makes it more likely the Fed will raise interest rates.In one signal that the market's expectations for long-term inflation is slightly higher than it was several weeks ago, the 10-year break-even rate -- the yield premium of the 10-year Treasury note to the 10-year Treasury inflation-protected security -- was roughly 1.85 percentage points on Thursday, according Tradeweb. That indicates investors expect an annual inflation rate of 1.85% over the next decade, up from around 1.66% in June.Thursday's data initially lifted optimism about the inflation picture, but a separate Labor Department report showing Americans' average weekly earnings fell 0.6% in August from a month earlier may have damped investors' enthusiasm, said George Rusnak, co-head of global fixed-income strategy for Wells Fargo Investment Institute.""The income data is an important component of inflation,"" Mr. Rusnak said.Other data from the Labor Department showed that the number of Americans applying for new unemployment benefits fell last week, while remaining higher than two weeks ago, because of the impact of Hurricane Harvey.Given the recent storms' potential influence on economic data, Mr. Rusnak said that he is taking Thursday's measures ""with a grain of salt."""
Wells Fargo,"In Depth: The Flip Side of the New U.S. Economy --- Millions of contractors struggle for career advancement, stability and respect at work"," Sep 15, 2017",58.23,1,"Michael Preiss was happy to escape the corporate grind after being laid off by International Business Machines Corp. in 2001. He became a contractor, earning more than $100,000 a year from steady assignments helping companies figure out how to do things faster and cheaper.That work eventually dried up. The past decade has been a revolving door of outsourced jobs for shrinking pay, fear that any day at a company could be his last, and reminders that full-time employees live in a different world, even though they often sit at the next desk. Mr. Preiss says a manager reprimanded him because co-workers complained that he laughed too loudly.""My career is shot,"" says Mr. Preiss, 59 years old, who lives in Atlanta. ""There just is no career anymore.""Millions of contractors now do heavy lifting, paper pushing and other jobs for American companies that have replaced employees with outside workers. Within the next four years, nearly half of the private-sector workforce in the U.S. will have spent at least some time as a contractor, temporary employee or other type of outside job, estimates MBO Partners, a provider of support services to self-employed professionals.The contractor model offers companies lower costs, more flexibility and fewer management headaches. Workers get far less from the arrangement. The costs hit home in every paycheck and every day on the job, according to interviews with dozens of current and former contractors, as well as many of the more than 150 responses to a survey by The Wall Street Journal. The survey asks readers to describe their experiences as a contractor.Outside workers usually aren't surprised when they get no paid holidays, sick days, employee-sponsored health insurance, 401(k) plan or other perks offered to traditional employees at the same companies.What wounds more deeply are things taken for granted or barely considered at all by regular employees, outside workers often say. The work lives of contractors frequently feel like tiny slights that reinforce their second-class status and bruise their self-worth. Even when contracting jobs are easy to get, they can vanish instantly, and turning contract assignments into a real career remains out of reach.At many companies, contractors aren't allowed to attend important meetings, go to the company gym or bring their kids to Take Your Child to Work Day. They keep quiet because only full-time employees are expected to speak up. Working harder, smarter or longer offers little advantage when applying for a job directly with the company.Nothing is loathed more than the nametags or identification badges that advertise the lowly ranking of contractors in the workplace pecking order. Technical writer Don Cwiklowski Jr. worked as a contractor at Mastercard Inc. for four years. He says co-workers often glanced at the badge dangling from his neck, saw the red color that signaled his contractor status and looked right past him."
Wells Fargo,The Fed Should Stop Worrying and Learn to Love Low Inflation," Sep 18, 2017",56.72,1,"There's no excuse for the Federal Reserve's dawdling -- not even its obsessive concern that inflation is too low. At 1.4% year on year as of July, core inflation is below the Fed's target of 2%, but that goal is arbitrary and unrealistic for today's economy. When the Federal Open Market Committee meets this week it should put aside this inflation fixation and raise interest rates, which have been dangerously low for much too long.The current economic recovery has been the slowest in recent times, despite the lowest interest rates in history for the longest time. Easy money has benefited mainly the wealthy, while average consumers have been getting close to zero interest on their savings accounts. This is particularly tough for retirees who do not participate in the stock market.Low inflation, on the other hand, has been good for the U.S. economy, workers and the middle class, including retirees living on fixed incomes. Over the past five years, hourly earnings in the private workforce are up 2.2% a year on average, which is only about half of what might be expected in a normal economic recovery. But thanks to low inflation, workers have gained some real income.If the Fed had been successful in achieving its 2% inflation target, it would have offset nearly all these wage gains. That in turn would have severely weakened the annual growth of consumer spending, which, at over 3%, is a bright spot in the economy.Higher inflation does not create greater economic growth. To the contrary, it is greater economic growth that can lead to higher inflation. Therefore, the Fed ought to be focused on revving the economy and adding jobs -- period. One reason business investment has been very weak for eight years is the lack of confidence in Washington's monetary and fiscal policies.The only legitimate reason to increase inflation artificially is to avoid deflation, which can indeed be dangerous. If consumers become convinced that prices will drop over time, they begin to postpone purchases, thereby slowing economic growth.But to find out if this is happening, the metric to look at isn't inflation. It is the savings rate. If consumers have money and don't spend it, then obviously the savings rate must go up. There is no evidence that it has done so to any significant degree world-wide. In the U.S., the opposite is occurring: The savings rate slid to 3.5% as of July, down from 5.1% a year earlier.As long as the economy and employment continue to improve, the Fed should stop fretting about low inflation and move to normalize monetary policy. Ideally it could reach interest rates of at least 2% by the middle of next year, up from 1.25% today. That would be a good middle ground. If economic growth then slowed, the Fed would have room to maneuver by ticking rates down. But if inflation increased, it could quickly raise rates to the equilibrium level.The Fed should also start, at the FOMC meeting this week, reducing its outsize balance sheet, so as to let the markets begin to function properly. Before the recession of 2008-09, the Federal Reserve's balance sheet had never reached $1 trillion. Today it stands at $4.5 trillion, or 25% of Washington's entire public debt. The Fed's eight-year intervention in the markets has helped push asset prices -- including the stock market, long-term bonds, and at least some commercial real estate -- so high as to raise concerns of a bubble. Should it burst, the effects could be catastrophic, shattering confidence in the economy. The Fed would feel pressure once again to bail out the wealthy with monetary policies that artificially support risky assets.The incomes of many Americans are flat or declining, and thousands who want work still cannot find a decent job. What built this country's prosperity was the unparalleled success of America's free-market system. If the Fed wants to help, it should forget its inflation worries, get out of the way, and let the markets operate."
Wells Fargo,"BofA's Rural Branch Exodus --- Bank shut 1,600 sites since financial crisis as it shifted from 'bigger is better' tack"," Sep 18, 2017",56.6,1,"Bank of America Corp. pulled all of its branches out of Indiana four years ago when it sold off a group of antiquated storefronts in Rust Belt towns. Later this year, the lender is returning but this time is targeting affluent customers in the state's largest city, Indianapolis.The Charlotte, N.C., bank, the nation's second-largest lender, has closed about 1,600 branches since the financial crisis as it sought to rekindle sagging profits and focus on major metropolitan areas. The reductions are roughly equivalent to shutting all the Citigroup Inc. and Capital One Financial Corp. outlets in the U.S.The strategy would represent a stark change for any big lender, but it is a particularly striking departure for a bank built over decades on the idea of offering a coast-to-coast network in areas both urban and rural. ""Bigger is indeed better,"" former Chief Executive Hugh McColl said when the bank was formed in 1998 by the merger of NationsBank Corp. and BankAmerica Corp.But strains from the financial crisis led to a different approach. In 2009, the bank had branches in 725 U.S. counties, roughly one out of every four nationwide. In 2016, it was in 253 fewer counties, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of bank regulator data.The bank has in recent years cut branches far more aggressively than J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. or Wells Fargo & Co., the two other U.S. banks with the most branches, according to the analysis. However, Wells Fargo, which had branches in more than 900 counties in 2016, may soon be taking a page from Bank of America's playbook. Seeking to bolster its bottom line after its sales-practices scandal, Wells Fargo in May announced plans to close about 450 of its roughly 6,000 branches in 2017 and 2018.Bank of America no longer has a branch in places like Elkhart, Ind.; Dodge City, Kan., and Florence, S.C. In the Utica, N.Y., area, where there were 12 branches in 2009, there are now none.""You can't be everywhere,"" said Dean Athanasia, co-head of the bank's consumer unit, in an interview. Nevertheless, he said the bank's footprint, with 4,542 branches, covers 80% of the U.S. population. ""I don't think we were optimally positioned before.""In most counties the bank left, it sold at least some of its branches to smaller lenders, limiting the effect on those communities. In nearly one-quarter of the counties, Bank of America simply closed the branches, directing customers to other locations, sometimes dozens of miles away.Meanwhile, Bank of America is opening new branches in a number of big metropolitan areas where it previously didn't have them, a rare move for a big bank in recent years.With its emphasis on more urban markets, the bank in part is adapting to demographic changes.Many rural areas have struggled with population decline and lower male labor-force participation as highly educated young workers flock to urban centers. But the bank also is grappling with the fallout of the financial crisis. New restrictions on overdraft fees also hit consumer-banking revenue, and a determination to avoid the mistakes of the subprime era led to a new focus on creditworthy customers.Branches have also lost much of their reason to exist because routine transactions such as depositing checks and transferring money are increasingly done on computers or phones. Banks can't get rid of branches altogether, however, because many customers still pick their bank based on whether it has a nearby branch. Important product sales still happen there."
Wells Fargo,Business News: Sears Canada Gets Private-Equity Interest," Sep 18, 2017",57.07,0,"Sears Canada Inc.'s top executive is negotiating a private-equity-backed deal for a slimmed-down version of the insolvent retailer, according to people familiar with the matter.The proposed offer could be valued at more than 650 million Canadian dollars ($533 million) and would slash the company's store footprint by more than half, people familiar with the matter said. But it could preserve at least 8,000 jobs while paying off bankruptcy loans provided by Wells Fargo Capital Finance Corp. and GACP Finance Co., these people said.The company's executive chairman, Brandon Stranzl, told employees last month he was preparing an offer designed to save at least part of Sears Canada from liquidation. It filed for protection from creditors in June under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act -- Canada's equivalent of chapter 11 bankruptcy -- after operating at a loss since 2014.His deal would be financed partly through private-equity capital sourced by Vadim Perelman, the founder of Los Angeles-based Baker Street Capital Management, and partly with debt financing, people familiar with the matter said.The restructured Sears Canada would assume liabilities associated with employees and retail leases, some of which may be renegotiated, they said. A Sears Canada spokesman declined to comment.Any sale agreement would require court approval. Mr. Stranzl's proposed terms are still under negotiation but could keep roughly 70 Sears Canada locations open, the people said.Interested parties had until Aug. 31 to submit business plans or liquidation offers for all or part of the company. Of more than 200 locations, liquidators are already shutting down 54. The viability of Mr. Stranzl's bid depends on whether a court-appointed monitor believes the remaining stores are worth more open or closed.The company, spun off from its U.S. namesake Sears Holdings Corp. in 2012, struggled to tap into the Canadian market while competing with online retailers and entrenched Canadian outlets. Sears Canada said in court papers it struggled with the ""general weakening of the traditional Canadian retail industry"" and the declining Canadian dollar on top of a deteriorating catalog business."

Some 40% of the company's revenue comes from areas affected by the storms.Mr. St. Juste said he expected other national home builders to be affected as well, including.A New York investment firm has put $127.5 million of new debt on a Pittsburgh office complex that has roots dating back to a misguided urban renewal project of the 1960s.Faros Properties LLC borrowed the money, backing it primarily with Nova Place, which was converted from a failing 1.2 million-square-foot urban mall into office space in the early 1990s. The lender of the five-year, floating rate loan was Wells Fargo & Co., according to Holliday Fenoglio Fowler LP, which placed the debt for Faros.The deal shows that lenders still have a healthy appetite for debt backed by properties with high occupancy, strong ownership and values that are higher than the loan amounts.The new loan replaces about $65 million of Wells Fargo debt that had been on the property."

Wells Fargo,The Future of Finance (A Special Report) --- The Growing Popularity and Clout of ETF Strategists: Centrally managed portfolios have big impact on how money moves in the ETF market," Sep 25, 2017",57.31,0,"The morning after Donald Trump's surprise victory in November, BlackRock Inc. quickly sold millions of dollars of shares in an emerging-markets exchange-traded fund, sales that rippled through thousands of client accounts totaling about $1 billion.BlackRock simultaneously blasted emails out to thousands of financial advisers, explaining the change in a trade note written during stress tests conducted in the weeks leading up to the election.""We didn't think it was going to happen, but we ran the scenario and we were ready,"" says Greg Weiss, head of BlackRock's U.S. managed-accounts business. ""We knew what we were going to do and why.""Centrally managed ETF portfolios such as BlackRock's -- run by managers who invest in ETFs to maximize returns, and typically sold through financial advisers or brokerage platforms -- are becoming more popular. The bigger they get, the more influence they have on how money moves in the $3 trillion ETF marketplace. Sudden influxes of new cash, abrupt surges in trading volume and apparent turnabouts in market sentiment sometimes lead back to a handful of portfolio managers in this fast-growing corner of the industry""When you see these massive flows, it's more than likely because a manager like me has decided to make a change within their portfolios,"" says Phil Blancato, chief executive of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management Inc.No one knows how big the business is, in part because there's little agreement on how exactly to define it. Also known as ETF strategies, ETF managed accounts or ETF model portfolios, the business broadly refers to money managers who use ETFs to build investment portfolios instead of, or in addition to, individual stocks and bonds.Mark Wiedman, who runs BlackRock's iShares ETF business, estimates that as much as 12% of the $150 billion investors poured into iShares ETFs this year through the end of July came through ETF model portfolios.Morningstar Inc. counts about $100 billion invested in strategies that invest at least half of their assets in ETFs, but reporting is voluntary and excludes portfolios that don't meet that definition but still have significant ETF holdings. BlackRock reports $5 billion in ETF models that meet Morningstar's criteria, but there are additional assets in portfolios that don't, said Mr. Weiss.Morningstar also doesn't capture ETF models from big brokerage and advisory firms, many of which don't report information to the fund researcher but are big players in the market. Wells Fargo & Co., for example, has more than $20 billion in ETF portfolios, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch has more than $50 billion, both far larger than the biggest strategists reporting to Morningstar.Complicating any accounting are so-called paper portfolios, which are impossible to track. Paper portfolios refer to financial advisers who put their own spin on asset allocation, using a model as a starting point. ETF issuers like BlackRock and Vanguard offer do-it-yourself advice free because they make money by basing the portfolios on their own ETFs.Whatever it's called, the growth of actively managed ETF portfolios has turned passive investing on its head. ETFs have been growing at a record pace this year as more savers forsake active money managers in favor of low-cost index tracking funds. Yet with more than 3,000 ETFs listed in the U.S., picking the right ETFs and the right mix can be a difficult task that investors increasingly are willing to hand over to someone else."
Wells Fargo,Equifax Chief Quits Amid Hacking Crisis," Sep 27, 2017",58.41,1,"Equifax Inc. escalated its response to a massive hack ahead of congressional hearings next week, announcing Tuesday that Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Smith would step aside under an agreement that allows for compensation clawbacks.The credit-reporting company's board wanted to show Equifax and its leadership were being held accountable for the breach, according to people familiar with the matter. Equifax on Sept. 7 disclosed that the cyberattack compromised vital personal information -- names, addresses, social security numbers and dates of birth -- of potentially 143 million Americans.The attack led to a public and political outcry. It also called into question Equifax's security practices and when and whether it patched a publicly identified security vulnerability. At the same time, weaknesses in Equifax's security systems were apparent to outside observers in the months before the hack, according to several cyberrisk analysis companies.In a statement, Mr. Smith said he believed ""it is in the best interests of the company to have new leadership to move the company forward."" Mr. Smith, 57 years old, still is expected to attend the congressional hearings next week.In acting before the hearings, Equifax's board had in mind the experience of former Wells Fargo & Co. Chief Executive John Stumpf, the people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Stumpf was lambasted in congressional hearings a year ago for repeatedly refusing to say whether his position or compensation would be affected by the bank's problems. Mr. Stumpf retired soon afterward.The Equifax board was also mindful that there were already calls among some legislators for both Mr. Smith and directors to be taken to task, a person familiar with the matter said. Although Equifax's chief information and security officers retired a week after the hack was disclosed, those departures weren't viewed as significant enough, the person added.Mr. Smith, CEO since 2005, is being succeeded as chairman by current director Mark Feidler, who will serve as nonexecutive chairman, Equifax's board said. It added that Paulino do Rego Barros Jr., who was most recently Equifax's president for the Asia-Pacific region, has been appointed interim CEO.Mr. Barros was one of a handful of senior executives Mr. Smith had been grooming as a possible successor in recent years, according to people familiar with the matter.In a statement, Mr. Feidler said, ""The board remains deeply concerned about and totally focused on the cybersecurity incident. Speaking for everyone on the board, I sincerely apologize.""He added that the board has formed a special committee to focus on ""the issues arising from the incident and to ensure that all appropriate actions are taken.""This could include further action related to Mr. Smith. An agreement with the departing executive said that while he will retire, ""all decisions relating to the characterization"" of his departure will be deferred until the board completes a review. Mr. Smith won't receive an annual bonus opportunity for 2017 and the open-ended nature of his departure allows for the possibility of compensation clawbacks."

But that fell short of the S&P 500's gain of 12.5%.The performance reflected that banks stocks, after surging in the wake of last November's election, have struggled at times this year to maintain their momentum.In late August and early September, for example, bank stocks tumbled. That mirrored a drop in the yield of the 10-year Treasury, which fell to 2.04% from 2.39% in July, amid mounting hurricane concerns and rising geopolitical tensions.As hurricane damage proved to be less than the most dire projections, the yield reversed course and climbed to 2.33% by the end of the month. Bank stocks rose along with it.After dropping about 5% between early August and early September, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. bounced back by nearly 8%. The bank, the biggest in the U.S. by assets and market value, ended the quarter at a record close of $95.51 a share.The Trump administration's unveiling of a tax-overhaul plan near the end of September gave bank stocks an added fillip.The tax ""proposal is a tailwind for the sector,"" said Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investment Group, a New York-based asset manager with $3 billion under advisement. ""The banking sector depends on economic growth, and to the extent we get tax reform that flows through to better growth, that supports the stocks.""Clarity on tax policy could also spur merger activity. ""So we could see a pickup in activity that would support the advisory business of the banks,"" Mr. Benowitz added.Still, bank stocks remain tethered to interest rates; lending and trading conditions might also prove short-term drags on their performance.Some analysts have ratcheted back their expectations for banks' growth over the rest of the year. Nomura Instinet said last week that it lowered its third-quarter forecasts for big banks.Executives at the biggest firms have already signaled that trading revenue for the third quarter is likely to decline from 15% to 20% versus a year earlier.And Federal Reserve loan data also point toward softening loan growth, particularly in U.S. banks' commercial and industrial lending, which was down 0.1% from the beginning of the quarter through Sept. 20, according to analysts at Jefferies. Several analysts also noted possible declines due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.Analysts also aren't yet giving any credit for the tax proposal, even if it holds the promise of quickly boosting banks' bottom lines.""Some difficult special interest battles are ahead, suggesting Congress's true timeline for passage is longer than their currently stated goal of passage by year-end,"" wrote analysts at Morgan Stanley in a note last week.The result is that banks may be even more dependent on what is happening with interest rates. On that front, bankers expect further, gradual rises, rather than any abrupt upward lurch that could disrupt markets.""Any sort of planning starts with the environment and. . .the key word is measured,"" said Citigroup Inc. Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach, speaking to analysts in September. ""It's not that we're talking about crazy increases in interest rates.""Yet plans by the Federal Reserve to begin whittling down its balance sheet have cast uncertainty over how long-term yields will behave. More immediately, short-term yields have risen at a faster pace than long-term ones as the Fed has increased its benchmark rate.That has led to a flattening of the yield curve, which can weigh on bank profits. Banks typically generate higher profits when there is a bigger difference between short-term rates, which more closely track how much it costs for banks to gather deposits, and long-term rates, which track how much banks earn when they lend out money to home buyers or corporations."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Wells Fargo CEO's Testimony: Five Things to Know," Oct 3, 2017",59.97,0,"Wells Fargo & Co. Chief Executive Timothy Sloan has a lot riding on Tuesday morning.A couple of weeks shy of his first anniversary in the job, Mr. Sloan is set to testify for the first time as CEO in front of the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET.The last time the bank's chief did that, he was grilled over the bank's sales-practices scandal and resigned less than a month later.Mr. Sloan, who filled that void last October when former CEO John Stumpf left the bank, is expected to answer questions related to the scandal, especially updated information that the bank potentially opened 3.5 million customer accounts without the customers' knowledge, up from the initial estimate of up to 2.1 million accounts.A three-decade veteran of the bank, Mr. Sloan also likely will address more recent problems in its consumer-lending unit around certain auto-insurance charges and mortgage products.In recent weeks, the San Francisco lender has already released details about those issues, so the focus probably will be more on how Mr. Sloan reacts to the difficult questions expected from the likes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.).Wells Fargo spokeswoman Jennifer Dunn said the bank welcomes the opportunity to update the committee on steps it has taken to fix problems. But it won't be easy, as Wells Fargo has yet to shake free from the sales issues or more recent problems.Here are five key things to keep in mind before Mr. Sloan has his moment in the lights.Sharing the stageMr. Sloan is the only Wells Fargo banker slated to testify Tuesday, but he is scheduled to appear at the same time as another highly anticipated congressional hearing, that of former Equifax CEO Richard Smith in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.Wells Fargo's prepIn April, Wells Fargo named longtime executive David Moskowitz as its new head of government relations and public policy. The Washington-based executive hired a new law firm -- Sidley Austin LLP -- to advise the bank on the congressional hearing. Mr. Moskowitz and other Wells Fargo executives have met with congressional members and staff, but not Ms. Warren, according to people familiar with the matter. She is expected to press Mr. Sloan on positions she has already publicized, including her call to replace more directors on Wells Fargo's board due to the sales-practices scandal.Transparency mattersExecutives said they expect Mr. Sloan will be questioned more on accountability and is preparing to be as transparent as possible about what the bank has done in relation to its sales practices scandal and other consumer-lending problems. ""The day will be won or lost based on Tim's ability to articulate what we've done,"" one bank executive said.Rallying the troopsOne important constituency watching the hearing will be Wells Fargo's own employees. In late September, Mr. Sloan hosted an off-site for the bank's management committee, about top 100 executives, in Henderson, Nev. Mr. Sloan sought to get the top executives together in part to make sure they are aligned on overall strategy before the hearing, executives said.Follow the moneyBased on OpenSecrets.org, Wells Fargo spent just $1.7 million on lobbying in 2017 so far. That is low compared with the $4.71 million in 2016 and $6.39 million in 2015. The bank spokeswoman, Ms. Dunn, said the figure reflects two reported quarters for 2017 and it is difficult to estimate what the bank's year-end total will be."

Wells Fargo,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Wells Chief Defends Bank Amid Grilling," Oct 4, 2017",58.81,0,"Wells Fargo & Co. Chief Executive Timothy Sloan defended the bank's handling of its sales scandal and more recent consumer problems as the executive faced some tough questions and one call for his departure.Mr. Sloan ticked off a variety of changes Wells Fargo has made to its business over the past year, including those affecting management and customer practices, testifying in front of the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday.It wasn't enough to satisfy some of the bank's most vociferous critics. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), told Mr. Sloan he ""should be fired,"" calling him ""incompetent"" and ""complicit"" during the sales-practices scandal for not investigating the problems sooner.""Wells Fargo needs to start over; that won't happen until the bank rids itself of people like you,"" she said.Mr. Sloan apologized for the bank's conduct while defending his role as CEO, pointing to the changes that he has made leading the company over the past year. Though he is a 30-year veteran of the bank, he hasn't worked in the retail and consumer-lending units facing problems.In a later exchange between the senator and Mr. Sloan, the bank executive said he ""couldn't disagree more with almost everything Sen. Warren said,"" adding that she took statements out of context.Republican senators questioned Mr. Sloan seeking more details about the scope of the sales-practice problems, largely rehashing what happened.Wells Fargo is no stranger to congressional hearings, having two last year during its sales-practices scandal. But it was Mr. Sloan's first time in front of the committee, housed Tuesday in a packed room of about 75 people in the Dirksen Senate Office Building.Mr. Sloan replaced former chief John Stumpf after Mr. Stumpf abruptly retired about a year ago. During Tuesday's hearing, Mr. Sloan addressed questions on topics including forced arbitration, which deals with the legal forum that handles customer claims against the bank.The hearing largely focused on the bank's sales-practice problems, which led to the opening of potentially 3.5 million accounts for customers without their knowledge. Questions focused on how such a thing could happen and why executives didn't act sooner.Mr. Sloan also said during the hearing that the bank is reaching out to 108,000 customers for refunds over separate mortgage problems. Wells Fargo in recent months has disclosed problems with certain mortgage services as well as auto-insurance charges to customers resulting in refunds of around $80 million."
Wells Fargo,"Management: Boards Wake Up to Company Culture --- Whirlpool, Citigroup and CACI International boost oversight of their business environments"," Oct 4, 2017",59.73,0,"Corporate culture counts. But bad culture can damage a company's reputation, results and recruitment.That's why boards are starting to scrutinize the cultures of companies they serve. Directors at Whirlpool Corp., for example, make sure its workers feel comfortable divulging bad news by tracking internal surveys. Companies such as Citigroup Inc. and CACI International Inc. have formed board culture committees.Culture describes the way values and actions create a unique business environment. One recent study found that a positive corporate culture improves company profits.Yet ""few boards currently have an explicit focus or formalized approach to cultural oversight,"" said Helene Gayle, a director of Coca-Cola Co. and Colgate-Palmolive Co.A blue-ribbon panel co-led by Ms. Gayle wants boards to monitor corporate culture as vigilantly as they do risks. The 34-member commission, organized by the National Association of Corporate Directors, intends to release an extensive report on Wednesday that suggests how boards could bolster their oversight of company culture.The panel's 10 recommended steps include regular measurements of corporate culture, using a combination of factors such as chief executives' performance reviews and the scope of power held by risk-management officers. The panel also suggests crackdowns on incentive-pay plans that might weaken culture.""Oversight of corporate culture should be among the top governance imperatives for every board,"" the panel of independent directors, recruiters and consultants concluded. A strong culture offers ""a powerful source of competitive advantage,"" while companies with weak cultures see far higher levels of misconduct, the report said.Recent crises at Uber Technologies Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. were partly blamed on culture flaws.Uber is grappling with scandals, government probes and shareholder litigation. CEO Travis Kalanick quit under investor pressure in June. The ride-hailing company declined to comment on a shareholder suit filed in late September that called its corporate culture ""a toxic hotbed,"" threatening its business.Wells Fargo admitted culture problems following a sales-practices scandal that erupted a year ago. The bank said employees opened customer accounts using fictitious or unauthorized information to meet lofty sales goals. The revelation led then-CEO John Stumpf to retire abruptly."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Finance Watch," Oct 5, 2017",59.95,0,"Wells Fargo & Co. said it is refunding certain customers who may have wrongfully paid fees for mortgage lock extensions.The bank on Wednesday gave additional details on its plans after Chief Executive Timothy Sloan mentioned the refunds during a congressional hearing Tuesday.The San Francisco-based bank said it would reach out to all home-lending customers who paid fees for mortgage rate lock extensions from Sept. 16, 2013, through Feb. 28, 2017, about 110,000 customersWells Fargo said it expects the first refunds will go out by year-end.Customers in the time frame the bank examined paid a total of $98 million in fees, and the bank said it expects refunds to be lower than that total because ""a substantial number of those fees were appropriately charged.""Over the summer, the bank disclosed in a quarterly securities filing that it was reviewing policies and procedures around mortgage rate lock extension fees following media reports on the matter. It also disclosed that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was investigating the situation.Wells Fargo said in Wednesday's news release the decision to issue refunds followed an internal review that found its policy implemented in September 2013 wasn't consistent."
Wells Fargo,"Stocks Extend Record Run, Investors Wonder How It Ends"," Oct 6, 2017",59.95,1,"Stocks continue their steady march higher, notching milestones not seen in more than 20 years, yet many investors see few obstacles to the seemingly endless run.The S&P 500 closed at its sixth consecutive record Thursday, its longest streak of highs since 1997. A gauge of expected swings in the index fell to an all-time low. Investors don't see many worries ahead: The economy keeps growing at a slow but steady pace, corporate earnings remain healthy and investors are betting a tax overhaul will further boost profits.That isn't what many analysts and investors expected coming into this year, when they thought bond yields would rise as the economy heated up and stocks would stall as valuations remained stretched.Instead, bond yields are lower than where they ended last year -- the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note stood at 2.352% Thursday, down from 2.446% at the end of 2016 -- and inflation remains stubbornly short of the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Stocks have kept climbing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite also closed at fresh highs Thursday.""It's kind of like the 1996 moment where Alan Greenspan himself called stocks irrationally exuberant"" and the rally continued for three more years, said Jason Pride, director of investment strategy at Glenmede, with some $37 billion in assets under management. Stocks are expensive now, but they ""are not at extremes,"" he said.The S&P 500's current record streak is the longest since the eight highs ending June 17, 1997, during the dot-com boom.The markets have been so calm that some analysts and investors have expressed concerns that money managers are growing complacent. The CBOE Volatility Index, known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" fell 4.6% Thursday to 9.19, surpassing its record closing low of 9.31 set in December 1993.Stock-market gains have been broad, spanning regions and sectors. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average closed at its highest level since August 2015 on Thursday. The Stoxx Europe 600 rose for nine straight trading days through Tuesday, its longest winning streak in more than two years.Several U.S. companies have posted outsize gains this year. In the Dow industrials, Boeing Co. has risen 66%, while Caterpillar Inc. and Visa Inc. each have added 36%. Stock advances have also been widespread, with all 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 in positive territory for the month so far.October brings back painful memories of the financial crisis and the crash of 1987 for many investors and analysts. And the long economic expansion and eight-year bull market have some saying this rally can't go on forever.There are signs of skepticism, with some investors pulling money out of U.S. stocks even as they hit records.Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds tracking U.S. equities posted outflows in the second quarter, according to fund tracker EPFR Global, their first quarterly outflows since the third quarter of 2016. Stock-trading volumes on major U.S. exchanges have hovered below average levels for the year in recent weeks -- reflecting investors' lack of conviction in the rally, some analysts say."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: New Rule Reduces Broker Poaching," Oct 12, 2017",60.02,1,"A new retirement-savings rule is helping to curtail an expensive practice that Wall Street executives have long bemoaned: paying big bonuses to lure brokers from rival firms.The fall in recruitment costs, driven in part by the introduction of the fiduciary rule, is expected to help boost earnings among brokerages when they report quarterly results this month.Brokerages have long engaged in ""prisoner exchanges"" -- poaching each others' employees in their rivalry for talent and assets. They offer signing bonuses worth hundreds of thousands of dollars or more, representing significant chunks of brokers' compensation packages.Such bonuses usually come through promissory notes, or loans that are forgivable after about seven years. These are structured to help retain brokers in a business where clients tend to follow them as they move. A broker who leaves before the term of the contract must repay the remainder. If, for example, a broker who received a $1 million seven-year recruitment loan and left after just two years would have to pay back about $714,000 before interest.But the loans are a heavy burden for brokerages, representing billions of dollars on firms' balance sheets.The fiduciary rule, which went into partial effect in June, requires stewards of retirement accounts to act in clients' best interest rather than sometimes selling products that are simply more lucrative to the brokers themselves. One part of it, requiring ""reasonable compensation,"" is helping to speed up a decline in broker poaching because the big bonuses may run afoul of the rule.The financial industry fought the regulation, saying it limits access to investment advice and choice. But it has also provided them with a boon. It has boosted firms' revenue as firms shift clients into accounts that charge fees, often more lucrative than commissions that can violate the regulation. And a reduction in hefty expenses tied to recruitment signing bonuses stands to benefit earnings.After taking office this year, the Trump administration delayed full implementation of the fiduciary rule as it evaluates whether to preserve it.But Devin Ryan, a financial-industry analyst at JMP Securities, said the change will have an enduring impact on the industry no matter the outcome. ""The rule has driven a rationalization in the recruiting landscape"" that will potentially save brokerages money, he said.In the most recent quarter, Morgan Stanley and UBS Group AG reported double-digit percent declines in the amount of recruitment loans to their financial advisers from a year earlier -- 13% to $4.24 billion and 15% to $2.75 billion, respectively."
Wells Fargo,Goldman To Lend To House Flippers," Oct 13, 2017",59.55,1,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s push to lend more has taken it to some strange places for a storied, elite Wall Street firm. The latest: house flipping.Goldman is acquiring Genesis Capital LLC, a closely held Los Angeles firm that backs investors seeking to buy, spruce up and quickly sell homes. Genesis, founded in 2007, has been growing rapidly as the housing market continues to recover. It lent $1 billion last year, up from $50 million in 2013.Goldman's interest in a small house-flipping financier reflects both the buoyancy of the residential real-estate market and the Wall Street firm's hunger for new profit engines as its core trading business remains stuck in a postcrisis slump.Last year, Goldman launched Marcus, an online personal-lending platform that offers a lower-cost alternative for borrowers deep in credit-card debt. A new partnership with Fidelity Investments will offer Goldman loans to millions of individual brokerage accounts.House flipping, once a symbol of the real-estate market's excess, has become hot again. Borrowers took out $40 billion of these loans in 2016, the most since 2006, when flippers rushed to capitalize on rising home prices, and in some cases fueled the mania.Genesis's loans average about $1 million, carry rates of as much as 12% and run for about a year. Since 2014, they have been funded by Oaktree Capital Management LP, an alternative-asset giant.Genesis will swap Oaktree's backing for deeper pockets at Goldman, which in recent years bought a deposit base from GE Capital. Terms of Goldman's deal with Genesis weren't disclosed.Goldman has been pushing lending as its traditional engines of trading and banking either sputter or mature. It has chosen its spots carefully, avoiding credit cards and other businesses that would put it in direct competition with large rivals and instead focusing on niche products where there is room to grow.Buying Genesis inches Goldman closer to residential mortgages -- an area executives have eyed warily, mindful of the public-relations and regulatory drubbing the firm took during the financial crisis for its subprime-trading activities.Home-flipping finance, while a niche of the giant residential-mortgage market, is again a big business, after falling sharply following the crisis. About 35% of house-flippers today use borrowed money, a nine-year high, according to Attom Data Solutions, which tracks home sales.Alex Sifakis has taken out more than 100 loans from Genesis to renovate and sell homes in and around Jacksonville, Fla. Mr. Sifakis, 34 years old, got into the business in 2006 after attending a real-estate seminar on how to flip homes. He is now president of JWB Real Estate Capital, which has about 55 employees.When Mr. Sifakis started borrowing from Genesis three years ago, ""there were not that many lenders out there,"" he said. Now, rising home prices and falling inventories have attracted new lenders offering lower rates, as well as increased competition from new borrowers.""A lot more new home flippers are coming out of the woodwork,"" he said. They ""have seen the [TV] shows."" (HGTV has become one of the fastest-growing cable-TV channels by airing shows such as ""Flip or Flop."")Banks and other large financial firms are increasingly dabbling in the business, though few as directly as Goldman will now do. Wells Fargo & Co. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. have extended credit lines to fix-and-flip lenders. Last year, Japanese investment bank Nomura Holdings Inc. securitized $126 million in loans from online real-estate lender LendingHome Corp.In recent months, buyers backed by Blackstone Group LP and Fortress Investment Group LLC have bought companies that specialize in these loans.Genesis's loans will be booked through Goldman's regulated banking entity, which is looking for places to deploy its growing stash of deposits. But because Genesis's borrowers don't intend to live in the properties they buy, their loans are generally classified as commercial credits."

Wells Fargo,Wells Fargo Falls Further Behind Rivals," Oct 14, 2017",56.5,0,"As other large banks were all reporting solid quarterly earnings this week, Wells Fargo disappointed. Third-quarter net income fell 19% from a year earlier, hit by a $1 billion charge for a coming mortgage-related regulatory settlement.Regulatory fines are far from the only issue dogging the bank, as revenue fell 2%. Banks are all contending with slower loan growth, but at Wells Fargo total loans actually declined 1% from a year earlier in the third quarter. That compares with total loan growth of 2% to 3% for rivals J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America.The bank blamed a host of factors for the drop, including an earlier pullback in auto lending, pay downs by corporate borrowers and ""continued underwriting discipline."" Yet an unstated factor -- the company's tarnished brand from repeated scandals -- probably is playing a role, too. Total consumer loans fell 3% from a year earlier.Incredibly, Wells Fargo even is failing to take advantage of higher interest rates, the one positive factor boosting the entire industry. This is the result of an earlier strategic decision to position itself for lower rates by holding more long-dated assets. That is coming back to bite the bank as short-term rates are rising faster than long-term rates.Following a June rate increase by the Federal Reserve, the bank's third-quarter net interest margin nonetheless declined 0.03 percentage point from the prior quarter to 2.87%. Net interest margins were up at J.P. Morgan and Bank of America and flat at Citigroup.Despite all this, Wells Fargo still trades at a lofty 1.53 times book value, compared with an average of 1.1 times book for its three large peers. Its shares have lagged behind rivals this year and performance doesn't seem poised to improve. For investors, as well as many consumers, Wells Fargo remains a name to avoid."
Wells Fargo,Equifax's Credibility Rating Falls Below 200," Oct 14, 2017",56.13,0,"Regarding your editorial ""Hypocrisy and Hacking"" (Oct. 7): The business model of credit bureaus ought to be investigated and reviewed. Companies are collecting my personal information without my consent, getting some amount of it incorrect or out of date which influences my ability to borrow. Then if I discover errors, it's my responsibility to prove to them that I'm right. To add insult to injury, they're monetizing that information by selling it to businesses without my consent, and now even charging me to have access to it while allowing my information (I'm one of the 143 million victims) to be hacked. Does anyone else see the lunacy of this?Instead of arguing over executive compensation clawbacks and firing IT people, neither of which directly help or benefit me, I suggest that Equifax be held responsible for the financial burden now imposed on those of us affected. For starters, I just signed up for LifeLock at the suggestion of one of the financial institutions where my identity was used to set up a checking and brokerage account. The premium package is $29.99 a month. Equifax should be responsible for paying for the burden laid on consumers for the rest of our lives That's roughly $54 million annually, and it would benefit those of us impacted more than all the things being bantered about by Congress.If one wanted to be even more equitable, the government could saddle Equifax with the filing for credit freezes and applying for the LifeLock accounts. But beginning with footing the immediate make-good responsibility and making it stick for the life of those of us impacted would be a fair start."
Wells Fargo,Wells Fargo Trips as BofA Cruises --- Lender's profit sinks 19% amid legal issues; Bank of America's net is biggest in six years," Oct 14, 2017",55.4,0,"But their performance diverged from there, marking the strongest evidence yet that the two big consumer lenders have changed places, with Bank of America emerging as a budding investor darling and Wells Fargo taking the role of problem child following a series of missteps.Wells Fargo said Friday that third-quarter profit tumbled 19% from a year ago, due to continued fallout from its sales-practice scandal and fresh legal issues. The San Francisco-based bank said revenue also fell from a year earlier, while its loan portfolio shrank for a third consecutive quarter. Wells Fargo continued to struggle with higher expenses in the wake of the scandal and a newly disclosed $1 billion litigation charge tied to investigations into crisis-era mortgage-market practices.Wells Fargo's shares fell 2.8% to $53.69 on Friday.Bank of America, on the other hand, is putting once-intractable problems behind it. The lender reported its highest quarterly profit in six years. The bank's revenue rose, as it did at peers J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. earlier in the week. Even a decline in Bank of America's trading revenue didn't dent overall results much, as gains in interest income and continued cost-cutting helped offset the weakness. Its shares gained 1.5% to $25.83.Wells Fargo, a former investor favorite that once surpassed J.P. Morgan as the most valuable U.S. bank by market capitalization, has slipped behind Bank of America to the No. 3 ranking on this basis.While Wells Fargo by some measures remains the more profitable bank, the two lenders' revenues are now about equal, with Wells Fargo's roughly $87 million advantage down from nearly $900 million in the second quarter of 2016 before the sales problems emerged.Led by Chief Executive Timothy Sloan, Wells Fargo reported that net income during the quarter slipped below $5 billion for the first timein five years, due in large part to the $1 billion it accrued for a previously disclosed mortgage probeover residential mortgage-backed securities. The bank is likely to settle with the Justice Department in coming months, finance chief John Shrewsberry said in an interview.While Wells Fargo suffered a rough quarter, shareholder Hank Smith said he is optimistic about the banking sector overall. That, he said, is because of economic growth, slowly rising interest rates and the expectation of less onerous regulations under the Trump administration.""While the quarter was disappointing, it wasn't a dramatic disappointment,"" said Mr. Smith, co-chief investment officer of Haverford Trust Co., which owns 2.7 million Wells Fargo shares.The biggest reason for the shifting fortunes of the two banks is the declining number of regulatory issues at Bank of America and the increasing tally at Wells Fargo.As recently as 2014, Bank of America's results were dogged by tens of billions of dollars in penalties over financial-crisis-era issues. Since then, the company's legal problems have eased and it has made a concerted effort to cut costs and focus on safer businesses such as lending to consumers with good credit.Wells Fargo didn't face as many regulatory fines until cross-selling abuses by branch stafferuptedin September 2016,with employees creating potentially3.5 million fake accounts.The bank fired 5,300 employees over five years related to the sales problems.Two months after the bank settled that case, Donald Trump's election as president raised the prospect of faster economic growth and higher interest rates, a combination that brightened the prospects for many banks, but especially Bank of America given its large mortgage-securities portfolio.The result is that Bank of America shares have soaredmore than 63% over the past year. That move is the biggest gain among the six big U.S. banks, four of which reported earnings this past week.The last two, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., are slated to report resultsTuesday.Wells Fargo posted the worst performance over the period, with a 20% gain.Bank of America received an additional boost whenWarren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the largest shareholder at both lenders, discussed the banks in a late-August television interview.He said both were ""terrific"" but that Wells Fargo likely had more troubles ahead. ""What you find is there's never just one cockroach in the kitchen,"" he said.He has praised CEO Brian Moynihan's leadership and said he plans to be a Bank of America shareholder for a long time.Bank of America's third-quarter profit rose because the bank continued to cut costs and got a lift in lending profits from higher interest rates. The results put the bank close to its long-held profitability goals.Meanwhile, costs at Wells Fargo jumped 8%, to $14.35 billion, and Mr. Sloan said they are likely to remain heightened through year-end 2018. The bank also raised the target for its efficiency ratio because of lower-than-expected asset growth and higher-than-expected expenses.The $1 billion litigation charge at Wells Fargo also cut into its community-banking unit results."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Wells Fargo to Pay $3.4 Million Over Advisers' Flub," Oct 17, 2017",57.54,0,"A federal investigation into sales practices at Wells Fargo & Co. now includes the bank's wealth-management business, extending the probe beyond the firm's retail-banking unit where the problems originated, people familiar with the matter said.The Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are conducting the investigation into the wealth-management business, these people said. Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation have been interviewing some wealth-management employees in the Phoenix area as recently as this week, some of these people said.Wells Fargo declined to comment. Officials at the Justice Department and SEC also declined to comment.Several U.S. attorney's offices, as well as a bevy of federal and state regulators, have been investigating Wells Fargo since the fall of 2016 when the bank disclosed widespread sales-practices problems. Those included bank employees opening as many as 3.5 million accounts without customers' knowledge or authorization. Wells Fargo has said it is cooperating with the investigations.Arizona was one epicenter of Wells Fargo's retail-banking problems. Some employees in that region created fake email addresses using customers' phone numbers to open banking accounts or opened two accounts for each customer, a practice known as a ""double pack."" Some top executives from that region have since been fired by the bank.Prosecutors' and regulators' inquiries have largely centered on Wells Fargo's retail-banking business, one of the largest in the U.S. by deposits. Late last year, though, the Justice Department told the bank to conduct an independent investigation into its wealth-management business after it received reports of problems there from whistleblowers, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.The investigation by the Justice Department and SEC is separate from the bank's own inquiry, one of the people familiar with the matter said. The bank now faces state and federal investigations into its practices in auto-lending, mortgages, wealth and investment management and foreign exchangeThe widening of the sales-practices investigation has occurred despite Wells Fargo's attempts to put the problems behind it by restructuring different businesses, firing executives and refunding customers. Wells Fargo also has faced regulatory censure for failing to address risk-management issues that led to improper customer charges in its auto-lending and mortgage businesses.In early February, the Federal Reserve sanctioned Wells Fargo for failing to put proper risk controls in place, barring the bank from growing past the $1.95 trillion in assets it had at the end of 2017. The Fed cited ""widespread consumer abuses"" in its unprecedented rebuke.Earlier this month, Wells Fargo disclosed in a securities filing its independent review into the wealth-management business. At the time, the bank said it is assessing ""whether there have been inappropriate referrals or recommendations, including with respect to rollovers for 401(k) plan participants, certain alternative investments, or referrals of brokerage customers to the company's investment and fiduciary services business.""The bank's filing also disclosed that it is reviewing fee calculations within certain fiduciary and custody accounts. The bank has found instances of incorrect fees applied to certain assets and accounts that resulted in overcharging customers, according to the filing."
Wells Fargo,Global Investors Bullish on New York," Oct 18, 2017",57.28,1,"A major commodities index posted its 10th straight session of gains on Monday, another sign that investors have shrugged off recent market volatility and are diving back into risky assets.The S&P GSCI Index, which tracks the prices of 24 commodities, has been moving in tandem with global stock markets since last summer as money managers look to capitalize on accelerating global economic growth. The index has risen 5.9% from its Feb. 9 low, with some of the most actively traded raw materials such as oil and copper rebounding following drops alongside stocks earlier this month.Those and other commodities benefit from stronger economic growth because they serve as building blocks for everything from houses and office buildings to automobiles and smartphones. Higher levels of industrial activity, low unemployment and bustling shipping routes tend to buoy demand for petroleum and other raw materials, further supporting commodities prices.With the global economy projected by the International Monetary Fund to grow at its fastest pace since 2011 this year and next year, some investors think a commodities rally that began last summer will continue. As is the case with stocks, some analysts think the fundamentals for investing in raw materials outweigh possible concerns about higher interest rates.""This is one of the strongest macro backdrops I've seen for investing,"" said Mike Mullaney, director of global market research for fund manager Boston Partners, whose firm has increased positions in energy and materials stocks. ""That lends itself to overweighting some of these commodity-based sectors.""Unlike stocks, commodities are still relatively cheap. Oil is still off 56% from its 2008 highs, while gold and copper are off 30% and 31%, respectively, from their records set in 2011.In recent months, stocks around the world and raw materials have traded together, and the recent bounce back for commodities has come as the S&P 500 has recovered 68% of the losses that sent it into correction territory on Feb. 8.That makes the rally look vulnerable to investors' appetite for risk and the direction of the stock market, some analysts say.Some analysts think that riskier investments are likely to weaken as central banks around the world unwind years of accommodative monetary policy. Higher interest rates can make commodities less attractive compared with yield-bearing assets such as Treasurys because raw materials pay their holders nothing. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note has risen to four-year highs and is approaching 3%. It closed at 2.862% MondayOthers think an economic slowdown in China, the world's largest materials consumer, and supply factors continue to loom over the market.John LaForge, head of real asset strategy for the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he thinks commodities have been too dependent on temporary factors -- such as protests in Iran and labor strikes at mines in Chile and Peru -- that have pinched output. Commodities prices are still way off their peaks, and even with recently rising prices, he doesn't expect that trend to reverse.""There's still just too much supply,"" Mr. LaForge said.Other analysts said signs that inflation is picking up should favor commodities. Many investors use raw materials to protect against a surge in consumer prices because they think commodities can hold their value better than other assets. Price increases in commodities also typically contribute to higher inflation as it becomes more expensive for companies to produce goods.Several large companies, including Ford Motor Co. and Procter & Gamble Co., have already blamed weaker profits or darker outlooks on higher commodities prices. Although persistently low inflation has puzzled economists for years, recent U.S. employment data showed wages notching their biggest increase since 2009.Doug Cohen, managing partner of portfolio management at Athena Capital Advisors, said the firm has increased its clients' positions in gold and Treasury-inflation protected securities.""I actually do think this time it's real,"" he said of inflation rising.Fresh money has been pouring back into commodities funds world-wide: Assets under management reached roughly $530 billion in January, up 13% from the previous month and their highest level in four years, Citigroup estimates show. A JPMorgan Chase analysis showed the largest January inflow of open interest into commodities over the past decade.""The environment for investing in commodities is the best since 2004-2008,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note to clients earlier this month."
Wells Fargo,Business &amp;amp; Finance," Oct 21, 2017",58.16,0,"Wells Fargo & Co. is having trouble doing right by the customers it has wronged.The big bank acknowledged that it recently sent out 38,000 erroneous communications to customers that it forced to buy unneeded auto insurance.In some cases, according to two people briefed on the matter, Wells Fargo has also sent refunds to people who weren't the bank's customers; notified those who were harmed of incorrect amounts to be paid; and told people of coming refunds though they had never gotten the insurance.In another matter, Wells Fargo has yet to begin a broad-based reach-out related to refunds for as many as 110,000 customers who were charged improper fees to extend interest-rate commitments they received from Wells Fargo on their mortgages, people familiar with the matter said.Wells Fargo will soon require mortgage customers to agree to a refund through the mail before sending them money and estimates half or fewer will do so, the people said.Catherine Pulley, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said in a statement: ""We are focused on making things right for our customers and ensuring this large-scale remediation happens correctly and as quickly as possible.""She said a Wells Fargo vendor working on the auto-insurance matter caught a coding mistake that resulted in 38,000 customers receiving a letter they didn't need with no checks included. Wells Fargo is working with the vendor ""to ensure these customers receive the appropriate communication -- including any refunds they're eligible for,"" she said. Ms. Pulley added that the bank is currently aware of one noncustomer having received a check.The problem mailings and refund delays are happening as the bank continues to grapple with regulatory scrutiny following its sales-practices misconduct.For those actions and others, the Fed earlier this month took the unprecedented action of restricting the bank's growth until ""it sufficiently improves its governance and controls.""That punishment followed a rebuke issued to Wells Fargo last fall by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Citing repeated deficiencies, the regulator warned the bank that it would likely face enforcement proceedings because of them.The OCC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, another regulator, are aware of the refund delays with mortgage customers and have been pressing the bank about them, a person familiar with the matter said. The regulators have also been involved with auto-lending refunds, approving different phases of the mailings.A spokesman for the OCC declined to comment. The CFPB declined to comment.Last summer, the bank said it had forced nearly 600,000 customers who financed their car purchases with Wells Fargo to pay for collision coverage they didn't need. The practices pushed 274,000 customers, among them active military service members, into delinquency on their auto loans, according to an internal report commissioned by the bank, and resulted in 20,000 wrongful car repossessions."
Wells Fargo,Wells Fargo Fires Four Amid Probe Of Currency Business," Oct 21, 2017",64.07,1,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average swung in a range of more than 500 points before closing slightly lower, extending a string of volatility as investors assess how the potential for higher interest rates would affect the nearly nine-year bull market.The blue-chip index has moved wildly this week, trading in its two biggest intraday ranges in history on Monday and Tuesday when the index swung 1,596.65 and 1,167.49 points, respectively.A recent rise in bond yields has stoked fears that a pickup in inflation could lead central banks to tighten monetary policy more quickly than expected, making stocks less attractive as interest rates rise. Those concerns helped push stocks sharply lower Friday and Monday when the Dow suffered its biggest one-session point decline on record. Tuesday's uneven session -- with 29 changes of direction for the Dow -- ended with sizable gains.Some investors said the declines were overdue and created a buying opportunity given favorable earnings growth that they think should help stocks continue marching higher. Still, others warn that technical selling drove the recent pullback rather than investors panicking, which might suggest more dips lie ahead.""We're just now digesting what's been a pretty violent reaction,"" said Jamie Robertson, senior portfolio manager of global asset allocation at Manulife Asset Management, which reduced stock positions recently but is now discussing increasing them. ""This is the type of market action you get once you've had a bit of a dust storm.""After spending most of Wednesday's session in positive territory and rising as much as 381 points, the Dow industrials turned lower toward the end of the day and closed down 19.42 points, or 0.1%, at 24893.35.

The S&P 500 energy sector fell 1.7%, bringing its losses in the past week to 8.2%. It has been the broader index's worst performer during that span.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.843% from 2.766% Tuesday.

Wells Fargo,"AmEx Mission: Regain Brand's Cachet --- New CEO will have to deal with increasing competition from banks, fintech firms"," Oct 21, 2017",65.51,1,"The downgrade of the assessment, known as a CAMELS score, occurred over the summer of 2017, as Wells Fargo continued to grapple with issues related to how it treats customers. In September 2016, the bank settled allegations that it had years of improper sales practices that resulted in potentially 3.5 million accounts being opened without customers' knowledge.Elsewhere in the bank, more than 550,000 auto-loan and mortgage customers were potentially overcharged for products for years as well. Regulators' most recent concerns focus on the bank's overall approach to catching and preventing problems that can harm customers, a major part of risk management.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has been weighing a new enforcement action against the bank related to such risk controls, the Journal reported earlier this month.A Wells Fargo spokeswoman at the time declined to comment on the bank's CAMELS rating or any potential OCC actions. The spokeswoman then said the bank is ""very focused on prudent and effective risk management"" and continues to enhance those matters.Mr. Loughlin, 62 years old, has been with the bank or its predecessors for 36 years and has been chief risk officer since 2008. He reports directly to Wells Fargo Chief Executive Timothy Sloan and has served on the bank's operating committee of its top executives.Mr. Sloan said in a statement that Mr. Loughlin has served during ""some of the most critical times in our company's history,"" including the financial crisis and the bank's acquisition of Wachovia Corp.Since then, Mr. Loughlin has overseen risk matters related to credit, markets, operations, compliance and cybersecurity, according to the bank.Over the past two years, Mr. Loughlin also led a plan to centralize many of the company's risk functions. But Wells Fargo didn't always specify employees' new roles and responsibilities, current and former executives said. Regulators noticed the problems, and Mr. Loughlin had to submit a new risk framework to them in the first half of 2017, these executives said."
Wells Fargo,Senate Strikes Obama Regulation," Oct 25, 2017",,1,"WASHINGTON -- Congress overturned a rule by an Obama-appointed financial regulator that would have made it easier for consumers to sue banks in groups, with Vice President Mike Pence casting a tiebreaking vote in the Senate.The 51-50 vote handed the financial industry its most significant legislative victory since President Donald Trump took office and was a rebuke of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray, who pressed ahead with his agenda in defiance of Republicans.The move is one of the final steps in killing a CFPB rule barring fine-print requirements for arbitration in contracts between consumers and banks. The House voted 231-190 in July to overturn the rule. The resolution now goes to Mr. Trump, who is expected to sign it into law.The vice president has broken Senate ties five times so far in the Trump administration.Republican senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John Kennedy of Louisiana sided with Democrats in opposition to the measure.The CFPB's rule prevents companies from including in consumer contracts arbitration clauses that block class-action lawsuits, though it doesn't ban arbitration entirely. Such clauses are commonly used for a range of financial products, including credit cards, certain auto loans, payday loans and private student loans. It was set to go into effect next year.Critics in the financial industry and Congress say arbitration provides a faster and more cost-effective way to resolve disputes with consumers than the courts. They say the CFPB's rule would have forced the resolution of disagreements into class-action litigation.""This is a rule to benefit the plaintiffs bar,"" Sen. Mike Crapo (R., Idaho), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said on the floor before the vote.The CFPB said group lawsuits get more money back to consumers, while deterring harmful practices by financial companies. Supporters of the CFPB rule have pointed to the use of arbitration clauses by Wells Fargo & Co. and Equifax Inc., two scandal-ridden companies, as examples of how such clauses could prevent consumers from holding companies accountable.""Tonight's vote is a giant setback for every consumer in this country. Wall Street won and ordinary people lost,"" Mr. Cordray said in a statement.Congress's overturning of the arbitration rule foreshadows significant changes that the CFPB is expected to face over the coming months as the Trump administration appoints a new leader to the bureau. Mr. Cordray's term runs through next July, but many think he might step down sooner to run for governor in Ohio.Republican lawmakers targeted the arbitration rule with a legislative tool known as the Congressional Review Act. It allows lawmakers to overturn a new regulation on an expedited schedule with a simple majority vote in Congress.Tuesday's vote marked the 14th time this year Congress has successfully turned to that act to overturn Obama-initiated regulations."

Wells Fargo,Wells Fargo Trading Under Scrutiny," Oct 28, 2017",,0,"Federal prosecutorsare investigating foreign-exchange trading at Wells Fargo & Co. and have subpoenaed information from the firm, which recently fired bankers in that business, according to people familiar with the matter.The investigation, which is in the early stages, is being conducted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, some of the people said. The office subpoenaed information in recent days, according to some of the people. A week ago, The Wall Street Journal reported that Wells Fargo had fired four foreign-exchange bankers amid an internal investigation.Issues within the bank's foreign-exchange operation revolve around a single trade and ensuing dispute with one client, Restaurant Brands International Inc., the people said. This company is the owner of Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, and -- like Wells Fargo -- counts Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. as a major shareholder.In a statement, Wells Fargo said it ""learned of an issue associated with a foreign-exchange transaction for a single client. The matter was reviewed, the client was promptly notified regarding the issue, and Wells Fargo leadership took steps to hold accountable the individuals who were involved. Wells Fargo remains committed to our foreign-exchange business, meeting our clients' financial needs in an ethical way, and ensuring ongoing review of this and all business operations.""A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District didn't respond to requests for comment.Investigations into Wells Fargo's foreign-exchange business, which is housed within its investment bank, are separate from sales-practices issues that rocked the bank more than a year ago. But they come at a sensitive time for the bank: Wells Fargo remains under political and regulatory pressure because of the sales scandal, which remains under separate investigation by the Justice Department and other agencies. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District also is involved in one of those investigations.The foreign-exchange issue revolves around a trade made within the past three years that included positions running into the billions of dollars for Restaurant Brands, the people said. The trade resulted in a loss to Restaurant Brands, the people added, which led to a dispute between it and the bank.Wells Fargo is planning to refund Restaurant Brands hundreds of thousands of dollars because of the loss, one of the people familiar with the matter said.In addition to the Justice Department, potential issues around the Wells Fargo trade also are being examined by the Federal Reserve, some of the people said.The bank recently fired the four foreign-exchange bankers for cause and launched an internal investigation, according to people familiar with the matter. Those fired were Simon Fowles, recently head of foreign-exchange trading; Bob Gotelli, recently head of foreign-exchange sales; Jed Guenther, recently a regional head of foreign exchange, and Michael Schaufler, chief spot dealer, The Wall Street Journal has previously reported.A spokeswoman for the bank has confirmed that these individuals no longer work for Wells Fargo.The bankers didn't respond to requests for comment.Federal prosecutors are looking into the sequencing of the trade in question and whether it could have involved so-called front-running, some of the people familiar with the matter said. Front-running typically involves a trader jumping ahead of a client's order, buying or selling for their own account to profit when the larger transaction moves a price."
Wells Fargo,The House GOP Tax Bill: Banks Sidestep Tax-Plan Pitfall," Nov 3, 2017",,0,"The U.S. b Banks do pretty well under the tax bill unveiled Thursday: It puts them on track for big tax cuts yet lets the firms avoid some of the biggest potential downsides of the overhaul.At a 20% corporate tax rate, banks stand to be among the biggest winners from tax reform, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The five biggest diversified U.S. banks alone might have had tax savings of $11.5 billion in 2016 at that rate, the biggest sum for any sub-industry group tracked by S&P.That is because those big banks, such as Wells Fargo & Co., typically pay higher effective tax rates than companies that are much more profitable, such as Apple Inc. Banks in the S&P 500 pay an effective 25% rate, versus an 18% rate for information technology firms, the data provider said.Aside from the overall corporate tax rate, bank investors were also concerned with how legislators would limit the deductibility of interest costs. On the face of it, that could upend the banking model since financial firms are highly leveraged, deploying huge amounts of debt themselves to make loans or buy instruments like bonds. Given that, interest expense for banks is akin to nonfinancial companies' cost of goods sold.The legislation proposed by the House Ways and Means Committee appears to let banks sidestep that issue, though. It does so by limiting the deductibility for companies that spend more money on interest than they take in, said Mark Roe, a professor at Harvard Law School. Banks by and large bring in far more in interest than they pay out.The upshot is that the change shouldn't affect banks or result in them paying more for debt that ranges from deposits to long-term bonds.The bill's clampdown on interest expense deductibility also spares some of banks' important borrowers -- commercial real-estate firms. They were excluded from the provision, a relief for banks and the companies themselves since they are already under pressure as their retail tenants get squeezed by online competitors."
Wells Fargo,Bank Investors Made a Mint on Crisis," Nov 7, 2017",,1,"Banking industry is booming -- a development that is bringing windfall gains to a small group of investors who had the gumption to buy esoteric bank securities when the outlook for financial firms and the economy was far less clear cut.After years of banks grappling with the fallout of the crisis and low interest rates, the bets on what are known as TARP warrants are finally paying off. The investors, who include fund managers John Paulson and Bill Miller, bought these warrants for bank stocks secondhand, after they were initially issued to the government during the 2008 bank bailout.The investors' unpopular view at the time was that banks and their stock prices would recover to precrisis levels. By betting on warrants, a high-octane security similar to an option, the fund managers basically doubled down on that opinion, risking their entire investment if it didn't happen by 2018 or 2019.""If the subprime credit-default swaps were this asymmetric, beautiful investment to express what was wrong with American capitalism . . . , these securities are the opposite,"" said Django Davidson, a founding partner at London-based Hosking Partners LLP, which bought about $200 million of the warrants for banks including Bank of America Corp.The warrants date to the financial crisis, when the government invested about $250 billion in about 700 banks as a part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. As part of TARP, which aimed to shore up bank capital and restart lending, the government got warrants to buy shares in the banks. The Treasury Department started getting rid of the warrants in 2009, a process that included selling some off to investors.For years after the crisis, many investors hated bank stocks, comparing them to heavily regulated utilities no longer able to take risks and grow. The warrants also slumped; some of Citigroup Inc.'s fell so much they were delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2016.But since the November 2016 presidential election, bank stocks have helped lead a broad stock-market rally tied to renewed confidence and hopes of tax and regulatory overhaul. Meanwhile, banks' crisis-era legal problems have subsided and interest rates have started to rise, making lending more profitable.The change in sentiment has made the warrants a turnaround story. Some from big banks have surged 65% to 1,440% since the election, easily outpacing the 36% rally in the KBW Nasdaq Bank stock index. One group of Bank of America's warrants, once left for dead, are up the most in the group. With the recent jump, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. warrants are up 426% since they started trading in late 2009, compared with a 146% increase for the bank's stock.The warrants give investors the right to buy a stock at a predetermined price. If the stock rises far above that ""strike price,"" the warrant is like a winning lottery ticket. If it stays below that price, the warrant ends up worthless.While exchange-traded stock options usually go out only a couple of years, warrants often last longer. ""We were lucky it was a 10-year warrant,"" said Philippe Jabre, a Geneva-based fund manager who bought warrants in SunTrust Banks Inc., among others. He said the recovery took longer than he had expected.""There were good days and other days when I felt like crying,"" said John Hadwen, a portfolio manager at CI Investments' Signature Global Asset Management, which has held TARP warrants since 2010. When his J.P. Morgan warrants fell in value after the bank's 2012 London whale trading loss, Mr. Hadwen pushed to buy the rest available, but the Canadian asset manager's chief investment officer said no.Mr. Davidson said he learned about the warrants a few years ago at an Omaha, Neb., bar where he was mingling with attendees at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting. Warren Buffett, the conglomerate's chairman, got warrants unrelated to TARP as a part of Berkshire's crisis-era investments in Goldman Sachs Group and Bank of America.The Miller Opportunity Trust mutual fund said it has notched gains of about $77 million on a $24 million investment in J.P. Morgan warrants.When the fund bought the warrants, ""the market hated financials and was pricing in pretty dire scenarios,"" said Samantha McLemore, co-manager on the portfolio with Mr. Miller.Mr. Paulson, who made billions of dollars betting against subprime mortgages a decade ago, turned a roughly $100 million profit on about $600 million in bank warrant investments, according to a person familiar with the matter. But he could have earned more if his funds hadn't sold their J.P. Morgan warrants in 2012. Mr. Miller's fund similarly lost out by selling Bank of America warrants around that time, though Ms. McLemore said the fund has done well by hanging on to the bank's common stock.Investors got the warrants only because the U.S. government didn't want to hold on to them. By late 2009, the biggest banks had paid TARP money back and the Treasury started auctioning the warrants. By the end of 2012, it had made about $5 billion auctioning them off to investors. In other cases, Treasury sold the warrants back to the banks.That has transferred the rest of the gains to private hands. The TARP warrants still trading in Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo & Co. and PNC Financial Services Group Inc., for example, are worth more than $2 billion more on paper than when the government sold. At banks such as J.P. Morgan that hit their strike price a while ago, investors have likely netted additional profits by exercising the warrants.New York-based Maltese Capital Management bought 2.2 million TARP warrants in Salt Lake City-based Zions Bancorp. from the government for about $1.35 apiece and held on to most of them. Today, they are worth about $11.15 a share, a return of around 726%. ""We'd like a few more of those,"" said Terry Maltese, the firm's founder."

Wells Fargo,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Some Munis' Tax-Free Status at Risk," Nov 9, 2017",,0,"A team of private and public officials prepared a routine offer for investors last week: Buy tax-exempt bonds to pay for the widening of an interstate outside Washington.But demand for the debt swelled after Republicans unveiled a proposal to end the tax-free benefits of these so-called private-activity bonds, says an investor who participated in the offering. Prices on the Interstate 66 bonds have jumped 3% since the $353 million offering closed last Friday morning, according to Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board data.It didn't take long for the House Republican tax plan to roil a roughly $750 billion corner of the muni-debt market.""Over the last three trading days, the types of bonds that are scheduled for potential elimination are being gobbled up,"" said John Miller, co-head of Global Fixed Income at Nuveen Asset Management. ""People are paying higher prices with some nervousness that these bonds will be very scarce going forward.""For decades, nonprofits and certain for-profit firms have been able to raise money the same way that state and local governments do: by issuing tax-exempt bonds for projects perceived to have a public benefit. The proceeds from these private-activity bonds -- which have averaged about $110 billion a year over the past decade -- help pay for everything from hospitals, nursing homes and college dorms to charter schools, housing and highways.Elected officials have been contemplating ending this tax exemption on private-activity bonds for several years. The current proposal states that $40 billion in additional tax revenue would be made available over the next decade if the exemption were removed.It is possible private-activity bonds could remain tax free if changes are made to the Republican House plan as it makes its way through Congress. But now that an actual proposal is on the table, those who follow the municipal-bond market are predicting that market will shrink if the exemption is gone and it will be more difficult to attract private investment to infrastructureAnalysts also expect a surge of tax-exempt borrowing by private companies and nonprofits rushing to use the exemption before it is gone.""The whole thing is quite shocking,"" said George Friedlander, managing partner at Court Street Group Research and a municipal-market veteran who has tracked tax policy since the 1980s.There was a time when private-activity bonds could be used to fund any project as long as a local-government official approved. Congress first established rules for private-activity bonds in 1968, offering a specific list of approved projects, including airports and low-income housing. In the 1980s, Congress added new types of private-activity bonds and capped how much nonprofits could issue, but the cap was lifted in the 1990s.The use of private-activity bonds has attracted criticism from some who argue that certain borrowers shouldn't be able to benefit from the exemption. A Congressional Budget Office report in December found that some projects financed with private-activity bonds ""probably would take place without a subsidy"" and others likely wouldn't be worth the cost.""We should question whether large hospitals and universities that take in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues should able to borrow at tax-exempt rates,"" said Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, a research group on economic-development incentives.Others say smaller nonprofits such as museums or charter schools might have trouble accessing the corporate-bond market and have to rely on bank loans. ""Or just let the roof leak,"" said Natalie Cohen, a senior analyst with Wells Fargo Securities.A letter to the House Ways and Means Committeeon Monday, signed by trade associations of hospitals, universities, engineers, airports, bond lawyers and public officials, said ending the tax exemption would ""undermine vital projects."""
Wells Fargo,U.S. Threatens to Derail AT&amp;amp;T Deal --- Antitrust regulators are pressing AT&amp;amp;T to sell either DirecTV or TV unit including CNN," Nov 9, 2017",,1,"U.S. antitrust regulators are pressing for major changes to AT&T Inc.'s proposed takeover of Time Warner Inc., demands that threaten one of the biggest media deals ever, people familiar with the matter said.The Justice Department has raised the prospect that the telecom giant would have to divest either the Turner television unit, which includes CNN along with other cable channels, or the satellite DirecTV business, the people said.The two sides have engaged in recent tense settlement discussions to address the agency's concerns about the transaction, which would put CNN, HBO and the Warner Bros. film studio under the same corporate roof as satellite broadcaster DirecTV and more than 100 million wireless users.AT&T and the Justice Department are far apart, and people involved in the discussions have differing views on the exchange of proposals. AT&T offered to sell the CNN business, but the agency rejected the idea, one person close to the negotiations said. AT&T denied it offered to sell the news network, which President Donald Trump has criticized as unfair to him.In a statement Wednesday, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said, ""Throughout this process, I have never offered to sell CNN and have no intention of doing so.""Rather than a major divestment, AT&T is preparing to fight any potential legal challenge in court, arguing the opposition is politically motivated since there is no overlap between the two companies' business lines, some of the people said.The Justice Department's recently confirmed antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has pledged that politics wouldn't play a role in enforcement decisions.""The department is committed to carrying out its duties in accordance with the laws and the facts,"" a spokesman said, declining to comment further on the investigation.The agency is laying the groundwork for a possible lawsuit to stop the deal while at the same time negotiating with company executives, The Wall Street Journal reported last week.A top AT&T executive had warned for the first time earlier Wednesday that the company was unsure about the timing of the takeover, which was valued at $85 billion when it was struck last year.""The timing of the closing of the deal is now uncertain,"" John Stephens, AT&T's chief financial officer, said Wednesday at a Wells Fargo conference in New York. Just a few weeks ago, he told investors the company still expected the transaction to close later this year.Shares of Time Warner fell 6% to $88.50 on Wednesday, while AT&T shares rose 1% to $33.44. AT&T shares have fallen sharply in recent weeks and Time Warner shares are trading at a wide discount to the implied offer price, as investors worry about the deal.The review reached a new level in recent weeks with the involvement of Mr. Delrahim, who received Senate confirmation in late September. Mr. Trump nominated Mr. Delrahim in April, but Senate delays in his confirmation left him on the sidelines while others in the Justice Department scrutinized the transaction.Mr. Delrahim is a critic of so-called behavioral remedies to address concerns about a merger, preferring that companies be required to sell off assets instead, a view he signaled last month in a public appearance at New York University. Antitrust observers took notice of the remarks and have wondered whether his views would make it harder for AT&T to offer concessions that the companies and the Justice Department would each find acceptable.During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump had attacked the proposed deal. ""AT&T is buying Time Warner, and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,"" he said. Mr. Trump has since avoided talking publicly about the transaction but frequently complained on Twitter about the way CNN has reported on him. CNN stood by its reporting.AT&T executives previously pledged not to sell CNN or interfere with its editorial operations. The Dallas-based telecom giant is looking for the deal to give it a bigger foray into advertising and new growth markets, as it struggles with increased competition in the mature wireless business and shrinking pay-TV market, especially in the DirecTV satellite service it bought in 2015.For Time Warner, the deal with AT&T is the culmination of years of moves by Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes, who spun off underperforming assets, leaving a media and entertainment-focused firm that was more appealing to an acquirer. Mr. Bewkes has argued that uniting content and distribution will help meet viewers' demands for more flexibility in the TV packages they buy and where they view content, with more video being watched on mobile devices.As the media industry evolves, even giant companies are looking to adapt. Rival Walt Disney Co. recently held talks to buy studios and other entertainment assets from 21st Century Fox Inc., seeking to gain more leverage in negotiations with distributors or to have more content for its own direct to consumer services. Wall Street Journal parent company News Corp and 21st Century Fox share common ownership.AT&T argues the deal would help consumers by making film and TV more affordable. AT&T points to its current moves to lower prices for video content, such as offering discounts for DirecTV Now, an online pay-TV service.""Vertical mergers like this one have always been approved because they benefit consumers without removing any competitors from the market,"" AT&T said last week. ""We see no reason in the law or the facts why this transaction should be an exception.""Several competitors including the Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.'s premium programming service Starz, and satellite broadcaster Dish Network Corp. have raised concerns about the deal, people familiar with the matter said.If the Justice Department were to sue to block the deal, that wouldn't be the end of the matter unless the companies abandoned their plans. The department would have to present its case to a federal judge and prove that the deal would likely harm competition.Such court battles remain rare, as the government and merging parties often find ways to settle their differences. There were, however, several major merger trials during the Obama era of antitrust enforcement, including two recent cases in which the Justice Department won rulings against a pair of major proposed deals in the health insurance industry."
Wells Fargo,Obituaries," Nov 11, 2017",,0,"Wells Fargo & Co. is having trouble doing right by the customers it has wronged.The big bank acknowledged that it recently sent out 38,000 erroneous communications to customers that it forced to buy unneeded auto insurance.In some cases, according to two people briefed on the matter, Wells Fargo has also sent refunds to people who weren't the bank's customers; notified those who were harmed of incorrect amounts to be paid; and told people of coming refunds though they had never gotten the insurance.In another matter, Wells Fargo has yet to begin a broad-based reach-out related to refunds for as many as 110,000 customers who were charged improper fees to extend interest-rate commitments they received from Wells Fargo on their mortgages, people familiar with the matter said.Wells Fargo will soon require mortgage customers to agree to a refund through the mail before sending them money and estimates half or fewer will do so, the people said.Catherine Pulley, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said in a statement: ""We are focused on making things right for our customers and ensuring this large-scale remediation happens correctly and as quickly as possible.""She said a Wells Fargo vendor working on the auto-insurance matter caught a coding mistake that resulted in 38,000 customers receiving a letter they didn't need with no checks included. Wells Fargo is working with the vendor ""to ensure these customers receive the appropriate communication -- including any refunds they're eligible for,"" she said. Ms. Pulley added that the bank is currently aware of one noncustomer having received a check.The problem mailings and refund delays are happening as the bank continues to grapple with regulatory scrutiny following its sales-practices misconduct.For those actions and others, the Fed earlier this month took the unprecedented action of restricting the bank's growth until ""it sufficiently improves its governance and controls.""That punishment followed a rebuke issued to Wells Fargo last fall by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Citing repeated deficiencies, the regulator warned the bank that it would likely face enforcement proceedings because of them.The OCC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, another regulator, are aware of the refund delays with mortgage customers and have been pressing the bank about them, a person familiar with the matter said. The regulators have also been involved with auto-lending refunds, approving different phases of the mailings.A spokesman for the OCC declined to comment. The CFPB declined to comment.Last summer, the bank said it had forced nearly 600,000 customers who financed their car purchases with Wells Fargo to pay for collision coverage they didn't need. The practices pushed 274,000 customers, among them active military service members, into delinquency on their auto loans, according to an internal report commissioned by the bank, and resulted in 20,000 wrongful car repossessions."
Wells Fargo,"Business News: For Toy Makers, a New Game"," Nov 15, 2017",,1,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average swung in a range of more than 500 points before closing slightly lower, extending a string of volatility as investors assess how the potential for higher interest rates would affect the nearly nine-year bull market.The blue-chip index has moved wildly this week, trading in its two biggest intraday ranges in history on Monday and Tuesday when the index swung 1,596.65 and 1,167.49 points, respectively.A recent rise in bond yields has stoked fears that a pickup in inflation could lead central banks to tighten monetary policy more quickly than expected, making stocks less attractive as interest rates rise. Those concerns helped push stocks sharply lower Friday and Monday when the Dow suffered its biggest one-session point decline on record. Tuesday's uneven session -- with 29 changes of direction for the Dow -- ended with sizable gains.Some investors said the declines were overdue and created a buying opportunity given favorable earnings growth that they think should help stocks continue marching higher. Still, others warn that technical selling drove the recent pullback rather than investors panicking, which might suggest more dips lie ahead.""We're just now digesting what's been a pretty violent reaction,"" said Jamie Robertson, senior portfolio manager of global asset allocation at Manulife Asset Management, which reduced stock positions recently but is now discussing increasing them. ""This is the type of market action you get once you've had a bit of a dust storm.""After spending most of Wednesday's session in positive territory and rising as much as 381 points, the Dow industrials turned lower toward the end of the day and closed down 19.42 points, or 0.1%, at 24893.35.

The S&P 500 energy sector fell 1.7%, bringing its losses in the past week to 8.2%. It has been the broader index's worst performer during that span.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.843% from 2.766% Tuesday. Yields rise as bond prices fall and were back near their four-year high hit last Friday.Some traders have said investors are adjusting to a new market backdrop following a historically calm period in the stock market and one of the best-ever starts to a year for global indexes.The Dow industrials are down more than 5% from their Jan. 26 record but still up 0.7% on the year.""I wouldn't say it's over yet,"" said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank. ""It wouldn't be surprising if we got a full 10% correction.""The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, known as the ""fear gauge"" for the U.S. stock market, fell after briefly hitting its highest intraday level since 2009 on Tuesday.Danna Pratte, owner of a nutritional supplements company in Phoenix, said she has been worried in recent days about some of the stocks she owns. But despite rising anxiety over recent market swings, Ms. Pratte, 45 years old, said she hasn't made any changes to her portfolio."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Signs of Tightening in Energy Emerge," Nov 16, 2017",,0,"The downgrade of the assessment, known as a CAMELS score, occurred over the summer of 2017, as Wells Fargo continued to grapple with issues related to how it treats customers. In September 2016, the bank settled allegations that it had years of improper sales practices that resulted in potentially 3.5 million accounts being opened without customers' knowledge.Elsewhere in the bank, more than 550,000 auto-loan and mortgage customers were potentially overcharged for products for years as well. Regulators' most recent concerns focus on the bank's overall approach to catching and preventing problems that can harm customers, a major part of risk management.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has been weighing a new enforcement action against the bank related to such risk controls, the Journal reported earlier this month.A Wells Fargo spokeswoman at the time declined to comment on the bank's CAMELS rating or any potential OCC actions. The spokeswoman then said the bank is ""very focused on prudent and effective risk management"" and continues to enhance those matters.Mr. Loughlin, 62 years old, has been with the bank or its predecessors for 36 years and has been chief risk officer since 2008. He reports directly to Wells Fargo Chief Executive Timothy Sloan and has served on the bank's operating committee of its top executives.Mr. Sloan said in a statement that Mr. Loughlin has served during ""some of the most critical times in our company's history,"" including the financial crisis and the bank's acquisition of Wachovia Corp.Since then, Mr. Loughlin has overseen risk matters related to credit, markets, operations, compliance and cybersecurity, according to the bank.Over the past two years, Mr. Loughlin also led a plan to centralize many of the company's risk functions. But Wells Fargo didn't always specify employees' new roles and responsibilities, current and former executives said. Regulators noticed the problems, and Mr. Loughlin had to submit a new risk framework to them in the first half of 2017, these executives said."
Wells Fargo,"MANSION --- Tech CEOS: Lie Low or Live Large? --- While some heads of richly valued 'unicorn' start-ups live modestly in the face of skeptical lenders and investor scrutiny, others have traded up; WeWork chief's stroller parking garage"," Nov 17, 2017",,1,"Alon Cohen and Adi Tatarko, founders of online home renovation and design platform Houzz, launched their company after running into difficulties remodeling their Palo Alto, Calif., home in 2009.Eight years later, though their company is valued at around $4 billion, the couple is still living in the same four-bedroom remodeled house.That may sound humble for the creators of a multibillion-dollar company, but there are reasons for hotshot chief executives to lay low. Startup founders are under intense scrutiny these days as questions emerge about whether the private markets may be in for a correction following several lackluster tech IPOs.The CEOs of tech ""unicorns"" -- large, well-funded startups that are valued at over $1 billion -- are under the microscope, since many raised money at ultrahigh valuations based on the promise of extreme growth that may, or may not, be realized.While not cheap, many homes of unicorn CEOs aren't mansions by San Francisco standards, and hardly compare to the vast Pacific Heights residences owned by the likes of Larry Ellison. Ben Silbermann, CEO of Pinterest, the $12.3 billion visual-search service, lives in a four-bedroom, $3.995 million home he purchased in the Fairmount Heights area in 2015, voting and property records show. Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb, recently moved out of the apartment he'd lived in since launching Airbnb in 2007 and into a $3.5 million, 3,225-square-foot home in the Mission neighborhood of San Francisco, according to public records and his spokesman.Bay Area real-estate agents say their clients are becoming reluctant to buy fancy homes, for fear of spooking investors wary of distracted or high-living founders. ""I had one very successful young guy recently who said he loved that the house looked modest on the outside but seemed much bigger once you were inside,"" says Nina Hatvany of Pacific Union, a San Francisco brokerage. ""He didn't want his colleagues or investors driving by and saying, 'Look, he bought a mansion.'""Some venture capitalists don't hesitate to make their views known when it comes to startup founders who spend lavishly on pricey real estate. ""It's not the best look,"" said Brendan Wallace, co-founder of Venice, Calif.-based venture firm Fifth Wall.A handful of entrepreneurs have bought big -- purchases that stand out as the market declines. Evan Spiegel, who heads Snap, the parent company of online messaging service Snapchat, bought a 7,164-square-foot Los Angeles mansion once owned by actor Harrison Ford for $12 million in May 2016, according to listing agent Stephen Shapiro of the Westside Estate Agency.With a pool, a gym and a guesthouse, the new spread hosted Mr. Spiegel's wedding to supermodel Miranda Kerr in May. Mr. Spiegel financed his purchase with an $8 million mortgage from Wells Fargo, public records show. Snap missed analysts' estimates for user growth and revenue in July, and its shares are now trading at $12.56, or 26% below their IPO price. Mr. Spiegel didn't respond to requests for comment.In April 2016, Matthew Salzberg, CEO of meal-kit provider Blue Apron, paid about $8.7 million for a three-bedroom, 2,871-square-foot apartment at 10 Madison Square West, a newly completed Manhattan condominium. Blue Apron's stock hit a new low earlier this month, plunging to $3.07, down from an initial public offering price of $10.Adam Neumann, CEO of unicorn workspace provider WeWork, has purchased homes in Manhattan, the Hamptons and in Westchester County. His company, which is still privately held, is valued at around $20 billion. Mr. Neumann has told friends and associates he sold more than $100 million of WeWork's shares, a large amount to sell before an IPO, according to business associates of Mr. Neumann.In 2014 Mr. Neumann bought a $10.5 million Greenwich Village townhouse, public records show. Built in the Greek Revival style, the six-bedroom home has been in a multiyear renovation that involves a major expansion of the basement and a structure called a ""stroller parking garage.""While work on the townhouse is under way, Mr. Neumann and his family are renting a four-bedroom, 4,207-square-foot apartment at the condominium building 18 Gramercy Park in Manhattan, according to public records and a person familiar with the deal. An apartment slightly larger than Mr. Neumann's in the same building is on the market asking $46,500 a month, according to StreetEasy.Last year, Mr. Neumann purchased the 60-acre Linden Farm estate in Westchester for $15 million, public records show. Built in 1929, it features a 13,700-square-foot main house, as well as a stable, a riding ring, a pool and a tennis court. In addition, he and his wife own a home in the Hamptons, purchased for $1.715 million in 2012, public records show. Critics of WeWork say WeWork's valuation is inflated, and it is a real-estate company masquerading as a tech play.In 2012, as online file-sharing company Dropbox became known as one of Silicon Valley's hottest commodities with a $4 billion valuation, founder Drew Houston paid $9.94 million for a penthouse apartment at one of San Francisco's most hyped properties, the 58-story Millennium Tower. Now the building is mired in lawsuits over reports that it is sinking (though still habitable); several mutual funds have written down the value of their Dropbox shares.It's always been challenging for startup founders to cash out early. Their net worths are usually tied up in company equity, so to make a large cash purchase they would either have to sell a lot of shares, or convince banks to lend them millions based on the presumed value of their stock. Lenders typically look unfavorably on buyers whose net worth is made up predominantly of equity in their own companies, while investors worry that share sales blunt the drive of their entrepreneurs, or indicate that a founder has lost faith in the business.""It's a risky and possibly an irrational thing to do -- to purchase a home you couldn't otherwise afford unless you get near-term liquidity on your startup's stock,"" says Mr. Wallace. ""Tech company valuations can change suddenly and dramatically in a positive or negative direction.""Chuck Green, owner of Bay Area Capital Funding, a mortgage brokerage in San Mateo County, says concern about inflated valuations is becoming a major problem when it comes to financing the luxury homes of Silicon Valley executives. Mr. Green says he has one client with an ""enormous number"" of shares vested in a company that has not yet gone public, but lenders won't take it into account when considering him for a loan.""A lender looks at that and says, 'We have no idea what the value of those shares are, so we'll value them at zero,'"" Mr. Green says. Ms. Hatvany, the San Francisco agent, says the issue may be impacting the high-end of the market in San Francisco, which has been slower over the past year.As the last dot-com bust proved, Bay Area homes can be more enduring than the startups that paid for them. Eric Greenberg says he paid $16.1 million for a 3-acre estate in the tony Northern California enclave of Ross. He bought the home when the market was hot and he was a rising star for founding internet consulting company Scient, says agent Olivia Hsu Decker. Elton John sang at Mr. Greenberg's wedding.By 2002, Scient had filed for bankruptcy protection; it is no longer in operation. Ms. Hsu Decker recently listed Mr. Greenberg's home for $18.8 million."
Wells Fargo,Wells Fargo Fires A Top Official," Nov 18, 2017",,0,"Wells Fargo & Co. fired its head of consumer lending, Franklin Codel, for critical comments he made about regulators to a former employee, according to a people familiar with the matter.The abrupt dismissal of the 23-year Wells Fargo veteran, one of the top dozen officials at the bank, highlights the tense environment at the lender as it sorts through a variety of regulatory probes stemming from sales-practice issues in its retail bank.Specifically, Mr. Codel was fired Thursday over a disparaging remark he made about regulators to Greg Gwizdz, a senior mortgage official who worked under Mr. Codel and was terminated earlier this year, people familiar with the matter said.Mr. Codel's remarks related to how so-called golden parachute payments had been limited at the bank because of its regulatory problems last year, one of the people said.Mr. Gwizdz reported Mr. Codel's comment to the bank, which reported it to its regulators. Though it isn't uncommon for bankers to make disparaging remarks about regulators in private, one person familiar with the matter said that given Wells Fargo's position with a bevy of investigations, it felt the need to act.""Wells has to be very thoughtful and careful here,"" this person said, ""What others may do, they can't.""Timothy Sloan, Wells Fargo's CEO, said in a statement that as ""difficult as this situation is, the decision reflects our commitment to our values and culture.""Mr. Gwizdz, who couldn't be reached to comment, was fired over the summer related to the regulatory problems within Wells Fargo's mortgage division. A 26-year veteran of the bank, Mr. Gwizdz had previously overseen Wells Fargo's roughly 7,900 mortgage-loan officers.Golden-parachute payments are controversial with some regulators and investors, typically going to exiting executives as a sort of parting gift for years of service. They can add up to several years' worth of pay in stock grants, options and bonuses all at once. In recent years, banks have clawed back or withheld such payments from executives when their conduct leads to regulatory fines or losses.The restrictions on the payments at Wells Fargo affected Mr. Gwizdz, who had led the national sales team for the bank's mortgage division, one of the people said.Regulations of golden parachute payments for the bank are administered by all the bank's main regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Last year, the OCC restricted Wells Fargo's ability to give the payments.In a brief interview Friday, Mr. Codel said he was ""proud of my career with Wells Fargo"" but declined to comment on details of his firing, saying additional questions should be directed to the bank.Mr. Codel's firing comes more than a year after it was discovered that Wells Fargo was involved in a sales scandal that is now expected to have resulted in the creation of as many as 3.5 million accounts using fictitious or unauthorized customer information. He wasn't directly implicated in that scandal.The company said in July it would refund $80 million to customers who had been incorrectly charged for auto insurance.The bank then said 570,000 customers could have been affected. In October, the bank said it would refund around 110,000 mortgage customers who may have wrongfully paid fees for mortgage lock extensions."

Wells Fargo,Departing Regulator Would Answer Call --- Acting comptroller won't rule out another public role 'if right person aske'd," Nov 20, 2017",,1,"Washington may not have heard the last of Keith Noreika. The acting comptroller of the currency is ending an eventful and unusual tenure in charge of a federal banking regulator, where he spent about 200 days criticizing other regulators, unilaterally changing policies and provoking arguments. With his successor, former banker Joseph Otting, set to be sworn in Monday, Mr. Noreika said in an interview Friday that he was ready for a vacation stretching into 2018 but wasn't ready to rule out taking a future job in public service.""If the right person asked me and the right job presented itself and it was the right time in my life, absolutely I would answer the call,"" he said, adding that he had received offers. ""There are a lot of people in government who want me to do a lot of things.""""On the other hand,"" he said, ""I am not the person who either wants to or feels comfortable being in the public sector for most of my life.""Mr. Noreika said he hadn't yet discussed returning to his old job at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, where he was a partner before being appointed in early May as temporary head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates federally chartered banks, including many of the nation's largest.His quick transition from banking lawyer to bank regulator drew bipartisan concern, particularly given that his status as a temporary government employee allowed him to skirt ethics restrictions that would normally apply to someone at the head of the OCC, including restrictions on his ability to work with banks after leaving government.Those criticisms grew louder as he took actions that could benefit former clients such as Wells Fargo & Co., including loudly opposing a rule from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that would have made it easier for people to sue banks in groups by limiting the use of arbitration in financial contracts. Congress scrapped the rule last month.""My client was the American people for the last six months, and hopefully I have advocated their interest to the best of my ability,"" said Mr. Noreika when asked about those criticisms. He said the policy changes he made aimed to reduce excessive regulations and help the economy.Taking the comptroller job, he said, ""is obviously buying me a lot of postemployment restrictions, and maybe you don't feel those are enough, but there are a lot of them that last longer than my tenure here, including the self-imposed ones.""Mr. Noreika has said he would voluntarily submit to a one-year cooling-off period during which he won't represent clients before the OCC.Looking back on his brief tenure, Mr. Noreika said he hoped he had rebalanced the OCC to empower rank-and-file bank supervisors -- a dig at his predecessor, former Comptroller Thomas Curry, who some viewed as asserting more control over major supervisory decisions.""We have made a lot of progress really communicating to the supervisory staff that they are there for a reason, that we trust their judgment and that it is up to them to sort of set the priorities for their institution and spot the risks because they are the boots on the ground,"" Mr. Noreika said. ""I think we have become a little bit centralized here in Washington and that doesn't always make for the best supervision, certainly not the best morale, and not the best policy either.""Mr. Curry has said he made changes to ensure consistency in the OCC's decisions and to reduce the perception that the regulator was too cozy with the banks it oversees. In a May interview, Mr. Curry said he ""never questioned the technical experience and competence of the OCC and its supervisors"" and ""I think most people [at the OCC] have embraced change.""Mr. Noreika said he thought he had helped start ""a conversation, a very healthy one, on right sizing of regulation.""One of his proudest moments, he said, was his public criticism of the CFPB's arbitration rule.The consumer bureau said the rule would leave consumers better off. Mr. Noreika disagreed, in trademark fashion: He repeatedly questioned both the bureau's analysis and its motives, sounding at times more like a politician than a bank regulator.After Congress voted to extinguish the rule, Mr. Noreika issued a public statement declaring ""a new day in Washington, when policy makers are actually concerned about the consequences that regulations have on working Americans."""
Wells Fargo,Loan Growth Hits a Rut," Nov 27, 2017",,0,"Loan growth at banks is slowing, casting a cloud over what was supposed to have been a banner year for financial institutions following last November's elections.The rate of 12-month loan growth at U.S. banks in the third quarter hit its lowest level since the end of 2013, according to data released last week by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. That marked the sixth consecutive quarter of decline for this measure of loan growth.Growth in each of the four major lending categories measured by the FDIC fell. Notably, the growth rate for business lending, an important source of revenues for banks in recent years, plumbed its lowest level since the first quarter of 2011.While loan balances are still rising, the slowing rate of growth has defied the expectations of bankers. Many have spent the year looking for growth-reviving catalysts that never came and remain puzzled by the slowdown.Even more surprising is that falling rates of loan growth are occurring as many signals point to a more buoyant U.S. economy. Unemployment continues to decline, gross domestic product growth came in at 3% in the third quarter and business investment is rising.Tepid rates of loan growth along with continued low long-term interest rates have taken some of the sizzle out of bank stocks. Financial shares were among the chief beneficiaries of last November's election surprise, soaring on hopes of a tax-code overhaul, lighter regulation and stronger economic growth. With progress in these areas uneven during 2017, gains are more muted.The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, a measure of 24 of the largest commercial banks, is up about 8% since the start of the year, about half the rise of the S&P 500.""There was such enthusiasm coming out of the election,"" said Gerard Cuddy, CEO of Beneficial Bancorp Inc., a community lender in Philadelphia. ""I think reality is setting in.""The slowdown in lending growth raises questions about firms' prospects for 2018, especially given that long-term interest rates haven't moved much, even as short-term ones are climbing. The difference, or spread, between 10-year and two-year U.S. Treasury debt, a rough proxy for bank profitability, is around 0.6 percentage point, its lowest level in a decade.If loans balances aren't growing briskly and the interest-rate spread is narrow, it is far tougher for banks to increase net-interest income.""The plane used to be flying at 30,000 feet, now it's at 10,000,"" said Christopher Marinac, director of research at investment-banking boutique FIG Partners. ""There are many banks that are concerned about how much they can grow the loan book in 2018.""At the biggest U.S. banks, loan growth in the third quarter was spotty. At J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp., total loans grew 3% from a year earlier. Citigroup Inc. posted growth of 2%, while total loans at Wells Fargo & Co. fell 1%.Loan growth was anemic among many smaller banks. At BB&T Corp., total loans in the third quarter were roughly flat compared with a year earlier. In an earnings call last month, CEO Kelly King said more clients were taking advantage of low rates in the bond markets and paying off their bank loans. Hurricanes in the southern U.S. also had an effect.He added the bank is purposely restructuring its loan portfolio to focus on more-profitable loans. Still, Mr. King nodded at deeper issues around the downshift, saying ""the mega issue here is that, you know, we've been on a nine-year slow economy.""An area of particular concern for all banks is business lending. In the third quarter, the 12-month growth rate for business loans fell to 2.48% from 2.79% the prior quarter and 7.67% a year earlier.The drop-off is even more pronounced based on weekly Federal Reserve data. Commercial and industrial loans, or business lending, in early November were up less than 1% from a year prior, the data show.From mid-2014 through mid-2016, growth of such loans was regularly in the double digits. This is putting 2017 on track to be the worst year for business-loan growth since 2010, when the economy was still wrestling with the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis.It remains unclear why. Throughout the year, some banks have said more subdued business lending was due to a lack of clarity from Washington on the fate of initiatives on taxes and health care.Such worries should eventually fade, though, said Darren King, finance chief at M&T Bank Corp., where loans in the third quarter were down 2% versus a year earlier. ""Business owners are eventually going to get to the point where they say, 'I can't wait to find out what is going to happen in Washington,'"" he said.Even so, ""that doesn't mean I think we're going back to 2015 or 2016 levels"" of loan growth, Mr. King added.Some bankers also have cited heightened competition. More business customers are tapping the bond market instead of bank loans to take advantage of low interest rates there, while insurance companies are offering to fund 30-year commercial mortgages and hedge funds are lending to riskier companies.Others think the slowdown in business lending is a hangover from above-average growth in recent years. Many potential corporate clients are already loaded up on debt, said Kevin Barker, an analyst at Piper Jaffray & Co. That tamps down demand for loans. It also makes some banks wary of lending even more to these companies, he added."
Wells Fargo,"Wells Fargo Bankers, Chasing Bonuses, Overcharged Clients --- Employees say foreign-currency staff ignored agreed-upon client fees"," Nov 28, 2017",,0,"The whispers among employees had been around for years. They finally heard some facts during a conference call in June led by managers in Wells Fargo & Co.'s foreign-exchange operation: Some of its business customers had been cheated, according to two employees who were on the call.An internal review showed that out of roughly300 fee agreements based on anything from informal handshakes to emails to signed documents, only about 35 companies were charged the actual price they had been offered for currency trades handled by Wells Fargo, the employees say.The phone call was part of a continuing cleanup that has led Wells Fargo to fire four foreign-exchange bankers and federal prosecutors to open their own investigation of the operation, people familiar with the matter have said.""Wells Fargo remains committed to our foreign exchange business,"" the bank said in a statement Monday. ""If we find a problem, we fix it."" The bank said its foreign-exchange business is ""under new management.""The business is tiny compared with foreign-exchange operations at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. but could become another huge headache for the San Francisco bank, still grappling with fallout from the sales-practices scandal in its retail operations. The scandal led to last year's abrupt retirement of Wells Fargo's chief executive, a $185 million regulatory settlement and numerous federal and state investigations, which are continuing.Wells Fargo retail employees had to hit lofty goals to keep their jobs or get bonuses, which led some employees to open potentially 3.5 million accounts with fictitious or unauthorized customer information from 2009 to 2015.Foreign-exchange employees got bonuses based solely on how much revenue they brought in, say more than a dozen current or former Wells Fargo employees. No other big bank in the U.S. calculated bonuses of currency traders in such a defined and individual way. Wells Fargo said Monday that it began making changes to those compensation plans earlier this year.The bank also charged some of the highest trading fees around, according to current and former employees. For more than a decade, customers were sometimes charged anywhere from 1% to 4% on basic transactions such as converting euros to dollars and complicated trades like hedging.Those percentages can be at least two to eight times higher than the middle-market industry average of 0.15% to 0.5%, depending on the trade, customer and volume, according to foreign-exchange bankers throughout the industry.Wells Fargo disputes the descriptions of its foreign-exchange fees by current and former employees. The bank said Monday its fees in 2016 had a weighted average of 0.09 percentage point across all transaction sizes. Clients served by its middle-market banking team were charged a weighted average of 0.18 percentage point, according to Wells Fargo.Some foreign-exchange bankers at Wells Fargo relied on the fact that customers often didn't bother to double-check how much they were charged, fee levels weren't straightforward, and complaints could be batted away, the current and former employees say.One former Wells Fargo manager says employees would tell customers who expressed surprise at the size of a trading fee that market prices were different at the moment when the transaction was executed and blame ""time fluctuation"" for any difference.The bank's foreign-exchange customers have included telecommunications firm CenturyLink Inc., vehicle-parts supplier Federal-Mogul Holdings Corp. and nonprofit groups such as the National Bone Marrow Donor Program.Regulators have been investigating the foreign-exchange business at Wells Fargo, including a big trade involving Restaurant Brands International Inc., the owner of Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, according to people familiar with the matter."
Wells Fargo,Business &amp;amp; Finance," Nov 30, 2017",,0,"The trade resulted in a loss to Restaurant Brands, people familiar with the matter have said, which led to a dispute between the Oakville, Ontario, company and the bank. The dispute centered on how bank employees handled the trade, rather than its pricing. Wells Fargo refunded about $900,000 to Restaurant Brands, people familiar with the refund say.The foreign-exchange business's problems run far deeper than what is known inside Wells Fargo as ""the Burger King trade"" or what has been previously reported. The extent of the trouble seems to have become apparent to top Wells Fargo executives earlier this year.The business was moved in early 2017 from Wells Fargo's international division into its investment-banking and capital-markets operation. Since then, executives have changed internal systems, added more stringent rules around pricing and required more frequent compliance checks, current and former employees say.Issues with the Burger King trade were found following those checks and customer complaints, people familiar with the matter say. The continuing internal review of Wells Fargo's foreign-exchange operation is separate from the review sparked by the sales scandal, some of the people said.A compliance training session in early November detailed what Wells Fargo called ""approved margins"" for different volumes of foreign-exchange transactions, according to an internal document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Employees say fee levels remain higher than industry norms, and some compensation practices aren't due to change until next year.Foreign-exchange trading has been a problem area for many banks. In 2015, several large U.S. and European banks agreed to multibillion-dollar settlements with U.S. regulators and pleaded guilty to criminal charges filed by U.S. authorities over alleged collusion among currency traders.Bank of New York Mellon Corp. agreed in 2015 to pay $714 million to resolve allegations it defrauded pension funds and other clients by overcharging them on currency transactions. State Street Corp. agreed in 2016 to pay $530 million to settle similar allegations.Both banks admitted giving some clients far worse pricing on currency transactions than the banks implied the clients would get.The Journal reported in October that the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California is investigating the Restaurant Brands currency trade and has subpoenaed information from Wells Fargo.Potential issues related to that trade also are being examined by the Federal Reserve, the Journal reported. Examiners from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are auditing Wells Fargo's foreign-exchange business, according to employees at the bank. A Wells Fargo executive says the audit is ""normal course of business.""Current and former bank employees say its pricing practices were rooted in a culture and compensation system that looked to maximize revenue. Bonuses were defined as 10% of revenues exceeding revenue targets.If a banker's revenue target was $5 million and the person brought in $6 million, he or she would earn a $100,000 bonus, or 10% of the additional $1 million in revenue. Bankers typically received such bonuses twice a year in cash, rather than stock, as part of a signed contract, they added.It's rare among foreign-exchange groups in other banks to have so-called defined-bonus plans focused on individual earnings, according to people in the industry.After Wells Fargo moved the foreign-exchange business into its investment bank earlier this year, managers began telling employees that bonuses would become ""discretionary"" by the end of 2017. Under this more typical arrangement, management would decide employee bonuses, and bankers wouldn't know exactly how much they would receive. It would be based on a variety of factors, not just revenue.Wells Fargo has 18 foreign-exchange sales and trading offices, including in New York, San Francisco, Charlotte, N.C., London and Hong Kong. A few hundred people work in the group world-wide.Current and former employees say Wells Fargo's foreign-exchange customers are largely midsize businesses that don't tend to trade in large volumes. As a result, those clients don't have the same insight into the market as larger firms that are more-active traders.Some Wells Fargo clients have complained to the bank. In November 2016, Ecolab Inc., a water, hygiene and energy company based in St. Paul, Minn., bought and sold currency in a so-called swap arranged by the bank, according to people familiar with the deal. These people say Wells Fargo collected 1% on one part of the $100 million deal.After Ecolab compared the full trade, including fees, to overall market prices, the company contested the bank's fee. Wells Fargo refunded hundreds of thousands of dollars to Ecolab in December 2016, according to current and former employees.A spokeswoman for Ecolab confirmed the details of the trade and said it was the only fee issue Ecolab had with Wells Fargo.Fee issues arose for some Wells Fargo clients even when they had a pricing agreement. The bank agreed within the past 18 months to a specified rate with data-management firm Veritas Technologies LLC, according to bank employees. After making one trade on behalf of Veritas, Wells Fargo bankers told Veritas that the bank's fee was 0.05 percentage point higher than the agreed rate, the employees say.The result: The bank made an extra $50,000 on a $100 million trade, the employees say. Wells Fargo later made a refund to Veritas, according to people familiar with the matter. A Veritas spokeswoman declined to comment.Wells Fargo's foreign-exchange business also charged unusually high fees for trades with different currency conversions, known as ""Bswift"" transactions, current and former employees say.""And if anybody did complain, it was an easy tap dance,"" one former employee says. He says employees would say the pricing had been done automatically by the bank's computer system so ""there's no accountability for the spread.""Wells Fargo sent an internal email Nov. 2 detailing new guidelines for Bswift transactions, according to a copy of the email reviewed by the Journal. The guidelines include specific handling and pricing procedures for those trades.The operation also charged high fees to other parts of Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo Rail, which leases locomotives and railcars, and the bank's corporate-trust division are often charged 1% to 1.5% on currency transactions, according to current and former employees.The bank's foreign-exchange management often celebrated big trades and the money they made for the bank, the current and former employees say. Sara Wardell-Smith, who led the foreign-exchange group, emailed the group to hail big trades, naming clients and spelling out revenue generated. The employees say managers used to encourage employees to ring a brass bell in the San Francisco office when the bank made a lot of money on a trade.In mid-October, the bank announced that Ms. Wardell-Smith would lead its financial institutions group in the Americas region, according to a memo reviewed by the Journal and confirmed by a bank spokeswoman.Current employees say the move was viewed within Wells Fargo as a demotion, coming just months after Ms. Wardell-Smith had been promoted to co-lead the bank's division focusing on trading of rates, currencies and commodities. She didn't respond to requests for comment.The other co-leader, Ben Bonner, now leads that group on his own and is overseeing foreign-exchange trading, a bank spokeswoman confirms.Mr. Bonner has been working with other executives to fix the problems in the currency business, according to several current employees.Last month, the bank sent a memo to foreign-exchange employees that instructs them not to create informal or oral pricing agreements. The memo, reviewed by the Journal, also said employees are ""responsible for ensuring customers are not misled regarding"" pricing.Current and former employees say some Wells Fargo employees expressed concerns about pricing practices to top executives before the bank's internal cleanup efforts began earlier this year. Some employees say they were reluctant to press for sweeping changes, citing what they saw happen to one manager in the foreign-exchange operation about a decade ago.During a meeting of foreign-exchange managers in the mid-2000s, Cathy Witt said it wasn't right to celebrate high fees by ringing a bell, people familiar with the situation say. Ms. Witt, an employee in the bank's Chicago foreign-exchange group, warned that Wells Fargo could become known as a ""bucket shop,"" a derisive term for a disreputable finance firm, some of the people say.A few weeks later, Ms. Witt was summoned to a meeting in St. Louis, told that her comments had been offensive and demoted on the spot, according to people familiar with the matter. She also was told to apologize to other managers for her unprofessional behavior, the people say. She later left the bank."

Wells Fargo,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Morgan Stanley to Offer Automated Advice," Dec 5, 2017",,0,"A federal regulator has advised Wells Fargo & Co.'s board of directors that it is weighing a formal enforcement action against the bank over improprieties in its auto-insurance and mortgage operations.In a harshly worded letter sent earlier this month, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the bank's chief regulators, said Wells Fargo had willingly harmed its customers in those two business lines and had until Nov. 24 to respond, according to people familiar with the matter. The letter said the bank repeatedly failed to correct problems in a broad range of areas, not just the auto-insurance and mortgage-lending units, the people said.Wells Fargo declined to acknowledge the letter or comment on its response. More generally, in a statement, the bank said there ""is still work to be done,"" and that it ""is dedicated to making things right, fixing the problems, and building a better bank.""The bank said it is making changes ""across our risk management functions and line of business operations to rebuild the trust of our customers and team members.""An OCC spokesman declined to comment on a continuing regulatory matter.The OCC's letter to the Wells Fargo directors centers on irregularities in two of the bank's operations -- auto insurance and mortgage lending -- both of which have emerged this year.This summer, the bank conceded in a news release that for years it had forced nearly 600,000 customers who financed their car purchases with Wells Fargo to pay for collision coverage they didn't need. The bank said about 20,000 customers had their cars wrongly repossessed. Those customers failed to pay the improper insurance charges.Wells Fargo has said it would provide cash reimbursements totaling about $100 million to customers and make $30 million in account adjustments related to the insurance improprieties.The bank has also said it charged some customers improper fees to extend the interest-rate commitments they received from Wells Fargo on their mortgage applications. In October the bank said it is reaching out to around 110,000 customers who paid a total of $98 million in such fees, and expects refunds to be lower than that total because, the bank said, it ""believes a substantial number of those fees were appropriately charged under its policy.""The enforcement action being weighed against Wells Fargo is a cease-and-desist order, the people familiar with the matter said. Also known as a consent order, it is among an array of formal enforcement proceedings the OCC can take when it determines that deficiencies in a bank's operations are severe, uncorrected, unsafe or unsound. The issuance of a consent order typically includes steps the bank's board or management must take to correct the deficiencies and a time period for doing so.The OCC's letter underscores the continuing challenges faced by Wells Fargo as it seeks to emerge from a widespread scandal that came to a head last year. It involved disclosures that Wells Fargo had created as many as 3.5 million accounts using fictitious or unauthorized customer information. Any new sanction by regulators could further dent the bank's reputation and could provide ammunition for private lawsuits against the company.Last year's disclosure about the unauthorized accounts led the OCC to issue Wells Fargo a cease-and-desist order. The regulator levied penalties of $35 million in that September 2016 action, stipulating that Wells Fargo's board ""achieves and maintains an enterprisewide risk-management program designed to prevent and detect unsafe or unsound sales practices.""Several weeks after that, the OCC placed additional limitations on the bank, including preventing so-called golden parachutes for departing executives. Those limitations are still in place, people close to the bank have said.In August, The Wall Street Journal reported that the OCC was considering taking further action.Wells Fargo also had to pay restitution to customers who were harmed by the practices. The scandal led to the forced departure of Wells Fargo's chief executive.A spokesman for the OCC, which has broad power to restrict acquisitions and other banking activities, said ""the vast majority"" of letters warning companies that they may be subject to a cease-and-desist order result in such formal orders.In the past five years, Wells Fargo has received four new cease-and-desist orders from the comptroller of the currency; in two of those actions, including the one involving the opening of unrequested accounts, the regulator assessed a total of $55 million in penalties.If the OCC issues the order against Wells Fargo, it would probably include penalties against the institution, the people familiar with the matter said. It is unclear what those penalties would be.Wells Fargo is the nation's third-largest bank, with almost $2 trillion in assets. Last month, the bank reported third-quarter net income of $4.6 billion, even after higher legal and other costs from its sales-practice scandal.In a sign last month that a regulatory action against the bank might be imminent, the OCC issued a confidential report to Wells Fargo criticizing its auto-insurance practices and its handling of the problems after they had been identified.That report, reviewed by the Journal, gave the bank credit for identifying the irregularities in its insurance operations but characterized Wells Fargo's management of compliance risk as ""weak."" The report also said the bank had underestimated the amount of restitution it owed to wronged customers.Wells Fargo has been reshaping its board, which shareholders have criticized for its handling of a string of scandals involving the company's business practices.The company on Wednesday said it will add three new independent directors Jan. 1, including Celeste Clark, Kellogg Co.'s former chief sustainability officer and public policy and external relations officer, whom the company said will bring needed expertise on social and governance matters."
Wells Fargo,Trump Criticizes Wells," Dec 9, 2017",,1,"Morgan Stanley launched an automated-advisory service, the latest wealth-management firm to expand digital offerings in a bid for younger investors' assets.The New York brokerage firm said its Access Investing ""robo"" service became available Monday to clients with at least $5,000 to invest. The service will charge 0.35% of assets annually. Fees exclude those levied by fund managers.By comparison, Bank of America Corp.'s Merrill Lynch charges 0.45% for a similar offering open to clients with at least $5,000. The robo service run by Wells Fargo & Co.'s wealth-management arm charges 0.50% and has a $10,000 account minimum. Robo pioneer Betterment LLC has no account minimum and charges 0.25% annually for its basic offering.Morgan Stanley's advisers, like those at rivals, will have the ability to offer discounts. Brokers will receive referral bonuses for bringing clients onto the robo service.Executives said Morgan Stanley's robo launch is meant to attract a new generation of clients, many of them the children of existing customers positioned to inherit significant wealth. ""Access Investing is an opportunity for financial advisers to grow their book of business by making connections early,"" said Naureen Hassan, chief digital officer.The industry has long struggled with retaining accounts that move from parents to children who grew up in the digital age. Researcher Cerulli Associates has estimated the robo advice industry had more than $80 billion in assets by the end of 2016 and will have $385 billion in the next five years, eating into the multitrillion-dollar asset base of traditional brokerage firms.Similar to others' robo offerings, Morgan Stanley's automated-investing service relies on an algorithm to gauge an investor's risk appetite and then recommend an appropriate portfolio of funds that it automatically rebalances.Morgan Stanley's robo service will offer access to call centers in Florida and Utah, staffed by representatives who will offer basic assistance. The representatives aren't financial advisers.In addition to offering a selection of passive mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that aim to track market indexes, Morgan Stanley's menu includes actively managed products that seek to beat the market. The service also offers ""thematic portfolio"" options, with themes including sustainability and gender diversity. Executives say such options are meant to appeal to younger investors who show particular interest in socially responsible investing.Morgan Stanley said the Access Investing robo service is a core piece of its developing digital strategy. The offering's capabilities, which include goals-based planning tools, will be available to all clients, executives said."
Wells Fargo,Strong Hiring Keeps Treasurys Down," Dec 9, 2017",,1,"President Donald Trump threw himself into a debate about the direction of a consumer-finance regulator, pledging punishment for Wells Fargo & Co. despite his administration's promise to ease postcrisis financial regulation.In a Twitter post Friday morning, the president wrote that the bank, which in late 2016 was hit with a sales-practices scandal, should pay fines for ""bad acts against their customers."" He was responding to a news report about the regulator, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, reviewing whether there should be fines against the bank for its mortgage problems. He wrote strongly in favor of punishing the bank, which besides the sales-practices scandal has been beset by problems in its mortgage business as well as other divisions.""Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped, as has incorrectly been reported, but will be pursued and, if anything, substantially increased,"" the president tweeted. ""I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!""A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment.""It's deeply inappropriate for the president to weigh in on the actions of an independent financial regulator on a specific company before action is taken,"" said Aaron Klein, policy director at Brookings Institution's Center on Regulation and Markets.Others cautioned big banks that the tweet showed they remain political targets despite a business-friendly White House."
Wells Fargo,KKR Acts To Bolster Its Direct Lending," Dec 12, 2017",,1,"Business development companies are publicly listed investment vehicles that are exempt from corporate taxes. They make loans to other companies and pay out the high yields they receive to shareholders in the form of taxable dividends. A Business & Finance article Tuesday about KKR & Co.'s direct lending business didn't make clear who pays taxes on the BDCs' income.(WSJ Dec. 14, 2017)KKR & Co. has struck a deal to boost its direct lending business by $14 billion in a move that furthers the private-equity firm's transformation into a high-yield debt powerhouse.Asset managers have been piling into direct lending in recent years as a way to expand business while making higher-yielding investments. Banks pulled out of the so-called middle market after the financial crisis, creating an opportunity for investment firms to fill the gap with high-yielding loans of their own. Such loans have become more attractive for investors as low interest rates have dragged down yields in public high-yield debt markets.KKR is replacing Blackstone Group LP as the managers of about $14 billion in assets under management for FS Investment Corp., an operator of business development corporations, or BDCs, the companies said Monday. The publicly listed investment vehicles make tax-exempt loans to small and medium-size companies with below-investment-grade credit ratings. They pay out the high yields they receive on the loans to shareholders in dividends.KKR already operates two BDCs with about $4.5 billion of assets under the Corporate Capital Trust brand, and the firm will seek shareholder approval to merge them into the FS Investment BDCs. The resulting $18 billion fund would be the largest BDC in operation, accounting for 30% of the total $59.2 billion BDC assets, according to data from Wells Fargo Securities.Separately, EIG Global Energy Partners will take over investments of a $4.4 billion FS Investment BDC focused on energy and power companies."
Wells Fargo,U.S. News: Bank Flagged Manafort Business --- Some $30 million in cash flows linked to Trump's ex-manager raised suspicions," Dec 15, 2017",,1,"Deutsche Bank AG earlier this year flagged around $30 million in potentially suspicious transactions as part of an internal investigation into its role as a conduit for money involving Paul Manafort or people and entities connected to him, according to a person briefed on the matter.The findings, which were discussed inside Deutsche Bank in late spring and early summer, primarily concerned cash flows tied to Mr. Manafort, who for about five months in 2016 was President Donald Trump's campaign chairman, and Mr. Manafort's former business partner Richard Gates III, the person said.Deutsche Bank is a major correspondent bank for U.S. dollar transactions around the world. Correspondent banks serve as middlemen in international transactions, facilitating transfers for other banks into countries where they have limited or no operations. Banks can label transactions as suspicious based on origin of funds, specific concerns about parties involved or other reasons.The discussions at the bank coincided roughly with the appointment in May of Robert Mueller as U.S. special counsel to probe Russia's meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to people familiar with the matter.As scrutiny around several of Mr. Trump's former advisers was heating up, Deutsche Bank executives were assessing the bank's role in handling hundreds of transactions that might have involved people in Mr. Trump's orbit, have originated in Russia, or both, said some of the people familiar with the matter.In recent months, the German lender has received several subpoenas in Mr. Mueller's investigation, according to some of the people. A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman declined to comment on any flagged transactions and referred to a previous statement that the bank ""takes its legal obligations seriously and remains committed to cooperating with authorized investigations into this matter.""Deutsche Bank previously reported some of the transactions to U.S. anti-financial-crime authorities and shared at least some of its internal findings with officials in the U.S., said the person briefed on the matter. In October, Messrs. Manafort and Gates pleaded not guilty to a dozen criminal counts including money laundering and conspiracy against the U.S. The indictment alleged the men laundered money through a series of transactions involving foreign bank accounts. Mr. Manafort's spokesman declined to comment. Mr. Gates's lawyer declined to comment.It couldn't be determined whether the transactions highlighted in Messrs. Manafort and Gates's indictment were among those flagged by Deutsche Bank.Deutsche Bank flagged transactions that occurred from roughly 2010 to 2015, according to the person briefed on the matter. The person said the bulk of the payments highlighted in the internal probe happened between 2012 and 2014.The indictment doesn't identify banks involved in the transactions it cites. Deutsche Bank hasn't been accused of wrongdoing.Prosecutors accused Mr. Manafort of avoiding taxes and financing a ""lavish"" lifestyle using income he earned while lobbying for the pro-Russian government of Ukraine between 2006 and 2016. The indictment charged that he used a network of foreign corporate entities and accounts based in Cyprus and elsewhere.The bank's receipt of a subpoena in Mr. Mueller's investigation was reported last week by several media outlets including The Wall Street Journal. The Journal reported that the special counsel sought documents and data related to people or entities affiliated with the president.Jay Sekulow, a spokesman for Mr. Trump's legal team, said: ""Deutsche Bank hasn't received subpoenas on the president, the president's businesses or the president's family."" Moscow has denied meddling in the election, and Mr. Trump has called the special counsel's investigation a ""witch hunt.""The Deutsche Bank internal probe related to Mr. Manafort focused in large part on its role as correspondent bank, the person briefed on the matter said.Some of the money Deutsche Bank handled appeared to originate with Russian or Turkish entities, the person said. Some payments came through Cyprus banks into an account or accounts in the U.S. at Wachovia Corp., now owned by Wells Fargo & Co., people familiar with the matter said.Wells Fargo has received at least one subpoena related to Mr. Mueller's investigation, according to one of those people. The bank is complying with information requests, some as recent as last week, and is in the process of providing information to the government, that person said. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Mr. Mueller's office."
Wells Fargo,Tax Plan Likely to Boost Dollar --- Repatriation of profits is expected to bolster the currency -- but how long will rally last?," Dec 26, 2017",,1,"A provision of the tax overhaul is expected to release a tide of U.S. corporate cash from abroad, a development likely to jolt the dollar and reverberate throughout financial markets early next year.Companies could bring back as much as $400 billion, according to one estimate, as they take advantage of a one-time cut for repatriation of earnings and cash held overseas written into the GOP tax overhaul. That typically requires them to sell foreign holdings and buy assets denominated in dollars, which could boost the U.S. currency.Gauging the dollar's trajectory is crucial to both investors and corporations. The currency's climb over the past several years has been blamed for pressuring profits among U.S. multinational companies and making exporters' goods less competitive abroad.Its trajectory also influences prices for raw materials like oil, copper and gold, which are denominated in dollars and become more expensive to foreign investors when the dollar rises.Many investors expected the dollar to strengthen in 2017, boosted by the Trump administration's fiscal-stimulus and infrastructure-spending pledges. Instead, the currency as of Friday had fallen nearly 7% against its peers, as key White House initiatives stalled.""There should be some kind of boost to the dollar"" from the tax plan, said Lee Ferridge, head of macrostrategy for North America at State Street Global Markets. ""But I will be using that as a selling opportunity.""Some analysts said such a rally could mark a climax for the dollar's nearly seven-year-long bull market, as monetary policy begins to tighten in other developed economies. Many expect more central banks around the world to start unwinding nearly a decade of postcrisis stimulus measures in 2018, a process already under way in the U.S. As central banks begin normalizing interest-rate levels, the dollar may become less appealing to some investors, who for years had sought U.S. assets because they offered yields that were high compared with other developed economies.Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas and RBC Capital Markets all believe the dollar will start 2018 stronger, according to forecasts released in the last several weeks. Out of those banks, however, only analysts at RBC predict the currency will hold those gains into year-end.There is less agreement among analysts on how much of the more than $1 trillion U.S. companies are estimated to have stashed abroad will be converted into dollars under the new tax law and what part of that amount is already in the U.S. currency. That makes it difficult to gauge how the tax bill will affect the dollar, or what impact the repatriations will have on the economy.A tax-repatriation holiday enacted under the administration of George W. Bush in late 2004 prompted companies to bring in $312 billion, according to the Internal Revenue Service. The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, broke a yearslong downtrend to rise nearly 13% in 2005, a move analysts attributed to cash flowing in the U.S. The S&P 500, which includes many multinationals, rose 3% -- a smaller gain than in either of the two previous years.This time around, repatriations could total between $200 billion and $400 billion, Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates. The firm expects the euro to fall to $1.10 against the dollar in the first quarter of 2018 from around $1.1862 on Friday."
Wells Fargo,Tax Law Not So Big On Jumbo Mortgages," Dec 27, 2017",,1,"Mr. Lele owns shares of U.S. financials such as Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co., which he believes will benefit from stronger growth. He has also increased his dollar holdings to counterbalance assets he owns that are denominated in other currencies and would decline in value if the dollar strengthened.The tax plan is likely to have ramifications for the broader markets as well, some analysts said. Analysts at UBS Wealth Management said the legislation could provide the ""icing on the cake"" for an economy that is already going strong, contributing as much as 8% to corporate profits and a further upside of 5% to the S&P 500.BMO Capital Markets cut its 2018 gold forecast by 1.5% to an average price of $1,280 a troy ounce to account for potential headwinds from a stronger dollar. The metal settled Friday at $1275.40 a troy ounce.The most immediate threat to a dollar rally, however, could come from outside the U.S., where a burgeoning eurozone economy is paving the way for the European Central Bank to unwind its monetary-easing policies and eventually raise rates. That would be a boon for investors who have wanted to diversify their dollar holdings but have stayed out of euros because interest rates in the region are currently near historical lows. The euro was up nearly 13% against the dollar this year as of Friday, and investors expect that rally to continue into 2018.""We are positioned for the dollar to be a little stronger, and then we expect to lighten up on dollars in favor of euros,"" said Nick Gartside, international chief investment officer of fixed income at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. He expects the euro to rise as high as $1.30 against the dollar by the end of 2018.The shift is one that likely spells the end for the dollar's yearslong rally, during which the U.S. currency has appreciated more than 30% against its peers, said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income. The dollar has appreciated more than 30% against its peers from its lows of 2011.""You had a gigantic bull market in the dollar in recent years, but now the tide is turning,"" Mr. Tipp said."
Wells Fargo,WEEKEND INVESTOR --- Mortgage Borrowers Inundate Banks to Prepay Taxes," Dec 30, 2017",,1,"The jumbo-mortgage market has been a bright spot for the banking industry in recent years. The tax law could take some of the shine off it.The tax-code overhaul, among its many other consequences, eliminates some of the benefits of homeownership, particularly for high-end homes. And the borrowers who buy those homes are exactly whom banks have been targeting.""The banks really like jumbo mortgages,"" said Guy Cecala, publisher of the trade publication Inside Mortgage Finance. ""It's a business they've become increasingly reliant on."" Last year, jumbo mortgages hit their highest level since 2006 by dollar volume, according to the publication's estimates.Predicting the tax law's exact effect on the jumbo market is difficult, and most banks aren't talking yet about what they expect. Complicating matters: Wealthy consumers could benefit from other parts of the new tax law. Also, the jumbo market has already slowed down this year, as higher interest rates have crimped refinancing activity.Still, some analysts say the tax changes could further slow the pace of jumbo mortgages, though for now they expect only a modest single-digit percentage dropfrom the law.Since the financial crisis, banks have beenpushing hard on jumbo mortgages, or loans that are too big to be sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In most parts of the country, ajumbois any loan above $424,100. Banks generally keep the loans on their own books, as wealthy borrowers who use the products are less likely to default.There are two main ways the tax law could hinder some of that activity. It slashes the size of loans that qualify for the mortgage-interest deduction from $1 million to $750,000. It also curbs the amount of property taxes homeowners can deduct from their tax bill. Mr. Cecala said this cap could make wealthy buyers reconsider buying a second or third home, since the property-tax deduction is one of the major benefits of doing so.In ""states like New York, New Jersey, California -- that's a big deal,"" said KBW analyst Christopher McGratty. Current mortgages will get to keep the $1 million cap on mortgage-interest deductibility, but that could also slow sales by persuading some high-end homeowners not to move.The banks' increasing production of jumbo mortgages has been notable since they have pulled back on other types of mortgages, tightening lending standards and making way for nonbank lenders to take on riskier customers. Wells Fargo & Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. are the three biggest jumbo mortgage producers.At banks with $10 billion or more in assets, which includes all midsize and large banks, 19% of all mortgage originations were over the typical jumbo limit in 2016, up from 9% in 2006, according to an analysis using software from ComplianceTech's LendingPatterns.com."

Wells Fargo,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Wells Fargo Earns New Ire From Bank's Overseers," Jan 6, 2018",,1,"The assessment -- known as a bank's CAMELS score -- ranks a firm on a variety of measures including capital, management and liquidity. The scores are confidential and can affect the level of insurance payments a bank must make as well as the level of regulatory oversight of a firm.The reduction in the management component of Wells Fargo's CAMELS score, which hasn't been previously reported, reflected concerns about Wells Fargo's management and its ability to manage risk, the people familiar with the decision said.The downgrade occurred as Wells Fargo continued to grapple with issues related to how it treats customers, after the revelation in September 2016 of years of improper sales practices. The methods resulted in potentially 3.5 million accounts opened without customers' knowledge.Elsewhere in the bank, more than 550,000 auto-loan and mortgage customers were potentially overcharged for products for years as well.Regulators' concerns focus on the bank's overall approach to catching and preventing problems that can harm customers.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has been weighing a new enforcement action against the bank related to such risk controls, according to people familiar with the matter. A decision could be made in coming weeks and is likely to result in an enforcement action, these people said. If this happens, Wells Fargo may also be required to pay tens of millions of dollars as part of any settlement, one of these people said.A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment on the bank's CAMELS rating or any potential OCC actions.The spokeswoman said the bank is ""very focused on prudent and effective risk management"" and continues to enhance those matters. She cited the bank's work to centralize risk-management functions for better oversight; create a conduct-management office to protect employees and customers; and build centers of excellence in areas like testing and validation.An OCC spokesman declined to comment on ""supervisory matters pertaining to any specific institution.""The possibility of a regulatory sanction follows months of back and forth between the bank and the OCC over how Wells Fargo assesses risks, according to people familiar with the process. During that time, Wells Fargo has had to bring in an outside consultant to try to revamp its procedures and has had to undo some structural changes made in response to the revelation of the sales-practices scandal in September 2016."
Wells Fargo,Bond Inflation Needle Moves Up," Jan 8, 2018",,1,"A measure of the bond market's expectations for inflation crossed a key threshold in the past week, highlighting investors' renewed economic enthusiasm.The 10-year inflation break-even rate, which reflects the yield premium on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note over the comparable Treasury inflation-protected security, topped 2% on Tuesday for the first time in more than nine months, according to Thomson Reuters. It settled Friday at 2.027%, its highest level since March 16.Two-percent is an important level for the break-even rate because it matches the Federal Reserve's annual target for inflation, which has puzzled economists by remaining soft in recent months despite improvement in other aspects of the economy.The break-even rate hovered around 1.8% in November before gathering momentum as energy prices rose and as Congress moved forward with a plan to cut corporate taxes, which is expected to boost growth around 0.5% in 2018, according to BNP Paribas.With many investors expecting the economy to continue expanding at or near the 3.2% pace it recorded in the third quarter, and with the unemployment rate having held at 4.1% for a third consecutive month in December, investors are increasingly focusing on the potential for prices to rise. One channel they are scrutinizing is wages, which some expect to pick up substantially as the labor market tightens further.The break-even rate has climbed in recent weeks as investors bought Treasury-inflation protected securities, or TIPS, and sold regular Treasurys, a typical strategy when they see a risk of rising inflation. Investors in TIPS receive a small yield as well as an increase to their principal equal to the annual change in the consumer-price index."
Wells Fargo,"Buffett Zeroes In On Likely Successor --- Berkshire promotes bosses of reinsurance, utility units as part of planning for next CEO"," Jan 11, 2018",,1,"During the company's annual meeting last year, Mr. Buffett suggested that whoever ultimately steps into his role will be responsible for spending the company's huge pile of cash and that his successor could take the reins while Mr. Buffett is still alive.Berkshire currently holds more than $100 billion in cash. Mr. Buffett has lamented the difficulty of finding attractive large acquisition targets. A few potential acquisitions fell through in 2017. Kraft Heinz Co. dropped a $143 billion offer, which would have been partly backed by Berkshire, for Unilever PLC. And Texas power-transmission company Oncor terminated a deal with Berkshire's utility arm in favor of a higher offer from Sempra Energy.Mr. Buffett has helmed Berkshire since 1965. Even as the company grew to be one of the largest in the world, it remained highly decentralized, with each operating business run relatively independently. Berkshire employs about 25 people in its headquarters in Omaha, Neb., a number that Mr. Buffett said isn't changing with the new appointments. Mr. Jain works out of Stamford, Conn., and Mr. Abel is based in Des Moines, Iowa.Some parts of the succession plan are well known. Mr. Buffett's oldest son, Howard, is a member of Berkshire's board and set to take on the role of nonexecutive chairman in the future. And Berkshire hired two portfolio managers in recent years, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who are expected to oversee all of Berkshire's equity investments someday.But even with the recent news, Mr. Buffett continues to keep the name of his chosen successor close to the vest. The successor's name could change depending on when Mr. Buffett leaves the company, he suggested.""Our directors know what they would do tomorrow morning if it happened, but they don't know what they would do four years from now, say, if it happened then,"" Mr. Buffett said on CNBC, referring to a change in leadership.Berkshire's class A shares rose 1.3% Wednesday to a new closing high. ""My sense is this is overwhelmingly favorable and approved [by shareholders], partly because it's been anticipated,"" said Lawrence Cunningham, a law professor at George Washington University."
Wells Fargo,Wal-Mart Boosts Wages After Tax Overhaul," Jan 12, 2018",,1,"The higher wage will add about $300 million in annual expenses for Wal-Mart while the bonuses will result in a $400 million hit to the current quarter's profit, the company said. But the payout is just a sliver of what Wal-Mart, which had nearly $500 billion in revenue last year, stands to gain from the tax overhaul.""The $300 million of incremental labor expenses in 2018 only represents about 15% of the potential cash windfall we estimate that [Wal-Mart] could enjoy,"" wrote Ray Young, a retail analyst for Gordon Haskett Research Advisors. He expects the company will dedicate at least as much to lowering prices and use much of the money to boost dividends and buy back stock.Several other large U.S. employers announced plans to raise wages or pay bonuses in the wake of the tax overhaul. The day the legislation was signed by President Donald Trump, AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp. said they would pay a $1,000 bonus to most of their U.S. employees, or more than 300,000 people. Wells Fargo & Co. said it would increase its starting pay to $15 an hour.Mr. McMillon said Thursday that Wal-Mart was still reviewing the impact of the tax law, which lowers the corporate rate to 21% from 35%, but he said it would also earmark funds for training, lower prices and technology investments.

Wells Fargo,Banks Upbeat As Taxes Muddy Earnings," Jan 13, 2018",,1,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. posted fourth-quarter earnings that were roiled by the recent tax overhaul but forecast the changes will bolster future profits and stoke the broader U.S. economy.JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said a $2.4 billion charge related to the tax law caused its profit to fall 37% from a year earlier to $4.23 billion. Even so, Chief Executive James Dimon said the tax law enacted late last year was ""a big, significant positive and much of it will fall to our bottom line in 2018 and beyond.""Other big banks, including Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., have said the tax law will result in billions of dollars in one-time charges when they report fourth-quarter results next week. They, too, have said those hits will give way to substantial long-term gains.That bodes well for banks, coming at a time when the economy is showing strength, unemployment remains low and interest rates are inching higher.""The backdrop is set up well for these banks: higher interest rates, improving GDP growth that has to help loan growth,"" said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Dallas-based Hodges Capital Management, which owns shares of Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Bank of America Corp.At Wells Fargo, the immediate impact of the tax law was a gain due to shrinking tax liabilities, which boosted net income by about $3.35 billion.PNC Financial Services Group Inc., which also reported earnings Friday, similarly cited a tax-related boost to net income due to the declining value of tax liabilities. CEO William Demchak said in an interview it will take time to see how the tax-code changes play out among customers and consumers, or if it spurs more borrowing.But overall, ""for all the investment decisions that companies make, the U.S. just got that much more attractive,"" Mr. Demchak said. ""It's going to win more than it won before in terms of where people choose to do business activity and invest.""David James, director of research for Denver-based James Advantage Funds, said the tax-overhaul impact is ""music to people's ears"" and is hopeful higher profits will lead to increased dividends and buybacks at banks like JPMorgan. He cautioned, though, that investors will soon bake in boosts from the new tax law into banks' expectations.""If this becomes the new normal it may become harder to impress the markets,"" said Mr. James, whose firm's James Balanced: Golden RainbowFund owns about $11.5 million of JPMorgan shares."

Wells Fargo,"Goldman's Trading Falters --- Hit by tax charge and fixed-income falloff, bank reports $1.93 billion quarterly loss"," Jan 18, 2018",,1,"The most recent poor quarter is likely to intensify calls for more dramatic changes, including a shake-up of its broader trading division's leadership. That idea has gained steam among top Goldman executives in recent months, according to people familiar with the discussions.Overall, Goldman's quarterly earnings, like those of other big banks, were muddied by the new tax law. A $4.4 billion one-time charge wiped out the company's entire quarterly profit, producing its first loss since 2011 of $1.93 billion. Without the charge, Goldman's net income would have exceeded analyst expectations.But Goldman disappointed investors by saying it would dial back its stock-buyback plans to plow earnings instead into areas where it thinks it can grow.Those include steadier businesses such as consumer banking and money management.Both gained ground in 2017, helping to boost Goldman's full-year revenue 5%, the best showing among big banks so far. Asset management added $42 billion in long-term money at a time when investors are fleeing actively managed funds, and Goldman's fledgling consumer-lending effort wrote $2 billion in fresh loans. But those efforts will take years to fill the roughly $15 billion revenue hole opened by Goldman's trading woes -- if they ever do.For the lack of noticeable progress in Goldman's trading turnaround, another firmwide effort is bearing fruit. A few years ago, executives decided to make a play for debt-underwriting business. That business historically has been dominated by big commercial banks, which can write large checks and tap trillions of dollars in low-cost deposits to fund them.Debt-underwriting revenue hit a record $2.5 billion for the year and in the fourth quarter surpassed that of JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup. Goldman has made inroads on the back of its merger bankers, who are more often offering debt, in addition to advice, when putting together deals."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Wells's Risk-Management Chief to Retire," Jan 18, 2018",,0,"The downgrade of the assessment, known as a CAMELS score, occurred over the summer of 2017, as Wells Fargo continued to grapple with issues related to how it treats customers. In September 2016, the bank settled allegations that it had years of improper sales practices that resulted in potentially 3.5 million accounts being opened without customers' knowledge.Elsewhere in the bank, more than 550,000 auto-loan and mortgage customers were potentially overcharged for products for years as well. Regulators' most recent concerns focus on the bank's overall approach to catching and preventing problems that can harm customers, a major part of risk management.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has been weighing a new enforcement action against the bank related to such risk controls, the Journal reported earlier this month.A Wells Fargo spokeswoman at the time declined to comment on the bank's CAMELS rating or any potential OCC actions. The spokeswoman then said the bank is ""very focused on prudent and effective risk management"" and continues to enhance those matters.Mr. Loughlin, 62 years old, has been with the bank or its predecessors for 36 years and has been chief risk officer since 2008. He reports directly to Wells Fargo Chief Executive Timothy Sloan and has served on the bank's operating committee of its top executives.Mr. Sloan said in a statement that Mr. Loughlin has served during ""some of the most critical times in our company's history,"" including the financial crisis and the bank's acquisition of Wachovia Corp.Since then, Mr. Loughlin has overseen risk matters related to credit, markets, operations, compliance and cybersecurity, according to the bank.Over the past two years, Mr. Loughlin also led a plan to centralize many of the company's risk functions. But Wells Fargo didn't always specify employees' new roles and responsibilities, current and former executives said. Regulators noticed the problems, and Mr. Loughlin had to submit a new risk framework to them in the first half of 2017, these executives said."
Wells Fargo,Investors Are Banking on Reduced Taxes --- Optimism that lenders' stocks will rise further is fueled by forecasts of lower effective rates," Jan 19, 2018",,1,"Now that big banks have finished reporting fourth-quarter earnings filled with noise from the new tax law, how much do they expect to actually pay in taxes going forward? A lot less than in the past.That is just what investors were hoping to hear. In response, they have kept already buoyant big-bank stocks inching upward.While some firms will pay higher rates than others, a number of big banks indicated they expect their effective tax rates would decline sharply to around 19% or 20% in 2018, as the corporate tax rate gets reduced. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. both said their tax rates would be around that level.That is significant because financial companies have tended to pay taxes at higher rates than big companies in other industries, since so much of their business is centered in the U.S. Furthermore, some of the big banks, such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley, explicitly said they expect lighter tax bills to boost their earnings performance.That is keeping investors optimistic despite some big short-term hits in fourth-quarter earnings that were related to the tax law.Banks took charges as high as $22 billion, at Citigroup Inc., to reduce the value of their deferred-tax assets and account for a one-time tax on foreign earnings. Bank of America's charge was $2.9 billion; Goldman, $4.4 billion. On the other side, Wells Fargo had a gain of $3.35 billion, largely because the tax-rate reduction made its deferred-tax liabilities -- taxes it owed -- less onerous.Investors looked through this noise, though, because it will give way to greater earnings power down the road as the corporate tax rate falls to 21% from 35%.Financial shares surged in the wake of President Donald Trump's election. They foundered in mid-2017, as the new administration's legislative agenda stumbled. But in September, prospects for a tax-code overhaul brightened, and that marked a renewed upward turn for bank stocks.Now that investors have a sense of how much banks' tax bills may fall, they are more confident about their earnings power going forward.Bank of America said it expects its tax rate to be about 20% absent unusual items, compared with an expectation before the tax law was passed of about 29% for 2018. Its effective rate in 2016 was nearly 29%. (Banks said 2017 rates are skewed by one-time gains and losses related to the tax law.)Assuming all of the benefits go to the bottom line, that would mean a boost of more than 1.5 percentage points to Bank of America's return on tangible common equity and more than 0.1 percentage point on its return on average assets, Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said on the bank's earnings call."
Wells Fargo,REVIEW --- Play: News Quiz," Feb 3, 2018",,0,"The harsh rebuke of the third-largest U.S. bank by assets came on the last business day of Janet Yellen's tenure as chairwoman of the Fed. It prompted Wells Fargo's stock to fall more than 6% in after-hours trading on Friday. The bank also said it expected the action to reduce expected 2018 after-tax profit by $300 million to $400 million.The Fed's enforcement action shows the difficulties Wells Fargo faces in overcoming the sales-practices scandal that engulfed it in 2016. That led to a public and political uproar, the abrupt departure of the bank's former chief executive and numerous governmental investigations.The Fed has never before imposed such a broad, companywide growth restriction as part of an enforcement action, Fed officials said. Wells Fargo is barred from growing past the $1.95 trillion in assets it had at the end of 2017. Fed officials did say the company can continue to lend and take deposits.The Fed imposed the penalties after officials concluded Wells Fargo had been growing without proper risk controls in place, the officials said. The Fed has seen some improvement in Wells Fargo's risk management lately, but expects the bank to take further steps, they said.""We cannot tolerate pervasive and persistent misconduct at any bank and the consumers harmed by Wells Fargo expect that robust and comprehensive reforms will be put in place to make certain that the abuses do not occur again,"" Ms. Yellen said in a statement.Wells Fargo said it was ""confident it will satisfy the requirements of the consent order"" that it agreed to with the Fed.""We take this order seriously and are focused on addressing all of the Federal Reserve's concerns,"" said CEO Timothy Sloan, adding that they referred to ""prior issues where we have already made significant progress.""Wells Fargo recently said its chief risk officer will retire in 2018, and it is also bringing in a former New York Fed official to serve as its regulatory officer beginning in March.

Wells Fargo,Wells Fargo's Political Penalty," Feb 7, 2018",,1,"The Dodd-Frank Act gave financial regulators more power and discretion, which some have used as a license to do whatever they want. The latest example is the Federal Reserve's arbitrary and seemingly political punishment of Wells Fargo for retail banking blunders.Janet Yellen on her way out as Federal Reserve Chair on Friday imposed a sweeping consent order on Wells to punish ""recent and widespread consumer abuses and other compliance breakdowns."" To wit, its creation of as many as 3.5 million unauthorized consumer accounts and enrollment of 570,000 auto-loan customers in insurance they didn't want. The Fed is prohibiting the nation's third largest bank from growing its balance sheet until it ""makes sufficient improvements"" in risk management and compliance. Translation: Wells Fargo's board of directors must do whatever the Fed orders.This new penalty comes after the bank made substantial reforms following settlements with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for creating the unauthorized accounts, which resulted from aggressive sales goals and misguided compensation incentives. The bank exploited unknowing customers, but they suffered a total of only $6.1 million in harm -- an average of $1.75 per account. Wells compensated for those losses and paid $185 million in regulatory fines and $142 million to settle a class action.Wells also fired executives and some 5,300 bankers. CEO John Stumpf and board chairman Stephen Sanger retired. The board last year clawed back $69 million in compensation from Mr. Stumpf and $67 million from Carrie Tolstedt, the deposed head of community banking. Wells itself discovered the auto-loan overcharges and notified regulators. And it promised to reimburse customers and removed culpable staff.Notably, the CFPB and OCC missed -- or failed to halt -- Wells's blunders, which took place over several years during the Dodd-Frank era. Isn't rooting out such abuses what Senator Elizabeth Warren designed the CFPB to do? The Los Angeles Times revealed the unauthorized accounts in 2013. An internal OCC review last spring reported that its regulators had received 700 complaints by Wells employees related ""to gaming of incentive plans"" but failed to act until the story went public.The Fed blames the bank's mistakes on corporate governance failures, which is a catchall. But it also acknowledges that Wells has ""taken steps to review its corporate governance and risk management"" and laudably identified errors to regulators. About half of its board has turned over in the past two years, and Wells plans to replace four more members this year.All of which raises the question of why this double jeopardy now? One reason may be political pressure from the likes of Ms. Warren, who has been demanding heads at Wells. Ms. Yellen wrote to Ms. Warren on Friday crowing that the consent order is ""unique and more stringent"" than any that has been imposed for ""similar unsafe and unsound practices."" Ms. Warren was delighted.The new growth restraint has no relation to Wells's transgressions and will hurt the bank's lending as the economy gains speed. Wells says its balance sheet provides flexibility to minimize the impact on customers, but it could also breed distortions within the bank's asset management as bankers look for ways to make up lost earnings. Wells estimates the penalty will reduce earnings by $300 million to $400 million this year, which may not sound like much on $22.2 billion in profits for 2017.But its arbitrary nature should cause shivers in bank boardrooms everywhere, which may have been Ms. Yellen's main point. The Fed hasn't provided a legal justification for its order, which requires Wells to waive ""any issuance of a notice of charges""; judicial review; and the ability to ""challenge or contest, in any manner, the basis, issuance, validity, terms, effectiveness, or enforceability.""The irony is that Wells didn't need the 2008 bank bailout because of its conservative asset management. Its decentralized decision-making, which regulators now claim contributed to the errors, was at the time considered a strength because risk was spread across business units"
Wells Fargo,"Dow Swings 500 Points, Closes Lower --- Interest-rate worries, drop in oil prices continue to weigh on major stock indexes"," Feb 8, 2018",,1,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average swung in a range of more than 500 points before closing slightly lower, extending a string of volatility as investors assess how the potential for higher interest rates would affect the nearly nine-year bull market.The blue-chip index has moved wildly this week, trading in its two biggest intraday ranges in history on Monday and Tuesday when the index swung 1,596.65 and 1,167.49 points, respectively.A recent rise in bond yields has stoked fears that a pickup in inflation could lead central banks to tighten monetary policy more quickly than expected, making stocks less attractive as interest rates rise. Those concerns helped push stocks sharply lower Friday and Monday when the Dow suffered its biggest one-session point decline on record. Tuesday's uneven session -- with 29 changes of direction for the Dow -- ended with sizable gains.Some investors said the declines were overdue and created a buying opportunity given favorable earnings growth that they think should help stocks continue marching higher. Still, others warn that technical selling drove the recent pullback rather than investors panicking, which might suggest more dips lie ahead.""We're just now digesting what's been a pretty violent reaction,"" said Jamie Robertson, senior portfolio manager of global asset allocation at Manulife Asset Management, which reduced stock positions recently but is now discussing increasing them. ""This is the type of market action you get once you've had a bit of a dust storm.""After spending most of Wednesday's session in positive territory and rising as much as 381 points, the Dow industrials turned lower toward the end of the day and closed down 19.42 points, or 0.1%, at 24893.35. The S&P 500 declined 13.48 points, or 0.5%, to 2681.66, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 63.90 points, or 0.9%, to 7051.98.A drop in oil prices continued to weigh on major indexes after data showed U.S. production surged to a record last week. The S&P 500 energy sector fell 1.7%, bringing its losses in the past week to 8.2%. It has been the broader index's worst performer during that span.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.843% from 2.766% Tuesday. Yields rise as bond prices fall and were back near their four-year high hit last Friday.Some traders have said investors are adjusting to a new market backdrop following a historically calm period in the stock market and one of the best-ever starts to a year for global indexes.The Dow industrials are down more than 5% from their Jan. 26 record but still up 0.7% on the year.""I wouldn't say it's over yet,"" said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank. ""It wouldn't be surprising if we got a full 10% correction.""The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, known as the ""fear gauge"" for the U.S. stock market, fell after briefly hitting its highest intraday level since 2009 on Tuesday.Danna Pratte, owner of a nutritional supplements company in Phoenix, said she has been worried in recent days about some of the stocks she owns. But despite rising anxiety over recent market swings, Ms. Pratte, 45 years old, said she hasn't made any changes to her portfolio."
Wells Fargo,Wells Errs In Effort To Make Amends," Feb 12, 2018",,0,"Wells Fargo & Co. is having trouble doing right by the customers it has wronged.The big bank acknowledged that it recently sent out 38,000 erroneous communications to customers that it forced to buy unneeded auto insurance.In some cases, according to two people briefed on the matter, Wells Fargo has also sent refunds to people who weren't the bank's customers; notified those who were harmed of incorrect amounts to be paid; and told people of coming refunds though they had never gotten the insurance.In another matter, Wells Fargo has yet to begin a broad-based reach-out related to refunds for as many as 110,000 customers who were charged improper fees to extend interest-rate commitments they received from Wells Fargo on their mortgages, people familiar with the matter said.Wells Fargo will soon require mortgage customers to agree to a refund through the mail before sending them money and estimates half or fewer will do so, the people said.Catherine Pulley, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said in a statement: ""We are focused on making things right for our customers and ensuring this large-scale remediation happens correctly and as quickly as possible.""She said a Wells Fargo vendor working on the auto-insurance matter caught a coding mistake that resulted in 38,000 customers receiving a letter they didn't need with no checks included. Wells Fargo is working with the vendor ""to ensure these customers receive the appropriate communication -- including any refunds they're eligible for,"" she said. Ms. Pulley added that the bank is currently aware of one noncustomer having received a check.The problem mailings and refund delays are happening as the bank continues to grapple with regulatory scrutiny following its sales-practices misconduct.For those actions and others, the Fed earlier this month took the unprecedented action of restricting the bank's growth until ""it sufficiently improves its governance and controls.""That punishment followed a rebuke issued to Wells Fargo last fall by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Citing repeated deficiencies, the regulator warned the bank that it would likely face enforcement proceedings because of them.The OCC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, another regulator, are aware of the refund delays with mortgage customers and have been pressing the bank about them, a person familiar with the matter said. The regulators have also been involved with auto-lending refunds, approving different phases of the mailings.A spokesman for the OCC declined to comment. The CFPB declined to comment.Last summer, the bank said it had forced nearly 600,000 customers who financed their car purchases with Wells Fargo to pay for collision coverage they didn't need. The practices pushed 274,000 customers, among them active military service members, into delinquency on their auto loans, according to an internal report commissioned by the bank, and resulted in 20,000 wrongful car repossessions."
Wells Fargo,No Sympathy for Wells Fargo," Feb 13, 2018",,0,"Wells Fargo & Co. said it plans to make refunds to certain auto-loan customers who may have been improperly charged for some auto insurance. The bank late Thursday said it found 570,000 customers who may have been affected from policies placed between 2012 and 2017, and that they will get refunds or account adjustments totaling around $80 million. Franklin Codel, head of Wells Fargo consumer lending, said the bank takes responsibility for its failure to manage the insurance program and apologized to customers. ""Upon our discovery, we acted swiftly to discontinue the program and immediately develop a plan to make impacted customers whole,"" he said. Asked about Wells Fargo's auto-insurance practices, a spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said he couldn't comment on ongoing supervisory issues or pending actions. The bank's auto-loan problems come on the heels of Wells Fargo's sales-practices scandal last year, in which bank employees opened as many as 2.1 million accounts using fictitious or unauthorized customer information. Wells Fargo paid a $185 million fine in September 2016, its chief executive abruptly retired, and it has continued facing many federal and state investigations since then. The bank has said it is cooperating with those. Wells Fargo agreed to a $142 million class-action customer settlement along with related customer refunds. Regarding the auto loans, Wells Fargo said customers' contracts require them to maintain collateral-protection insurance on behalf of the lender throughout the term of the loan. Wells Fargo purchased that insurance, known as CPI, from a vendor on a customer's behalf if there was no evidence the customer already had the insurance, the bank said. That insurance protects against the loss or damage to a vehicle serving as collateral to secure a loan. The vendor is National General Insurance, a company the bank had joined with for years, a person familiar with the matter said.A spokeswoman for National General, Christine Worley, said it ""feels confident with its compliance in this highly regulated industry."" She added: ""We have always refunded premiums directly to our financial institution customers in a timely manner and provided all necessary notifications in compliance with law and industry practice.""Wells Fargo said that, in response to customer complaints in July 2016, it began a review of the program and third-party vendor practices. Based on that review, it discontinued the program in September 2016.The New York Times earlier reported the problems with Wells Fargo's auto insurance, citing a report from consultant Oliver Wyman prepared for the bank examining National General insurance policies sold to Wells Fargo customers from January 2012 through July 2016. It found the insurance was often more expensive than auto-insurance customers had already obtained on their own.Wells Fargo said it has ""gone through a comprehensive review using independent consultants"" that determined certain external vendor processes and internal controls were inadequate.For instance, one result was that customers may have been charged premiums for this insurance even if they were paying for their own vehicle insurance. In some cases, those premiums could have contributed to a default that led to the vehicle's repossession.The bank has begun providing refunds to some customers and will send letters and refund checks to additional customers in August. The bank said it expects to complete the refunding process by year-end."
Wells Fargo,Market Turmoil Hits Funds Linked to Volatility," Feb 13, 2018",,0,"A federal investigation into sales practices at Wells Fargo & Co. now includes the bank's wealth-management business, extending the probe beyond the firm's retail-banking unit where the problems originated, people familiar with the matter said.The Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are conducting the investigation into the wealth-management business, these people said. Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation have been interviewing some wealth-management employees in the Phoenix area as recently as this week, some of these people said.Wells Fargo declined to comment. Officials at the Justice Department and SEC also declined to comment.Several U.S. attorney's offices, as well as a bevy of federal and state regulators, have been investigating Wells Fargo since the fall of 2016 when the bank disclosed widespread sales-practices problems. Those included bank employees opening as many as 3.5 million accounts without customers' knowledge or authorization. Wells Fargo has said it is cooperating with the investigations.Arizona was one epicenter of Wells Fargo's retail-banking problems. Some employees in that region created fake email addresses using customers' phone numbers to open banking accounts or opened two accounts for each customer, a practice known as a ""double pack."" Some top executives from that region have since been fired by the bank.Prosecutors' and regulators' inquiries have largely centered on Wells Fargo's retail-banking business, one of the largest in the U.S. by deposits. Late last year, though, the Justice Department told the bank to conduct an independent investigation into its wealth-management business after it received reports of problems there from whistleblowers, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.The investigation by the Justice Department and SEC is separate from the bank's own inquiry, one of the people familiar with the matter said. The bank now faces state and federal investigations into its practices in auto-lending, mortgages, wealth and investment management and foreign exchangeThe widening of the sales-practices investigation has occurred despite Wells Fargo's attempts to put the problems behind it by restructuring different businesses, firing executives and refunding customers. Wells Fargo also has faced regulatory censure for failing to address risk-management issues that led to improper customer charges in its auto-lending and mortgage businesses.In early February, the Federal Reserve sanctioned Wells Fargo for failing to put proper risk controls in place, barring the bank from growing past the $1.95 trillion in assets it had at the end of 2017. The Fed cited ""widespread consumer abuses"" in its unprecedented rebuke.Earlier this month, Wells Fargo disclosed in a securities filing its independent review into the wealth-management business. At the time, the bank said it is assessing ""whether there have been inappropriate referrals or recommendations, including with respect to rollovers for 401(k) plan participants, certain alternative investments, or referrals of brokerage customers to the company's investment and fiduciary services business.""The bank's filing also disclosed that it is reviewing fee calculations within certain fiduciary and custody accounts. The bank has found instances of incorrect fees applied to certain assets and accounts that resulted in overcharging customers, according to the filing."
Wells Fargo,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Wells Fargo CEO Says Fed Move Won't Harm It," Feb 14, 2018",,1,"Wells Fargo & Co. Chief Executive Timothy Sloan worked to reassure investors that the Federal Reserve's unprecedented action capping its assets this month won't hurt the bank.The move by the Fed, which also said the San Francisco-based lender would replace four directors in 2018, is unlikely to affect the bank's annual filing with the Fed for the ""stress test,"" a review of the bank's financial health that has become an important postcrisis ritual for banks looking to approve larger dividends and share buybacks.Speaking at an investor conference Tuesday, Mr. Sloan said the moves by the Fed and the bank's response are unlikely to affect its stress-test submission ""positively or negatively.""Mr. Sloan also said there ""haven't been any major changes"" to the bank since the Fed announced its enforcement action on Feb. 2 and Wells Fargo gave some updates on a hastily arranged conference call later that day.""We have plans to address the Fed's concerns,"" said Mr. Sloan on Tuesday, adding that the bank ""will meet the deadlines"" the Fed has set.Investors are focusing on those deadlines to monitor when the bank can begin expanding its assets more freely again.Each morning, Mr. Sloan said he checks metrics like loan, liquidity and deposits.""It's pointing to a slow but steady recovery,"" he said. ""It's never as fast as I would like, but it's absolutely occurring.""On the stress test, he said even though the Fed's assumptions are more conservative, the underlying credit quality shouldn't affect the bank's balance sheet. He added that he and Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry have been clear that Wells Fargo's goal over the next two to three years is to get its capital levels down to about 10%, an amount that should provide cushion above the regulatory minimum.""That's absolutely doable and that's what our plan is,"" he said. Still, banks are often concerned they may fail the qualitative portion of the test.Mr. Sloan said the bank's asset cap has had a nonexistent customer impact. Mr. Sloan was responding to a question about customers, in which he detailed the bank's focus on reiterating that it is open for business.He added that wholesale customers, who are likely to be most affected by the asset cap, have a sticky relationship with the bank if they use it for services like treasury management.The Fed imposed an asset cap that Wells Fargo has said affects its earnings by $300 million to $400 million. Mr. Sloan said there hasn't been any change in estimates so far.""We wanted to provide as much clarity as possible, how we were thinking about operating within the asset cap,"" he said. ""None of that has changed."""

Wells Fargo,Prices Rise as Economy Heats Up," Feb 15, 2018",,0,"But their performance diverged from there, marking the strongest evidence yet that the two big consumer lenders have changed places, with Bank of America emerging as a budding investor darling and Wells Fargo taking the role of problem child following a series of missteps.Wells Fargo said Friday that third-quarter profit tumbled 19% from a year ago, due to continued fallout from its sales-practice scandal and fresh legal issues. The San Francisco-based bank said revenue also fell from a year earlier, while its loan portfolio shrank for a third consecutive quarter. Wells Fargo continued to struggle with higher expenses in the wake of the scandal and a newly disclosed $1 billion litigation charge tied to investigations into crisis-era mortgage-market practices.Wells Fargo's shares fell 2.8% to $53.69 on Friday.Bank of America, on the other hand, is putting once-intractable problems behind it. The lender reported its highest quarterly profit in six years. The bank's revenue rose, as it did at peers J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. earlier in the week. Even a decline in Bank of America's trading revenue didn't dent overall results much, as gains in interest income and continued cost-cutting helped offset the weakness. Its shares gained 1.5% to $25.83.Wells Fargo, a former investor favorite that once surpassed J.P. Morgan as the most valuable U.S. bank by market capitalization, has slipped behind Bank of America to the No. 3 ranking on this basis.While Wells Fargo by some measures remains the more profitable bank, the two lenders' revenues are now about equal, with Wells Fargo's roughly $87 million advantage down from nearly $900 million in the second quarter of 2016 before the sales problems emerged.Led by Chief Executive Timothy Sloan, Wells Fargo reported that net income during the quarter slipped below $5 billion for the first timein five years, due in large part to the $1 billion it accrued for a previously disclosed mortgage probeover residential mortgage-backed securities. The bank is likely to settle with the Justice Department in coming months, finance chief John Shrewsberry said in an interview.While Wells Fargo suffered a rough quarter, shareholder Hank Smith said he is optimistic about the banking sector overall. That, he said, is because of economic growth, slowly rising interest rates and the expectation of less onerous regulations under the Trump administration.""While the quarter was disappointing, it wasn't a dramatic disappointment,"" said Mr. Smith, co-chief investment officer of Haverford Trust Co., which owns 2.7 million Wells Fargo shares.The biggest reason for the shifting fortunes of the two banks is the declining number of regulatory issues at Bank of America and the increasing tally at Wells Fargo.As recently as 2014, Bank of America's results were dogged by tens of billions of dollars in penalties over financial-crisis-era issues. Since then, the company's legal problems have eased and it has made a concerted effort to cut costs and focus on safer businesses such as lending to consumers with good credit.Wells Fargo didn't face as many regulatory fines until cross-selling abuses by branch stafferuptedin September 2016,with employees creating potentially3.5 million fake accounts.The bank fired 5,300 employees over five years related to the sales problems.Two months after the bank settled that case, Donald Trump's election as president raised the prospect of faster economic growth and higher interest rates, a combination that brightened the prospects for many banks, but especially Bank of America given its large mortgage-securities portfolio.The result is that Bank of America shares have soaredmore than 63% over the past year. That move is the biggest gain among the six big U.S. banks, four of which reported earnings this past week.The last two, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., are slated to report resultsTuesday.Wells Fargo posted the worst performance over the period, with a 20% gain.Bank of America received an additional boost whenWarren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the largest shareholder at both lenders, discussed the banks in a late-August television interview.He said both were ""terrific"" but that Wells Fargo likely had more troubles ahead. ""What you find is there's never just one cockroach in the kitchen,"" he said.He has praised CEO Brian Moynihan's leadership and said he plans to be a Bank of America shareholder for a long time.Bank of America's third-quarter profit rose because the bank continued to cut costs and got a lift in lending profits from higher interest rates. The results put the bank close to its long-held profitability goals.Meanwhile, costs at Wells Fargo jumped 8%, to $14.35 billion, and Mr. Sloan said they are likely to remain heightened through year-end 2018. The bank also raised the target for its efficiency ratio because of lower-than-expected asset growth and higher-than-expected expenses.The $1 billion litigation charge at Wells Fargo also cut into its community-banking unit results."

Wells Fargo,Big Bank CEOs Reap Rich Pay Packages," Feb 17, 2018",,1,"Wall Street CEOs are getting paid the big bucks again.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. said Friday that they gave their CEOs raises for 2017, meaning all five large U.S. banks with significant trading and investment-banking operations have done so.The chief executives of the banks, which include JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley, were paid on average $25.3 million for their work last year, up 17% from 2016, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.For the group as a whole, combined total compensation of about $126 million is the highest annual tally since before the financial crisis.The gains mark the fifth consecutive year in which pay rose for Wall Street's top CEOs. In 2017, the increases reflected stronger profits for banks driven by an expanding economy, rising employment, loosening regulations under President Donald Trump and an improving interest-rate backdrop for lending.Citigroup was the latest to report that it was increasing the boss's compensation. CEO Michael Corbat was paid $23 million for his work in 2017, up 48% from his $15.5 million payday in 2016.Goldman Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein was awarded a $24 million pay package, up 9% from the prior year.Most of the annual compensation announced over the past month at the nation's largest banks comes in the form of incentive bonuses, often stock-based and not cashed until later. And all the pay packages still pale in comparison to Mr. Blankfein's $68.5 million award for 2007 when trading profits and risk-taking drove results for Goldman and its peers.Still, this bonus season for Wall Street CEOs is in many ways the best in more than a decade. All five CEOs were awarded at least $20 million, something that hasn't happened since 2006, according to a Wall Street Journal review of banks' proxy statements. Mr. Corbat, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan and Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman each enjoyed their best annual pay packages as chief executive.Mr. Blankfein received a cash salary of $2 million -- steady from 2016, when he got a pay cut -- plus a cash bonus of $4.4 million and the remainder in stock units whose value will depend on how Goldman does over the next few years, accordingto a regulatory filing Friday.That puts him in the middle of the pack among Wall Street chiefs. JPMorgan Chase's James Dimon got a 5% raise to $29.5 million. Mr. Gorman followed at $27 million after a 20% pay raise. Wells Fargo & Co., which doesn't have a large Wall Street presence, hasn't yet disclosed its CEO's compensation.Goldman's revenue in 2017 rose 5%. Setting aside the impact of a hit from the recently passed tax-overhaul law, its return on equity was 10.8%, one of only two banks to crack double digits.Yet its core business of fixed-income trading had its worst year since the financial crisis. The firm bet wrong on things including interest rates, the U.S. dollar and natural gas. Mr. Blankfein once ran that business and remains closely associated with its performance.The biggest jump in pay came for Mr. Corbat, the lone Wall Street CEO of the five who isn't also the bank's chairman. Citigroup posted a loss of $6.2 billion for 2017, though that was because of a charge the bank took to prepare for the new tax law. The board said it had considered Citigroup's underlying results, as well as the bank's increased shareholder dividends and its passing grade on the Federal Reserve's stress test.It has been a long road for Mr. Corbat to crack the $20 million pay mark. For his first full year as CEO, 2013, he was awarded $14.5 million. The following three years, his pay wavered between $13 million and $16.5 million, as Citigroup struggled to increase profitability and break out of past regulatory problems.For his work in 2017, Mr. Corbat is getting a cash bonus of $6.45 million, to go along with his $1.5 million salary. The rest of the package comprises stock that is dependent on the bank's performance. This is also deferred, meaning it will be paid out over coming years. That structure is meant to tie Mr. Corbat's compensation to the bank's longer-term performance.Last year, Citigroup's board cut his pay because of ""the firm's performance relative to its financial targets.""

Wells Fargo,A Danger Lurks in These Lenders," Feb 21, 2018",,1,"Almost by definition, ordinary investors have few ways to play in the private investing world. One avenue does exist: so-called business-development companies. But wariness is warranted.If the private-capital world consists of funds making illiquid, long-term investments out of view of public markets, business-development companies are a kind of hybrid. They raise equity in public markets, borrow more cash, then make loans and take stakes in small and midsize companies that often are deemed too risky by banks.The companies frequently provide financing for private-equity deals, and some are run by major private-equity firms. The attraction for investors is a high dividend yield. But delivering that has gotten harder because there is a huge supply of funds chasing limited opportunities. Competition with other private lenders and bank-originated leveraged loans has driven business-development companies to accept lower rates, higher leverage on the part of borrowers and weak covenants, says Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Ryan Lynch.The big difference between private lenders and publicly traded business-development companies is that investors can weigh in on the shares. Lately they have been pessimistic, sending the Wells Fargo Business Development Company Index, which tracks 42 companies, down by 16% over the past year.The big worry seems to be a turn in the default cycle. After peaking in 2016 during the energy-market crunch, default rates have fallen, though credit problems are showing up at funds that specialize in so-called lower-middle-market companies with annual adjusted earnings of around $20 million or less.The decline in business-development company shares over the past year shows investors have started to price in some of this risk. At current prices, investors might be tempted by the high yields on offer. The Wells Fargo Business Development Company Index currently yields 10.1%. But credit losses could well keep creeping up. Interest rates are on the rise, and indebted companies can no longer deduct as much of the payments from their U.S. taxes. If the economy loses steam and the credit cycle turns, these types of funds, less diversified than banks and more exposed to riskier companies, will likely feel more pain sooner.And on another valuation metric, the shares are still hardly bargains: Business-development companies are trading at an average of around 0.9 times book value, according to KBW, compared with an average of around 1 times book value over the past five years."
Wells Fargo,Prices of Treasurys Advance," Feb 24, 2018",,0,"Government-bond prices strengthened Friday, capping off a turbulent week.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note slipped for the second straight day to 2.871% from 2.917% Thursday. Yields fall as bond prices rise.The yield on the 10-year note hit a multiyear high earlier in the week before receding. Higher domestic yields alongside improvement in some European bonds may have led investors to buy U.S. government debt later in the week, analysts said.""People are taking advantage of the higher yields that we haven't seen up here in"" several years, said Brian Rehling, co-head of global fixed-income strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.Investors also will be watching for more clues on interest-rate policy at Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's congressional testimony in the coming week.Recent interest-rate volatility has spurred swings across asset classes, analysts say. The Fed released minutes from a January meeting this past week, triggering swings in both stocks and bonds.The Treasury market could be tested again in coming weeks, Mr. Rehling said.Treasury yields have risen in February as solid economic and inflation data have led investors to sell government bonds. Inflation is a primary threat to Treasurys because it weakens the purchasing power of their fixed payments.Fed officials signaled growing confidence in the U.S. economy when they met in January. They supported the Fed's current rate path and could be a precursor to a more aggressive plan.Investors also have built up a large amount of bearish bets on Treasury futures, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Investors can tap Treasury futures to make directional bets or hedge other parts of their portfolios.""Extreme positions can be vulnerable to a rapid unwind, which in this case could aggravate a rate rally,"" wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts in a Feb. 23 note."

Money managers say the penalties these investors faced from their brokers for trading on margin helped deepen the rout.Joe Diaz, a trader who lives in Yuma, Ariz., watched as his portfolio fell as much as $25,000 in early February, forcing him to add more money into his account to satisfy a margin call as the stocks he bought using margin, such as Wells Fargo & Co., Nvidia Corp. and Intel Corp., tumbled alongside the broader indexes.Using a margin loan, an investor like Mr. Diaz would pledge all or part of a portfolio of stocks and bonds as collateral to buy other securities. If the value of the collateral shrinks enough, which tends to depend on the mix of investments that are pledged, the bank can demand repayment. If the margin call isn't met, the securities backing the loan are sold, and the borrower is responsible for any remaining balance.So-called net margin debt was worth 1.31% of the total value of the New York Stock Exchange last year, according to Goldman Sachs data stretching back to 1980, eclipsing the previous peak of 1.27% reached in the buildup to the tech bubble in 2000.""I was so bullish that I went all in,"" said Mr. Diaz. Confident that markets would recover, he deposited $2,500 into his account to satisfy a margin call on Feb. 8. ""The next day, the market ripped higher and I breathed a sigh of relief,"" he said.This month's pullback erased the gains major stock indexes accrued in January, but the Dow and S&P 500 sit on double-digit returns from the two previous years, which kept many investors' portfolios flush through the correction.Some are still rethinking their use of margin loans, which can amplify gains and losses, because they fear jittery markets are here to stay as central banks around the world begin to withdraw stimulus and global interest rates move higher."
Wells Fargo,Global Growth Fuels Commodities Rally," Feb 27, 2018",,1,"A major commodities index posted its 10th straight session of gains on Monday, another sign that investors have shrugged off recent market volatility and are diving back into risky assets.The S&P GSCI Index, which tracks the prices of 24 commodities, has been moving in tandem with global stock markets since last summer as money managers look to capitalize on accelerating global economic growth. The index has risen 5.9% from its Feb. 9 low, with some of the most actively traded raw materials such as oil and copper rebounding following drops alongside stocks earlier this month.Those and other commodities benefit from stronger economic growth because they serve as building blocks for everything from houses and office buildings to automobiles and smartphones. Higher levels of industrial activity, low unemployment and bustling shipping routes tend to buoy demand for petroleum and other raw materials, further supporting commodities prices.With the global economy projected by the International Monetary Fund to grow at its fastest pace since 2011 this year and next year, some investors think a commodities rally that began last summer will continue. As is the case with stocks, some analysts think the fundamentals for investing in raw materials outweigh possible concerns about higher interest rates.""This is one of the strongest macro backdrops I've seen for investing,"" said Mike Mullaney, director of global market research for fund manager Boston Partners, whose firm has increased positions in energy and materials stocks. ""That lends itself to overweighting some of these commodity-based sectors.""Unlike stocks, commodities are still relatively cheap. Oil is still off 56% from its 2008 highs, while gold and copper are off 30% and 31%, respectively, from their records set in 2011.In recent months, stocks around the world and raw materials have traded together, and the recent bounce back for commodities has come as the S&P 500 has recovered 68% of the losses that sent it into correction territory on Feb. 8.That makes the rally look vulnerable to investors' appetite for risk and the direction of the stock market, some analysts say.Some analysts think that riskier investments are likely to weaken as central banks around the world unwind years of accommodative monetary policy. Higher interest rates can make commodities less attractive compared with yield-bearing assets such as Treasurys because raw materials pay their holders nothing. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note has risen to four-year highs and is approaching 3%. It closed at 2.862% MondayOthers think an economic slowdown in China, the world's largest materials consumer, and supply factors continue to loom over the market.John LaForge, head of real asset strategy for the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he thinks commodities have been too dependent on temporary factors -- such as protests in Iran and labor strikes at mines in Chile and Peru -- that have pinched output. Commodities prices are still way off their peaks, and even with recently rising prices, he doesn't expect that trend to reverse.""There's still just too much supply,"" Mr. LaForge said.Other analysts said signs that inflation is picking up should favor commodities. Many investors use raw materials to protect against a surge in consumer prices because they think commodities can hold their value better than other assets. Price increases in commodities also typically contribute to higher inflation as it becomes more expensive for companies to produce goods.Several large companies, including Ford Motor Co. and Procter & Gamble Co., have already blamed weaker profits or darker outlooks on higher commodities prices. Although persistently low inflation has puzzled economists for years, recent U.S. employment data showed wages notching their biggest increase since 2009.Doug Cohen, managing partner of portfolio management at Athena Capital Advisors, said the firm has increased its clients' positions in gold and Treasury-inflation protected securities.""I actually do think this time it's real,"" he said of inflation rising.Fresh money has been pouring back into commodities funds world-wide: Assets under management reached roughly $530 billion in January, up 13% from the previous month and their highest level in four years, Citigroup estimates show. A JPMorgan Chase analysis showed the largest January inflow of open interest into commodities over the past decade.""The environment for investing in commodities is the best since 2004-2008,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note to clients earlier this month."
Wells Fargo,Frontier Halts Payout And Stock Drops 24%," Mar 1, 2018",,1,"A federal investigation into sales practices at Wells Fargo & Co. now includes the bank's wealth-management business, extending the probe beyond the firm's retail-banking unit where the problems originated, people familiar with the matter said.The Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are conducting the investigation into the wealth-management business, these people said. Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation have been interviewing some wealth-management employees in the Phoenix area as recently as this week, some of these people said.Wells Fargo declined to comment. Officials at the Justice Department and SEC also declined to comment.Several U.S. attorney's offices, as well as a bevy of federal and state regulators, have been investigating Wells Fargo since the fall of 2016 when the bank disclosed widespread sales-practices problems. Those included bank employees opening as many as 3.5 million accounts without customers' knowledge or authorization. Wells Fargo has said it is cooperating with the investigations.Arizona was one epicenter of Wells Fargo's retail-banking problems. Some employees in that region created fake email addresses using customers' phone numbers to open banking accounts or opened two accounts for each customer, a practice known as a ""double pack."" Some top executives from that region have since been fired by the bank.Prosecutors' and regulators' inquiries have largely centered on Wells Fargo's retail-banking business, one of the largest in the U.S. by deposits. Late last year, though, the Justice Department told the bank to conduct an independent investigation into its wealth-management business after it received reports of problems there from whistleblowers, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.The investigation by the Justice Department and SEC is separate from the bank's own inquiry, one of the people familiar with the matter said. The bank now faces state and federal investigations into its practices in auto-lending, mortgages, wealth and investment management and foreign exchangeThe widening of the sales-practices investigation has occurred despite Wells Fargo's attempts to put the problems behind it by restructuring different businesses, firing executives and refunding customers. Wells Fargo also has faced regulatory censure for failing to address risk-management issues that led to improper customer charges in its auto-lending and mortgage businesses.In early February, the Federal Reserve sanctioned Wells Fargo for failing to put proper risk controls in place, barring the bank from growing past the $1.95 trillion in assets it had at the end of 2017. The Fed cited ""widespread consumer abuses"" in its unprecedented rebuke.Earlier this month, Wells Fargo disclosed in a securities filing its independent review into the wealth-management business. At the time, the bank said it is assessing ""whether there have been inappropriate referrals or recommendations, including with respect to rollovers for 401(k) plan participants, certain alternative investments, or referrals of brokerage customers to the company's investment and fiduciary services business.""The bank's filing also disclosed that it is reviewing fee calculations within certain fiduciary and custody accounts. The bank has found instances of incorrect fees applied to certain assets and accounts that resulted in overcharging customers, according to the filing."
