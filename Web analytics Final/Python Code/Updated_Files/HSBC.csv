HSBC,"The Analyst Who Predicts Bond Yields Will Hit New Lows; It almost has become an annual rite for analysts to finish the year forecasting the end of the bull run for U.S. government bonds, but one stands away from the pack"," Jan 2, 2017",0,"
It almost has become an annual rite to finish the year forecasting the end of the bull run for U.S. government bonds. Steven Major, global head of fixed-income research at HSBC Holdings PLC, has consistently separated himself from the crowd in recent years by predicting lower Treasury yields.
Having been proved right in the past, the London-based analyst is sticking to his position.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, has climbed to 2.446% from its record low of 1.366% in July, driven in large part by expectations of faster growth and inflationary fiscal policies under a Donald Trump presidency.
Mr. Major, though, is still calling for a 10-year yield of 1.35% by the end of 2017. Among his bets, he is wagering that higher yields in the short term could hurt the economy and that a major stimulus package won't materialize.
The following is a condensed and edited version of a telephone interview with Mr. Major conducted by The Wall Street Journal on Dec. 20.
WSJ: A 10-year yield of 1.35% is a pretty bold bet at this point. How are you feeling about it?
Mr. Major: It's a forecast, isn't it, so it's not wrong or right until you get to the date. I've been here before a few times.

Experience says to me that things happen--stuff happens. At some stage financial conditions will start to influence people's expectations. If rates go up [1 percentage point], as they have, that will affect planning and it will affect the way people consume and invest.
There is a lot of debt in the system and therefore the decisions are going to be much more sensitive than in the past.
WSJ: So higher rates lead to lower rates?
Mr. Major: Yes. The Fed's own model that uses long rates would say that, everything else being equal, the current increase in long rates would reduce future growth forecasts. It's very difficult to forecast what everything would say if you combined it, but I think people are missing that tightening financial conditions will matter.
WSJ: People keep expecting yields to go up. You've been among the most prominent people saying you don't quite see it yet.
Mr. Major: I think many people have been guilty of only looking at the U.S. in a closed-economy way. What has helped inform our opinion is taking it more global. When you ask me about last year's forecast and the year before and the year before that, they all would have included some reference to where we saw the [German] bund and [Japanese government bond] yields.
I'm pretty sure for 2017 we'll still see very low bund and JGB yields. The Bank of Japan is effectively running a cap on the 10-year yield and that cap may be around zero still in a year's time.
Think about emerging markets. Think about China. In the last few years, China has on at least two occasions actually influenced the Fed's decision on the fed-funds rate.
WSJ: That gets us to Donald Trump. Can you give your take on what the market is expecting and what you're expecting?
Mr. Major: The market seems to be pricing in a lot of positive news, and we don't have a great deal of evidence to base that on. It's more hope, I think, than anything else.
When you're already starting from a heavily indebted position, historical comparisons are hard to come by, but I suspect the impact of whatever fiscal loosening we have is going to [have a smaller impact.]
There's a reason we've been stuck with very low natural rates for so long, and that's related to very, very long-term, deep structural factors: demographics, excess of debt, productivity, wealth inequality, these type of things.
WSJ: You're also skeptical that Mr. Trump will be able to push through a large fiscal stimulus.
Mr. Major: Last time I looked, the Republican Party hadn't suddenly become Keynesian. We've got people who are fiscal hawks and they're going to look at spending cuts pretty aggressively. That's not going to be very pleasant.
WSJ: If you could make your best bear case for Treasurys, what would it be?
Mr. Major: If you had very clear evidence in the data that productivity was picking up--and that could come--and
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 2 of 1177

you had continuing strength in wages, a Fed that decides that it's going to move like in 1994, whereby they were moving every other meeting just about, that would be pretty bearish.
WSJ: How high do you think the 10-year Treasury yield could get?
Mr. Major: I doubt you'll get to 3%. I can't imagine the forwards getting much above 4% to 4.5%. That takes you back to the post-taper period in 2013. That was a level that was above the longer-term nominal GDP and therefore was something that I took as a signal that we were in severely restrictive financial conditions.
Today I should imagine that you wouldn't need to get the forward rate anywhere near to 4.5% to generate the same kind of downward pressure on future growth forecasts."

Fire on Ferry Kills At Least 23 People
A search resumed for 17 people reported missing after a ferry fire off the coast of Indonesia's capital that left at least 23 dead, officials said.
The victims died on Sunday when the vessel, Zahro Express, carrying more than 260 people to Tidung, a resort island in the Kepulauan Seribu chain, from a port near Jakarta caught fire, officials said. Most of the passengers were Indonesians celebrating the New Year holiday, local media reported.
Denny Wahyu Haryanto, head of the Jakarta Disaster Mitigation Agency, said he didn't rule out that those reported missing could be among the bodies found inside the ship.

He said that of the 224 passengers who were rescued, 19 were still being treated at hospitals.
Seply Madreta, an official from the Jakarta Disaster Mitigation Agency, said the fire gutted about half the vessel, and that 23 bodies had been recovered.
Witnesses told MetroTV that the fire broke out about 15 minutes after the ferry left the port of Muara Angke.
The cause of the fire wasn't clear. Some passengers told local media they first saw smoke coming from the ferry's engine.
The director for sea transportation, Tonny Budiono, said the initial suspicion was that the fire was ""most probably caused by a short circuit in the engine room.""

CHINA
Domestic Ivory Trade To End This Year
Beijing said it would ban all domestic ivory trade by the end of 2017, closing the world's biggest ivory market in a move wildlife conservationists said they believe will help curb elephant poaching in Africa.
The announcement deals a blow to a global ivory industry sustained in large part by Chinese demand, and comes after years of international and domestic pressure on Beijing to interdict a trade that has threatened the extinction of wild African elephants.
""China's announcement is a game changer for elephant conservation,"" said Carter Roberts, chief executive of World Wildlife Fund. ""The large-scale trade of ivory now faces its twilight years.""
In a directive published late Friday, the State Council--China's cabinet--said the shutdown of the domestic ivory industry would take place in phases, with an initial group of processing plants and retail outlets due to close by the end of March.
Government agencies will assist ivory-industry workers in their transition to related professions, such as wood and bone carving or artifact-restoration in museums.
Current owners of ivory products will be allowed to keep them, transfer them as gifts, bequeath them to descendants, or sell them at supervised auctions after securing official approval.
Authorities will also step up enforcement against ivory-related businesses and launch campaigns to educate the public on the iniquities of the ivory trade.

Factory-Output Data Show Slower Growth
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 5 of 1177

A key gauge of factory output edged down in December, pointing to slowing momentum in China's economy, though leaving it on target to hit the government's growth target of at least 6.5% for 2016.
The official manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to 51.4 in December from 51.7 the previous month, according to official data, indicating the world's second-largest economy continued to expand, though at a slower rate. The index has stayed above the 50 mark that separates an expansion of activity from a contraction for five straight months.
""The momentum is becoming less strong, but it's still in expansionary territory,"" said HSBC economist Ma Xiaoping. ""The momentum will weaken further, but not likely run into contraction in coming months.""
The slightly weaker PMI reading for December comes as Beijing pulls back from the easy-money policy on which it depended for much of the year to bolster the economy.
Policy makers are confident the economy will reach the annual growth target of 6.5% to 7%, while they are growing increasingly concerned about rising corporate debt levels, economists said.
China's nonfinancial corporate debt is about 145% of gross domestic product, which is ""high by any measure,"" according to the International Monetary Fund.

Manufacturing Grew Faster in December
Expansion in the manufacturing sector accelerated sharply in December, Markit Economics said, reflecting another increase in the volume of new orders, as well as growth of employment and exports.
A survey of 300 industrial companies showed that the manufacturing purchasing managers index, a gauge of manufacturing activity, was at 54.3 in December compared with 51.9 in November.
A PMI figure below 50 indicates a contraction in activity, while a number above that level signals expansion.
Inflationary pressure increased rapidly in December because of a weaker zloty as well as higher prices of metals and oil, Markit also said. Poland's consumer prices rose 0.8% in annual terms in December, the Polish statistics office said.

Putin Lauds Populace After a Tough 2016
President Vladimir Putin delivered a videotaped address to his countrymen on Saturday evening, congratulating them on the New Year's holiday while acknowledging that 2016 wasn't easy for Russia.

""2016 is ending,"" the Russian president said. ""It was not easy, but the difficulties that we faced united us and prompted to open the huge reserves of our ability to move forward.""
Mr. Putin was front and center in world affairs in 2016. The Obama administration has accused the Kremlin of orchestrating cyberattacks aimed at influencing the outcome of the U.S. presidential elections.
The U.S. government last week imposed new sanctions on Moscow and expelled Russians it alleged were intelligence operatives serving under diplomatic cover.
But in a surprise move, Mr. Putin said Russia wouldn't retaliate by expelling U.S. diplomats. The Kremlin is hoping for a thaw in U.S.-Russian relations once President-elect Donald Trump takes office.
Russia has also advanced a plan for brokering an end to the war in Syria, hammering out a cease-fire deal there with Turkey backing talks in Kazakhstan in January aimed at ending the fighting.

Gunmen Storm Prison, Free 10 Inmates
Gunmen armed with automatic rifles and pistols stormed a Bahraini prison, killing a police officer and freeing 10 inmates convicted on terrorism charges, police said.
The attack on Jaw prison represents a significant escalation of the simmering unrest that has gripped the island nation off the coast of Saudi Arabia since its 2011 Arab Spring protests, which saw the nation's Shiite majority and others demand more political freedoms from the country's Sunni rulers. No group claimed responsibility for the assault.
The attack sparked a manhunt across the island. Confusion about the escape persisted for hours afterward, as the Interior Ministry issued a series of tweets in Arabic and English contradicting each other.
Early Monday, the Interior Ministry said the attack was launched by ""a terrorist cell of four to six members armed with automatic rifles and pistols.""
It named the dead police officer as Abdulsalam Saif Ahmed and said a second officer suffered moderate wounds in the attack.

HSBC,Peak Auto Sales Make 2017 a Waiting Game for Investors; Low valuations suggest an earnings downturn is on its way," Jan 3, 2017",1,"
In cyclical industries, the best of times for manufacturers tend to be the worst of times for investors.
The auto sector is a case in point. Car sales are running ahead of their precrisis peak in the U.S., but earnings multiples, even after a postelection bounce, are meager by historical standards. Investors should probably interpret low valuations as a warning flag rather than a discount sticker: A downturn in earnings is surely on its way.
The cycle is most mature in U.S. light-vehicle sales, which doubled over the seven years through November 2015 to an annualized peak of 18.1 million units. In 2016, following the first increase in the federal-funds rate since the recovery started, sales stalled . Now the Federal Reserve is signaling a faster pace of rate increases . More than seven in 10 new cars sold in the U.S. are financed with debt, according to research group IHS, which expects 17.4 million light-vehicle sales in 2017.
As the period running into the 2007 credit crunch showed, the problem with even flattish sales is that it encourages manufacturers to sacrifice their profits in a fight for market share. There are early warning signs that this is happening again: Industry inventories have been rising , and rebates with them. Of the Detroit Three, Ford may be best placed to deal with this more difficult market environment, having called an end to the boom in July and announced production cuts in October--earlier than its peers.
The picture is slightly brighter in Europe, if only because the eurozone crisis delayed the recovery by a few years in parts of the continent. Across the European Union, car registrations for the year through November were up 7.1% from the previous year.
With U.K. sales already running well ahead of the 2007 peak, growth is being driven by pent-up demand in Southern Europe. HSBC said it expects Italian consumers to buy about 1.9 million cars this year, roughly a fifth more than last year but still far below the 2.5 million vehicles sold in 2007. This suggests there is gas left in the tank, which is a boon to local market leader Fiat Chrysler in particular. The not insignificant risk is that consumer sentiment is thrown off course by a political or banking crisis in Italy, or a renewal of the eurozone crisis more generally.
Yet growth hopes are pinned above all on China . After a weak patch in the summer of 2015, a cut in sales tax was spectacularly successful in reviving the world's largest car market . This incentive has been scaled back for 2017 , which is likely to weigh on demand for smaller engines. But the bigger problem for Western car makers is more likely to be supply than demand: Production capacity is rising fast, including by increasingly sophisticated local
  PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 9 of 1177
manufacturers. Whatever its growth path, the Chinese market will become more competitive in 2017.
The year ahead could be a waiting game. Better buying opportunities are likely to emerge when times get a bit worse for car manufacturers.

HSBC,U.K. Regulator Raises Competition Concerns Over Mastercard's VocaLink Buy; The U.K. watchdog has sought assurances from the two companies," Jan 4, 2017",1,"LONDON--The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said Wednesday Mastercard Inc.'s acquisition of VocaLink gives rise to competition concerns, and it is seeking undertakings from the companies to address these issues.
They have until Jan. 11 to offer a solution or the regulator will refer the deal for an in-depth investigation, it said.
Last July Mastercard said it was buying 92.4% of VocaLink Holdings Ltd. in a deal valued around $920 million. If the deal is completed, a majority of VocaLink's current owners will retain a 7.6% stake for at least three years.
Mastercard U.K. Holdco Ltd., a unit of Mastercard, already owns and operates credit- and debit-card schemes Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus, and has bid to supply infrastructure services to U.K. interbank payment systems.
VocaLink's technology provides the backbone for non-card transactions such as employer-payroll deposits and consumer-bill payments, processing over 90% of salaries, more than 70% of household bills and almost all state benefits in the U.K.
It also unites the infrastructure of Britain's automated-teller-machine network among its participating banks via the LINK network. VocaLink reported $240 million in revenue last year and processed more than 11 billion transactions.
The regulator said its main concern is the LINK ATM network as VocaLink and Mastercard are two of the three most credible providers of infrastructure services to the network across the U.K. As such, it believes the merger
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 11 of 1177
would reduce the number of bidders and limit the ability of the LINK scheme to obtain good value when tendering for an infrastructure provider.
""The LINK ATM network provides an essential service for millions of customers. It's important that LINK has a good choice of providers when it comes to supplying the necessary infrastructure so it can take advantage of the opening up of payment systems to competition,"" Andrea Coscelli, acting chief executive of the CMA, and decision maker in this case, said.
""These concerns warrant a closer investigation in the event that Mastercard cannot address them at this stage,"" she said.
Mastercard said it would address this concern within the time frame provided.
VocaLink is owned by a consortium of 18 banks and building societies, with the four biggest being Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, Barclays PLC, HSBC Holdings PLC, and Lloyds Banking Group PLC.
Last July, after the deal was announced, the U.K. Payment Systems Regulator said the four largest shareholders of VocaLink should sell all, or part of their holdings in the infrastructure provider if its acquisition by Mastercard doesn't go ahead, to open up the market and boost competition.
At the time of the deal, RBS confirmed it would sell its 21.4% shareholding in VocaLink and book a £150 million ($183.6 million) pretax gain in its accounts. Barclays also said it sold 13.68% of its shareholding in VocaLink for £104 million, leaving it with a 1.5% stake.

HSBC,Deutsche Bank's Anti-Financial-Crime Chief to Quit Post; Peter Hazlewood stepping down after budget dispute over hiring hundreds more workers," Jan 4, 2017",1,"
The head of Deutsche Bank AG's financial-crime-fighting unit is leaving that post after an internal budget dispute over his requests to add hundreds of new employees, according to people familiar with the matter.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 13 of 1177
Peter Hazlewood, who has been in the job six months, will be replaced as soon as next week, the people said. He might stay at Deutsche Bank in another role, but he will no longer run the group overseeing controls to prevent money laundering and violations of financial laws globally, the people said.
Mr. Hazlewood didn't respond to requests for comment. He was on an initial six-month contract that will expire in mid-January, one of the people said.
The position is central to the lender's relationships with regulators, as well as its ability to avoid legal pitfalls, at a time when it still faces an array of costly regulatory challenges.
Deutsche Bank last month agreed to basic terms of a $7.2 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Department to end a series of mortgage-securities probes . The bank still faces an anticipated smaller fine from the U.S. government following an investigation of Russian stock trades.
That investigation has raised questions about Deutsche Bank's ability to police potential money laundering. The trades in question occurred before Mr. Hazlewood joined Deutsche Bank.
As the bank's official money-laundering reporting officer, Mr. Hazlewood signs off on documentation with regulators attesting to the bank's controls and compliance.
In December, tensions arose between Mr. Hazlewood and more senior executives about planning for 2017, with Mr. Hazlewood asking for more new employees and other resources than his bosses were inclined to approve, the people said.
At the same time, some executives were unhappy with elements of his management style and leadership of the business, according to one person familiar with high-level discussions inside the bank. Those who expressed dissatisfaction included his supervisor, Sylvie Matherat, Deutsche Bank's chief regulatory officer and a member of its management board.
Tensions flared last week when budgets were being finalized, the people close to the discussions said. Mr. Hazlewood had asked to hire more than 600 people in 2017 to help bulk up compliance and anti-money-laundering efforts and handle financial-crime investigations, people familiar with the matter said.
Senior executives approved close to 400 additional employees, the people said. The hiring will bring the global anti- financial crime unit to about 1,160 people, the people said.
A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman said Wednesday that the bank has committed to increasing its 2016 anti-crime unit headcount by 50% by the end of 2017. The bank doesn't publicly disclose the unit's size or budget.
Mr. Hazlewood and other managers in the group complained that without the 200 more people requested, Deutsche Bank would lag behind competitors and struggle to complete projects and adequately beef up its anticrime teams and technology.
The arguments fueled discussions about whether Mr. Hazlewood should continue in the role, the people said. His planned departure was earlier reported by Germany's Manager Magazin.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 14 of 1177

Deutsche Bank executives plan to name a successor as soon as next week, pending management approval of an internal candidate, one person briefed on internal discussions said.
Mr. Hazlewood previously worked at HSBC Holdings PLC and Standard Chartered PLC. In announcing his appointment in April 2016, Deutsche Bank called him ""an experienced career financial crime professional"" with 28 years of experience at large financial institutions.
He joined after a high-level management shake-up in 2015 that included the appointment of John Cryan as chief executive and a near-complete makeover of the bank's management ranks. Ms. Matherat joined the management board in November 2015, and she and her colleagues have focused in part on overhauling compliance globally, seeking to end a series of legal missteps that have cost Deutsche Bank billions of dollars.

A lawyer for Mr. Katz couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
The efforts included coordinating bids and offers, and agreeing to quote certain prices to specific customers, the agency said.
Five banks including Barclays pleaded guilty in May 2015 and paid $5.6 billion in penalties to resolve investigation s into whether the banks worked together to manipulate foreign currency prices.
In a separate case that grew out of the investigations, prosecutors in July charged two HSBC Holdings PLC employees with fraudulently front-running a $3.5 billion currency trade for a client. The HSBC traders have pleaded not guilty.
According to a plea agreement entered in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday, Mr. Katz agreed to cooperate in the ongoing investigation. He faces up to 10 years in prison.

U.K. Regulator Raises Competition Concerns Over Mastercard's VocaLink Buy U.S., Europe Spat Over Bank Risk Set to Drag On
Behind China's Tightened Monetary Stance
China's top leadership has hinted at a slightly tightened monetary stance in 2017. But bubbling below that seemingly unified goal are long-simmering tensions among various financial regulators, each with its own thoughts on what policy measures are appropriate.
A divergence between the People's Bank of China and the China Banking Regulatory Commission came into focus in a recent speech by an official at the banking regulator.
Yu Xuejun said China should cut the amount of money that banks are required to hold in reserves at the central bank, adding that other financing tools could be used to adjust liquidity after a cut, according to a report last week by state-owned Shanghai Securities News. Reducing the required reserve ratio, or RRR, would let banks lend more.
Tools like medium-term lending facilities, where the central bank agrees to lend to banks at a set rate for a few months, shouldn't be overused before a cut, Mr. Yu said.
But senior party officials at the recent Central Economic Work Conference have called for ""prudent and neutral"" policy this year. That language, shifting from ""accommodative"" in their previous statements, implies that the central bank will refrain from cutting RRR for banks, much less lower interest rates, according to analysts.
The dissonance in rhetoric lies in different regulators' priorities. The banking commission looks out for banks, which in China are buckling under a surge of bad loans coupled with slowing economic growth. The central bank looks out for the broader financial system and attempts to address risk wherever it may arise, from trying to deleverage the local bond market to curbing declines in the yuan and arresting capital flight. Increasingly, it is also taking on a coordinator role between China's various lumbering regulatory groups.
Cutting banks' reserve requirement ratios risks adding to the cash flowing out of China--the exact situation the leadership wants to prevent. The last time the central bank cut RRR was in March 2016, when it took the ratio down 0.5 percentage point to 17% for the largest banks. Since then, it has stuck with more flexible money-market instruments to adjust the supply of funds in the financial system, even though such measures are more expensive for banks.
Zhu Chaoping, an economist at UOB Kay Hian in Shanghai, said to ""expect more fine-tune measures"" this year, but not an RRR cut. The use medium- and short-term lending facilities started in 2015 and authorities are increasingly formalizing them as tools to adjust borrowing costs, he explained.
Given Mr. Yu's relatively narrow role at the banking regulator of overseeing state-owned financial institutions, his opinion might not carry much sway.
But his comments illustrate the need for more coordination between Chinese regulators. Similar policy tussles
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 21 of 1177

have surfaced between the central bank and National Development Reform Commission, the country's economic planner.
Unfortunately, analysts say last year's talk of consolidating regulation has fizzled out. China's undeniable message right now is stability at all costs.
Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond
Wall Street Lawyer Jay Clayton Emerges as Top Candidate for SEC Chairman By Dave Michaels and Michael C. Bender
WASHINGTON--Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton has emerged as the leading candidate to be chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and could be announced as the nominee as soon as Wednesday, according to an official working with the transition team of President-elect Donald Trump.
Mr. Clayton, whose clients have included Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Barclays Capital Inc., would succeed SEC Chairman Mary Jo White, another lawyer with a history of representing Wall Street banks before becoming a regulator. Mr. Clayton, who met with Mr. Trump on Dec. 22, is a partner at Sullivan &Cromwell LLP, where he also worked on the 2014 initial public offering of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., according to Sullivan's website.
Mr. Trump has also considered Debra Wong Yang, who served as a U.S. attorney during the administration of former President George W. Bush, for the role of chairman. Mr. Clayton appears to have surpassed Ms. Yang, a partner at Gibson Dunn &Crutcher LLP based in Los Angeles, as the most likely candidate to run the SEC, which oversees the $27 trillion U.S. equity market. Mr. Clayton has spent his career working on the kinds of securities deals that the SEC has a hand in regulating.
Reached on his cellphone Tuesday evening, Mr. Clayton said he couldn't talk and hung up.
Mr. Clayton would become the latest Trump appointee with longstanding Wall Street ties, joining former Goldman executive Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump's choice for Treasury secretary; former Goldman President Gary Cohn, who will run the National Economic Council; and private-equity investor Wilbur Ross, the pick to head the Commerce Department.
Mr. Clayton represented Goldman when it received a $5 billion investment from billionaire Warren Buffett's company during the peak of the credit crisis in September 2008, according to his bio on Sullivan's website. He's also represented Goldman in connection with other investments and acquisitions, according to the law firm. Sullivan is a key outside legal adviser for Goldman and is more closely associated with Wall Street than perhaps any other law firm.
Mr. Clayton has a wide-ranging corporate practice spanning mergers and acquisitions, IPOs, corporate governance, and investment advice for high-net-worth families. Other matters that Mr. Clayton has worked on include advising Morgan Stanley on the sale of its physical oil-trading division and Bear Stearns on its sale to J.P. Morgan Chase &Co.--two deals shaped heavily by the financial crisis and its aftermath--and the 2014 IPO of Moelis &Co., a boutique advisory firm. He's also represented an ownership group for the Atlanta Hawks and British Airways in its 2010 merger with Iberia.

Mr. Clayton would take over the SEC at a time when congressional Republicans are pressuring the agency to loosen fundraising rules for smaller public companies, lighten its oversight of private-equity firms, and repeal executive-compensation rules opposed by corporations.
He would be one of at least three new members to join the SEC this year. The agency has two unfilled commissioner posts in addition to the chairman's role, which Ms. White will give up on Jan. 20.
Two other securities lawyers who have advised the Trump transition team, Paul Atkins and Ralph Ferrara, also have been viewed as possible candidates to run the SEC. Mr. Atkins, the chief executive officer of Patomak Global Partners, met with Mr. Trump in late November and is also regarded as a candidate to become vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.

Liberal groups and Democratic senators are zeroing in on the record of Steven Mnuchin, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Treasury secretary, aiming to pressure Republicans into voting against his nomination. The campaign is part of a larger effort by Democrats to derail some of Mr. Trump's nominees.
The senators and groups are painting Mr. Mnuchin as an executive who oversaw thousands of foreclosures during the financial crisis while at the helm of OneWest Bank. Buying the bank, formerly known as IndyMac, eventually earned Mr. Mnuchin hundreds of millions of dollars. It is now part of CIT Group Inc.
The liberal group Allied Progress is launching a six-figure television ad campaign in Arizona and Nevada to call on Sens. Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.) and Dean Heller (R., Nev.) to vote against Mr. Mnuchin's nomination.
""Mnuchin made millions after his bank foreclosed on homeowners,"" the ads say. They also accuse the bank of discriminating against prospective Latino home buyers, citing a complaint filed in November with the Department of Housing and Urban Development by two California-based housing organizations.
Both Sens. Heller and Flake criticized Mr. Trump for some of his conduct during the presidential campaign, and both face re-election campaigns in 2018 in states with rapidly growing Latino populations. Both states were hit particularly hard with foreclosures during the financial crisis.
Representatives for Mr. Flake and Mr. Heller didn't respond to requests for comment.
Tara Bradshaw, a spokeswoman for Mr. Mnuchin, said that he had ""tirelessly worked to help families stay in their homes"" during his time at OneWest. The bank was a ""modification machine,"" not a ""foreclosure machine,"" as Democrats allege, she said.
""The complaints filed by two California housing groups are grossly misleading since they rely on lending figures for time periods after OneWest sold its primary mortgage business,"" Ms. Bradshaw said. ""During the time period the groups focus on, OneWest originated only a very small number of mortgages to anyone, because during that time period OneWest had sold its primary mortgage platform.""

Opponents also are poring over records related to OneWest's activities while Mr. Mnuchin was there, particularly with regard to the legality of its foreclosure practices.
OneWest is under civil investigation by HUD for loan-servicing practices. CIT, OneWest's parent company, has said it is ""committed to fair-lending and works hard to meet the credit needs of all communities and neighborhoods we serve.""
The campaign against Mr. Mnuchin comes as Senate Democrats plan out how to proceed with Mr. Trump's cabinet nominees and try to exact political damage on the new administration, even if they can't block any of the nominations.
""Looking at the cabinet, which is stacked with billionaires, corporate executives, titans of Wall Street, and those deeply embedded in Washington's corridors of power, it seems that many of his campaign themes are quickly being abandoned,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Tuesday.
Late last year, Senate Democrats--led by Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Bernie Sanders of Vermont--launched a website to solicit the stories of homeowners who were foreclosed on by OneWest during Mr. Mnuchin's time at the bank.
They have drawn attention to particular examples of aggressive foreclosure practices by the bank, including a case in which a Minneapolis homeowner was locked out of her home during a blizzard.
Ms. Warren has been particularly vocal in her criticism of Mr. Mnuchin, writing in a statement last month that ""Mnuchin swooped in after the crash to take a second bite out of families by aggressively--and sometimes illegally- -foreclosing on their homes,"" after ""peddling the kind of dangerous mortgage-backed securities that eventually blew up the economy.""
Additionally, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, wrote to Mr. Mnuchin asking him questions on a variety of banking and housing policies, including several related to his time in the financial services industry.
Mr. Mnuchin won't be providing written answers to those questions, Ms. Bradshaw said.
""The American public deserves to know where Mr. Mnuchin stands on these basic, straightforward questions about important housing and finance issues that he'll oversee,"" a spokesman for Sen. Brown said.
Mr. Brown will have an opportunity to question Mr. Mnuchin as a member of the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Treasury secretary's nomination.
CFTC Chairman Timothy Massad to Step Down Jan. 20 By Dave Michaels and Andrew Ackerman
WASHINGTON--Timothy Massad plans to step down as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Jan. 20, after nearly three years at the helm of the top U.S. derivatives regulator, the agency said Tuesday.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 24 of 1177

The departure, which was expected, is set to coincide with the end of the Obama administration. Mr. Massad, a Democrat, has sought to complete stricter rules for the multitrillion-dollar swaps market. His departure opens the door for a Republican successor who could ease or unwind some of his efforts.
President-elect Donald Trump will appoint the CFTC's next leader, adding to the bounty of financial appointees who could loosen the reins on Wall Street after years of tighter supervision under Democrats. Mr. Trump also is expected to appoint a new SEC chairman, a vice chairman for supervision at the Federal Reserve as well as a new comptroller of the currency.
J. Christopher Giancarlo, the CFTC's sole Republican member, is expected to succeed Mr. Massad, at least on an interim basis. Mr. Giancarlo is also under consideration to fill the top CFTC role on a permanent basis, according to people who have spoken with the Trump transition team.
Mr. Massad's resignation plans mirror the exit of Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo White, who announced in November that she would leave the top U.S. markets regulator at the close of the Obama administration.
Mr. Massad has said the CFTC is underfunded given the scope of its oversight. His departure will leave the agency with just two commissioners: Mr. Giancarlo and Sharon Bowen, a Democrat. That will make it even harder for the undermanned agency to get anything done, given government sunshine laws that prevent commissioners from making decisions outside of public meetings.
The remaining commissioners will at least have a neighbor for a bit longer. While Mr. Massad plans to step down as chairman, he will stick around for a ""few weeks in order to close out his office and handle administrative matters,"" the agency said in a news release.
In the press release Mr. Massad laid out a number of policy priorities he spearheaded, including the regulatory framework for trading and reporting swaps, products that accelerated the damage from the 2008 financial crisis. ""I came to the CFTC with a number of priorities, and I am proud we have made significant progress in every area,"" he said.
Mr. Giancarlo may seek to ease some of the CFTC's postcrisis rules--particularly swaps-trading requirements that he says have sent trading business overseas. But he has backed broad mandates for overhauling the swaps market, including the requirement that many be processed through clearinghouses, entities that guarantee trades in case one side defaults. He also could push for the introduction of examinations for swaps traders and brokers.
Mr. Massad took over the CFTC in June 2014, succeeding Gary Gensler, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive who gained a reputation as an aggressive regulator. European policy makers repeatedly chafed at Mr. Gensler's efforts to quickly and aggressively impose U.S. rules for derivatives overseas. Mr. Massad made smoothing those relations a priority after he took over.
In one of his biggest accomplishments, Mr. Massad succeeded last year in ending a lengthy impasse between the U.S. and Europe over the regulation of clearinghouses.
But in other areas he fell short of his own expectations. Last month, for instance, he failed to complete controversial curbs on commodities trading. Instead of finishing the position-limit rules, Mr. Massad opted to rewrite the proposal for the third time since 2011. That will allow the Trump administration, which has said it would
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 25 of 1177

dismantle the Dodd-Frank law calling for the rules, to finish them.
Mr. Massad told reporters he didn't want to complete rules that a commission under Republican leadership would be unlikely to implement or enforce.
Republican lawmakers were cordial with the CFTC chairman but refused to boost the agency's budget above $250 million for the past three years. Mr. Massad has said the agency lacks the resources to advance priorities such as testing the cybersecurity controls of firms it oversees.
He also clashed with members of his own party over bank-safety rules completed a year ago. The measure eased proposed requirements that banks set aside cash to offset the risk of losses on certain swaps trades, bucking objections from Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other Democrats who wanted a stricter approach.
Mr. Massad defended the rules, which covered collateral known as margin, as ""very strong,"" and said they were nearly identical to restrictions imposed by fellow U.S. regulators and similar to those imposed overseas.
Fidelity International Gets Nod to Sell Investment Products in China By Rachel Rosenthal
Chinese financial regulators have given Fidelity International the green light to offer local investment products to wealthy mainland investors, making it the first major foreign fund manager to get such a permission.
The company's Chinese operation, FIL Investment Management (Shanghai) Co., has this week registered with the Asset Management Association of China as a private fund-management company. That step allows the firm to create investment products to sell to Chinese institutional and high-net-worth investors, the firm said Wednesday.
The move marks China's latest effort to open up its financial markets to foreigners, and could herald further opportunities for global money managers to set up shop without an onshore partner.
""This is a very significant milestone in our expansion into the world's second-biggest economy,"" said Daisy Ho, managing director, Asia Pacific ex-Japan, at Fidelity International. ""The potential for the onshore market is huge.""
To date, only a handful of global investment firms have gained approval to operate wholly-owned investment companies in China, allowing them to operate as stand-alone money managers. The list includes J.P. Morgan Asset Management, U.S. hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and U.K.-based Aberdeen Asset Management. Fidelity's registration with AMAC, an industry body that is supervised by the country's securities regulator, will allow it to actually sell products in China, the next step in the process.
Since 2001, most asset managers looking to do business in China have set up joint-venture arrangements with partners onshore. Roughly 40 fund managers have established such relationships.
The benefit of going solo is that ""you finally get to control your own destiny,"" said Peter Alexander, founder and managing director of Shanghai consultancy Z-Ben Advisors. ""You can hire who you want to hire, and won't have to spend time on negotiating politics. What you can do in your businesses in Boston, New York or Hong Kong, you can now do in Shanghai.""
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 26 of 1177

Fidelity International has a six-month window to launch its first product onshore. The platform will be available only to institutional clients and high-net-worth investors, which includes individuals with financial assets of no less than 3 million yuan ($430,000) or personal annual average income of no less than 500,000 yuan for the past three years.
The firm's registration is the latest development in China's recent effort to welcome foreign investors to its markets. In December, China launched a trading link between the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock markets, and last February officials lifted restrictions on foreign investors in China's main bond market.
Still, investors have met these efforts with caution. China's yuan has weakened sharply against a resurgent U.S. dollar--falling nearly 7% against the greenback in 2016, and is approaching the psychologically important level of 7 yuan per U.S. dollar. China's bond market has been rattled by regulators' recent campaign to deleverage and tighten monetary conditions, and its stock market was one of Asia's worst-performing last year.
""We understand there will continue to be volatility in China's markets,"" said Ms. Ho. ""But because of our nature, our vision is for long-term growth.""
Fidelity International will have to compete with Chinese peers, who have a well-established presence on the ground. Still, the firm has more than a decade of experience operating in China, with a staff of 400 employees there.
The firm has mainly offered domestic institutional clients and retail investors the ability to invest offshore. The firm also has a quota of $1.2 billion under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor Scheme, a program that allows international investors to buy Chinese stocks and bonds with yuan raised outside China. That is one of the largest amounts held by any fund manager globally.
Established in 1969 as the international arm of Fidelity Investments, Fidelity International split from the U.S. organization in 1980, and is today owned mainly by management and members of the original founding family.
WSJ Pro: U.K. Regulator Raises Competition Concerns Over Mastercard's VocaLink Buy By Ian Walker
LONDON--The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said Wednesday Mastercard Inc.'s acquisition of VocaLink gives rise to competition concerns, and it is seeking undertakings from the companies to address these issues.
They have until Jan. 11 to offer a solution or the regulator will refer the deal for an in-depth investigation, it said.
Last July Mastercard said it was buying 92.4% of VocaLink Holdings Ltd. in a deal valued around $920 million. If the deal is completed, a majority of VocaLink's current owners will retain a 7.6% stake for at least three years.
Mastercard U.K. Holdco Ltd., a unit of Mastercard, already owns and operates credit- and debit-card schemes Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus, and has bid to supply infrastructure services to U.K. interbank payment systems.
VocaLink's technology provides the backbone for non-card transactions such as employer-payroll deposits and consumer-bill payments, processing over 90% of salaries, more than 70% of household bills and almost all state benefits in the U.K.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 27 of 1177

It also unites the infrastructure of Britain's automated-teller-machine network among its participating banks via the LINK network. VocaLink reported $240 million in revenue last year and processed more than 11 billion transactions.
The regulator said its main concern is the LINK ATM network as VocaLink and Mastercard are two of the three most credible providers of infrastructure services to the network across the U.K. As such, it believes the merger would reduce the number of bidders and limit the ability of the LINK scheme to obtain good value when tendering for an infrastructure provider.
""The LINK ATM network provides an essential service for millions of customers. It's important that LINK has a good choice of providers when it comes to supplying the necessary infrastructure so it can take advantage of the opening up of payment systems to competition,"" Andrea Coscelli, acting chief executive of the CMA, and decision maker in this case, said.
""These concerns warrant a closer investigation in the event that Mastercard cannot address them at this stage,"" she said.
Mastercard said it would address this concern within the time frame provided.
VocaLink is owned by a consortium of 18 banks and building societies, with the four biggest being Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, Barclays PLC, HSBC Holdings PLC, and Lloyds Banking Group PLC.
Last July, after the deal was announced, the U.K. Payment Systems Regulator said the four largest shareholders of VocaLink should sell all, or part of their holdings in the infrastructure provider if its acquisition by Mastercard doesn't go ahead, to open up the market and boost competition.
At the time of the deal, RBS confirmed it would sell its 21.4% shareholding in VocaLink and book a £150 million ($183.6 million) pretax gain in its accounts. Barclays also said it sold 13.68% of its shareholding in VocaLink for £104 million, leaving it with a 1.5% stake.
U.S., Europe Spat Over Bank Risk Set to Drag On By Julia-Ambra Verlaine and Max Colchester
BRUSSELS--A fight between U.S. and European authorities over how banks should calculate the riskiness of their assets will drag out into 2017, extending lingering uncertainty over the health of lenders' balance sheets.
After months of intense lobbying by European banks, the international standards setter, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Tuesday delayed a key meeting.
European authorities complained that new proposed rules would force their banks to thicken capital cushions and stymie lending.
""The committee came to recognize the initial set of proposals was an overshoot,"" said a person familiar with the discussions.

Indonesia's Message to J.P. Morgan: Accentuate the Positive By Carolyn Cui, Emily Glazer, Ben Otto and Rachel Rosenthal
Indonesia's decision to cut business ties with J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. after a downgrade highlights the fine line banks and ratings companies walk.
In the banking world, securities analysts are supposed to provide independent, unvarnished investment advice to their commission-paying clients, but a negative word can alienate clients on the other side--the stock and bond issuers that pay banks large fees to help them raise capital. That can cost bankers' access to corporate executives or government officials, and lose them business from the offended issuers.
Emerging-country governments often react strongly to sovereign-ratings downgrades, which can raise the cost of borrowing in international capital markets. The offense in this case, though, was a downgrade of Indonesia's stocks, partly occasioned by Donald Trump's U.S. election win--a ratings change that the country's finance ministry said could destabilize the financial system.
The ministry responded by ending all partnerships with J.P. Morgan as of Jan. 1, including the bank's role as a government-appointed primary dealer in certain bond auctions. For a nation to completely cut off a bank that way appears rare. It was a first for Indonesia.
The decision was the product of several run-ins between Southeast Asia's biggest country and the largest U.S. bank by assets, the ministry's director of debt portfolio and strategy, Schneider Siahaan, told The Wall Street Journal.
It was the third time a J.P. Morgan ratings call threatened to exacerbate selloffs, Mr. Siahaan said--in 2008 and 2015 Indonesia issued warnings to the bank after its research division downgraded the government's rupiah bonds--and the government believes J.P. Morgan has a conflict of interest.
""As a bonds dealer, J.P. Morgan was tasked to find buyers, but at the same time they issued a recommendation to sell,"" Mr. Siahaan said. ""We see they're no longer effective in carrying out their obligations.""
J.P. Morgan reiterated that its Indonesia business is operating as usual and that it is working for a resolution with the finance ministry. It declined to comment on possible conflicts of interest.
The bank was working toward improving its relationship with the country, according to a person familiar with the matter, when U.S. voters elected Mr. Trump. Then, in a Nov. 13 report about the global repercussions of Mr. Trump's victory, J.P. Morgan downgraded Indonesian equities to underweight from overweight, saying that a rise in bond-market volatility ""increases emerging-market risk premiums.""
The report, authored by six analysts led by veteran Asian strategist Adrian Mowat, also made smaller downgrades to Brazilian and Turkish equities.
Mr. Mowat wasn't available for comment.
The next day, the yield on Indonesia's 10-year government bond shot up 0.466 percentage point, its biggest intraday jump since January 2011, to 7.895%. Yields rise as prices fall.

While Indonesia's debt leverage is relatively low for Asia, its external debt is among the highest when measured against foreign-exchange reserves, according to Standard Chartered. That essentially makes Indonesia more vulnerable than other Asian countries to a stronger dollar and higher U.S. interest rates, as does the relatively high proportion of government debt held by foreigners--nearly 40% of rupiah bonds and almost 90% of U.S. dollar bonds.
In some cases, banks under fire for negative opinions have sought to placate issuers--or make amends for analysis that could be seen as unfair--by firing employees or rewriting reports after publication.
Ratings firms can face similar heat.
The U.S. Treasury called Standard &Poor's decision to strip the country of its top credit rating in 2011 ""flawed."" When Standard &Poor's cut Poland's credit rating to BBB-plus from A-minus a year ago, citing its new government's radical policies, the finance minister at the time, Pawel Szalamacha, called the decision ""incomprehensible...from economic and financial-analysis point of view.""
'It is nonsense that Japan's national strength is lower than African countries to which Japan is providing assistance.'
--Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi in 2002
When Moody's Investors Service downgraded its outlook for China's sovereign rating last March, citing a slowing economy and shrinking foreign reserves, state-run news agency Xinhua answered with an editorial accusing it of ""practices that are damaging its own reputation""--namely, holding emerging and developed economies to different standards. Moody's declined to comment.
In the early 2000s the government of Japan blasted all three of the major credit-rating companies for downgrades, including one from Moody's that rated the country's yen debt riskier than Botswana bonds. ""It is nonsense that Japan's national strength is lower than African countries to which Japan is providing assistance,"" said then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi at the time.
A government outcry over an equities call, like Indonesia's response to J.P. Morgan, is much rarer.
""There's instances of sovereigns railing against rating agencies where formal ratings are applied, which do have more real financial or economic consequences,"" said Mark Baker, emerging-markets portfolio manager at Standard Life Investments in Hong Kong. ""I don't ever recall seeing an instance where a change of outlook from a bank elicited such a response.""

Equifax, TransUnion Settle CFPB Claims of Deceptive Marketing
By Rachel Witkowski
WASHINGTON--Top credit-reporting companies Equifax Inc. and TransUnion have agreed to pay more than $23 million over federal claims that they deceptively marketed and sold credit scores to consumers.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 30 of 1177

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Tuesday that Atlanta-based Equifax and Chicago-based TransUnion--two of the three largest credit-reporting firms--falsely advertised how lenders use credit scores and deceptively charged consumers for subscriptions to check their own score.
Credit reporting firms are required by law to provide one free credit report to consumers every year. Consumers typically end up seeing their credit score or report when applying for a loan, and some banks now offer the score free as part of a bank account.
Equifax and TransUnion collectively have agreed to pay more than $17.6 million in restitution to consumers and $5.5 million in fines, without admitting or denying the CFPB's findings.
""TransUnion and Equifax deceived consumers about the usefulness of the credit scores they marketed, and lured consumers into expensive recurring payments with false promises,"" CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in written statement.
Equifax and TransUnion in separate statements said they already have fixed many of the issues raised by the CFPB. The cited activities occurred as early as July 2011 for both companies, and for Equifax continued through March 2014, according to the CFPB.
The CFPB said both companies and their subsidiaries falsely advertised a credit score to the consumer as the same score lenders use when underwriting a loan. A lender typically uses several different scores that can sometimes include those provided by Equifax and TransUnion to determine the interest rate and eligibility for a consumer credit.
The CFPB also accused Equifax of offering a free credit-score trial and TransUnion of offering a similar trial for $1"

HSBC,"When Jamie Dimon Met François Hollande: Inside France's Secret Plan to Lure Brexit Bankers; As they seek to capitalize on the fallout from Brexit, Europe's political leaders must navigate a minefield as they seek to lure banks from London"," Jan 5, 2017",1,"PARIS--French President Franc?ois Hollande met with J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. Chief Executive James Dimon in late October and asked how France could lure finance jobs away from London after Brexit.
Mr. Dimon's message was blunt: The chances that banks would move more employees to France were slim unless the country softens its strict labor laws.
Mr. Hollande--who had yet to announce he wasn't seeking re-election --reassured Mr. Dimon that change would come. But it would happen under his successor , he said.
""We understand,"" Mr. Hollande said, according to people familiar with the matter. ""It's complicated.""
The exchange at the E?lyse?e Palace illustrates the minefield Europe's political establishment is navigating as it seeks to capitalize on the U.K.'s June vote to leave the European Union . Cities across the continent are jockeying to lure jobs away from London , Europe's financial center. But with elections on the horizon in France, Germany and the Netherlands --and populist parties like Marine Le Pen's National Front gaining in the polls --governments are afraid to publicly court big banks with promises of favorable treatment.
Instead, Paris and other capitals have embarked on a round of quiet diplomacy with the financial industry to provide assurances that--whatever the results of this year's elections--the world's biggest banks can begin relocating their businesses from London.
In France, for example, Mr. Hollande's government has tapped Christian Noyer, former governor of the Bank of France, to act as a bridge to the next administration in negotiating and implementing new incentives to entice banks, according to people familiar with the matter.
Franc?ois Fillon, the conservative Les Re?publicains party's candidate to replace Mr. Hollande in the May presidential elections, has also met with banks to discuss their proposals, according to people familiar with the matter. On the campaign trail, Mr. Fillon has been a staunch critic of France's job protections.
Representatives of the French president's office and Mr. Fillon declined to comment. A spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan declined to comment.
Banks can't wait around. Brexit negotiations are due to start early this year , and executives have begun drawing up detailed plans that can be executed quickly if it looks as if the U.K. won't secure access to the EU's financial markets .
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 39 of 1177
Competition is heating up, and even scooping up a few thousand jobs would have an outsize effect on cities like Paris, Frankfurt or Dublin, whose financial centers are a fraction the size of London's. Their hand is strengthened by incoming rules that may force big non-EU banks to set up subsidiaries and hold extra capital if they want to be based in the trading bloc. This could force big lenders to set up substantial operations in the EU to service clients there regardless of what Brexit deal the U.K. strikes.
Meanwhile, uncertainty over the U.K. government's negotiating position has weakened the U.K.'s ability to entice banks to stay put, Andrew Bailey, a senior British finance regulator, recently told British lawmakers .
So far banks have largely concentrated on scaling up where they already have some operations. HSBC Holdings PLC has said it is focusing on Paris , where it already has a retail presence. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. officials say the bank is scoping out Frankfurt, where it has a banking license, and Citigroup Inc. is exploring moving several hundred jobs from London to Dublin if the U.K. loses access to the single European market, according to people familiar with the matter.
The political climate in France, however, is a stark example of the hurdles facing banks and the political establishment. Bankers in London worry Ms. Le Pen, an anti-immigrant euroskeptic, could win the French presidential election this year.
Mr. Hollande, a Socialist who once branded finance as his ""true adversary,"" knows the national labor code is contentious in France. Before the Brexit vote, the French leader tried to overhaul the labor system but was forced to water down the measures in the face of massive street protests .
In the wake of the Brexit vote, Mr. Hollande's finance minister, Michel Sapin, has rejected any talk of relaxing labor laws for banks, telling a conference on Oct. 27 that the government refused to create a ""special status for finance.""
Behind the scenes, however, French officials are looking at ways to accommodate lenders. Since mid-September, senior executives from banks in the U.S., Asia and the Persian Gulf have held confidential talks with French government officials about relocating some businesses after Brexit, according to the people familiar with the matter.
During the meetings, U.S. banking executives shared their concerns about the country's strict labor laws, which would make it hard for them to hire and fire high-paid bankers and traders, according to these people.
One option, a French official said, would involve allowing banks to easily fire employees that fall into certain European Banking Authority classifications.
""It's necessary if we want to be attractive,"" the official said. Inti Landauro contributed to this article.

The coming leadership change at the Securities and Exchange Commission could herald a new dawn for public companies.
The SEC will soon have a new chairman, Jay Clayton, nominated Wednesday by President-elect Donald Trump to run the regulator. Lawyers who specialize in corporate finance see hope in Mr. Trump's choice: Mr. Clayton is particularly attuned to how public companies interact with the laws that govern the stock and bond markets, given his focus on mergers, initial public offerings and other complex deals at Sullivan &Cromwell.
Mr. Clayton is the first corporate-finance and deals lawyer in decades to run the SEC. Lawyers who advise public companies have been abuzz that a member of their tribe was picked to head the regulator, said Meredith Cross, a partner at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale &Dorr LLP who previously regulated public-company disclosures at the SEC. Mr. Clayton is well positioned to achieve a goal that has languished for years: modernizing the way companies communicate information to investors.
While Warren Buffett has no problem reading a 10-K, any small investor who has ever spent time with one knows
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 42 of 1177
how abstruse and frighteningly complicated the annual reports can appear. And companies could probably provide all of that information in a more efficient way. Critics of the SEC's disclosure regime say onerous legal requirements help explain why more companies are staying private instead of going public.
""When you have done this forever, you know where the rules provide important protections and where you need to keep them, and you also have the perspective that some rules are overly complex and need modernization,"" Ms. Cross said in an interview Wednesday.
Critics of Mr. Trump's pick, including Democratic lawmakers, point to Mr. Clayton's work for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and other banks, suggesting that he'll have a deregulatory bias that will be comforting to big banks. Some Democrats also fear that simplifying disclosures is a Trojan horse for giving companies more discretion to hold back information that shareholders need.
To be sure, Mr. Clayton would take over the SEC at a time when Republicans will push legislation that would eliminate many rules required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. Lawmakers may also expect Mr. Clayton to delay other Dodd-Frank rules that haven't been finished, such as executive-pay disclosures that compare a CEO's compensation to the performance of his company's stock. That could put him on a collision course with Democratic SEC commissioners and make it harder to find common ground on efforts such as disclosure modernization.
But Mr. Clayton's history as a deals lawyer could also come in handy in navigating opposing factions, said Joseph Grundfest, a professor at Stanford Law School. ""A large part of government is how we figure out a deal that will get us a majority,"" Mr. Grundfest said in an interview Wednesday. ""Understanding Clayton as a person with tremendous deals experience to look for the middle road is a reason for optimism.""
Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond SEC Nominee Clayton Is a 180 From Chairman White
By Dave Michaels And Liz Hoffman
WASHINGTON--Donald Trump's nomination of veteran Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to end the streak of aggressive regulators and litigators overseeing the country's top markets cop.
Mr. Clayton, whose clients have included Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Barclays PLC, adds another figure with deep financial-industry ties to President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration. Mr. Clayton's experience as a partner at Sullivan &Cromwell LLP on big stock and bond deals--including the 2014 initial public offering of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.--signals Republicans prefer an SEC chairman who is attuned to the needs of Wall Street firms that prepare the markets when companies go to raise capital.
In one of his few public statements on policy, Mr. Clayton oversaw a 2011 New York State Bar Association report attacking the Obama-era SEC and Justice Department for ""zealous"" enforcement of laws aimed at American corporate bribery of foreign officials. The paper concluded their actions were ""causing lasting harm to the competitiveness of U.S. regulated companies and the U.S. capital markets.""
Mr. Clayton's background contrasts with that of current Chairman Mary Jo White, a former prosecutor who
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 43 of 1177

presided over the SEC in a period when the agency collected record amounts of penalties and disgorged profits from wrongdoers.
Many Republicans liked Ms. White personally but thought her agency's fines punished shareholders. Mr. Clayton also will be pressed by congressional Republicans to pare back red tape that affects fundraising, chief executives' compensation and other activities.
""That he is a deal maker rather than a prosecutor... sends a signal to the market of the new administration's intended approach,"" David Goldschmidt, a senior partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &Flom, said in an email.
""Jay Clayton is a highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law,"" Mr. Trump said Wednesday in an announcement of the choice, ""and he will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time.""
""We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers,"" Mr. Trump added, telescoping changes he expects from the agency's new leadership.
Mr. Clayton's background is a throwback to past SEC chairmen who were named before the financial crisis and came directly from Wall Street, such as Bill Clinton-appointee Arthur Levitt or William Donaldson, who served under George W. Bush.
Mr. Clayton's resume quickly attracted opposition from Senate Democrats, who have noted that Mr. Trump's tough criticism of Goldman Sachs and other banks during his campaign seems to have melted away.
""It's hard to see how an attorney who's spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep President-elect Trump's promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from 'getting away with murder,' "" Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) said in a statement, alluding to one of Mr. Trump's populist campaign-trail pledges. ""I look forward to hearing how Mr. Clayton will protect retirees and savers from being exploited, demand real accountability from the financial institutions the SEC oversees, and work to prevent another financial crisis,"" he added. Mr. Brown is the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, which will consider the Clayton nomination.
Mr. Clayton would become the latest Trump appointee with strong ties to Goldman Sachs, joining former Goldman executive Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump's choice for Treasury secretary, and former Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn, who will run the National Economic Council.
Mr. Clayton represented Goldman when it received a $5 billion investment from billionaire Warren Buffett's company during the peak of the credit crisis in September 2008, according to his biography on Sullivan &Cromwell's website. He has also represented Goldman in connection with other investments and acquisitions, according to the law firm. Sullivan &Cromwell is a key outside legal adviser to Goldman and is more closely associated with Wall Street than perhaps any other law firm, though Mr. Clayton's focus has largely been around capital markets.
His past legal work also raises potential conflicts of interest. Mr. Clayton could be forced by government ethics rules to recuse himself from SEC matters that specifically affect his lengthy roster of past clients. Ms. White was hampered by similar constraints during her first years in office, related to clients she served at her New York law firm following her time as a prosecutor as well as firms her husband represented in his legal career.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 44 of 1177

Unlike some of its competitors, Sullivan &Cromwell doesn't have a reputation for feeding the SEC's revolving door. More of its alumni land in corporate roles than in top government jobs.
Mr. Clayton is a lifer at Sullivan &Cromwell, which he joined as an associate after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1993, where he was a competitive rugby and soccer player, according to a classmate, Mark Greene, now the head of the corporate department at Cravath, Swaine &Moore LLP.
Softspoken and low-key, Mr. Clayton is also an avid golfer, a member of several exclusive clubs including Philadelphia Cricket Club and the Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield, N.J.
His colleagues refer to him as a ""generalist"" who has worked on everything from the largest initial public offering of a technology company to ""Hail Mary"" deals to keep firms afloat during the financial crisis, when he came close to working 24-7 for weeks on end.
Mr. Clayton's clients included many firms that struggled through the financial crisis, including Ally Financial Inc. The auto lender, previously part of General Motors Co., sold several overseas assets to repay the U.S. government, which injected $17.2 billion into Ally as part of the bailout of the auto industry.
Mr. Clayton also played a key role in other crisis-era matters related to Bear Stearns's sale to J.P. Morgan Chase &Co., Wachovia Corp.'s sale to Wells Fargo &Co. and troubles facing Lehman Brothers.
""Jay demonstrated time and time again during the various episodes of the financial crisis: he has an extraordinary ability both to create consensus and to make the hard decisions when they need to be made,"" said H. Rodgin Cohen, Sullivan &Cromwell's senior chairman who has worked with him for years.

Dimon to Hollande: You Want More Banks in France? Loosen Labor Laws
By Noemie Bisserbe and William Horobin in Paris and Max Colchester in London
PARIS--French President Franc?ois Hollande met with J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. Chief Executive James Dimon in late October and asked how France could lure finance jobs away from London after Brexit.
Mr. Dimon's message was blunt: The chances that banks would move more employees to France were slim unless the country softens its strict labor laws.
Mr. Hollande--who had yet to announce he wasn't seeking re-election--reassured Mr. Dimon that change would come. But it would happen under his successor, he said.
""We understand,"" Mr. Hollande said, according to people familiar with the matter. ""It's complicated.""
The exchange at the E?lyse?e Palace illustrates the minefield Europe's political establishment is navigating as it seeks to capitalize on the U.K.'s June vote to leave the European Union. Cities across the continent are jockeying to lure jobs away from London, Europe's financial center. But with elections on the horizon in France, Germany and the Netherlands--and populist parties like Marine Le Pen's National Front gaining in the polls--governments are

afraid to publicly court big banks with promises of favorable treatment.
Instead, Paris and other capitals have embarked on a round of quiet diplomacy with the financial industry to provide assurances that--whatever the results of this year's elections--the world's biggest banks can begin relocating their businesses from London.
In France, for example, Mr. Hollande's government has tapped Christian Noyer, former governor of the Bank of France, to act as a bridge to the next administration in negotiating and implementing new incentives to entice banks, according to people familiar with the matter.
Franc?ois Fillon, the conservative Les Re?publicains party's candidate to replace Mr. Hollande in the May presidential elections, has also met with banks to discuss their proposals, according to people familiar with the matter. On the campaign trail, Mr. Fillon has been a staunch critic of France's job protections.
Representatives of the French president's office and Mr. Fillon declined to comment. A spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan declined to comment.
Banks can't wait around. Brexit negotiations are due to start early this year, and executives have begun drawing up detailed plans that can be executed quickly if it looks as if the U.K. won't secure access to the EU's financial markets.
Competition is heating up, and even scooping up a few thousand jobs would have an outsize effect on cities like Paris, Frankfurt or Dublin, whose financial centers are a fraction the size of London's. Their hand is strengthened by incoming rules that may force big non-EU banks to set up subsidiaries and hold extra capital if they want to be based in the trading bloc. This could force big lenders to set up substantial operations in the EU to service clients there regardless of what Brexit deal the U.K. strikes.
Meanwhile, uncertainty over the U.K. government's negotiating position has weakened the U.K.'s ability to entice banks to stay put, Andrew Bailey, a senior British finance regulator, recently told British lawmakers.
So far banks have largely concentrated on scaling up where they already have some operations. HSBC Holdings PLC has said it is focusing on Paris, where it already has a retail presence. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. officials say the bank is scoping out Frankfurt, where it has a banking license, and Citigroup Inc. is exploring moving several hundred jobs from London to Dublin if the U.K. loses access to the single European market, according to people familiar with the matter.
The political climate in France, however, is a stark example of the hurdles facing banks and the political establishment. Bankers in London worry Ms. Le Pen, an anti-immigrant euroskeptic, could win the French presidential election this year.
Mr. Hollande, a Socialist who once branded finance as his ""true adversary,"" knows the national labor code is contentious in France. Before the Brexit vote, the French leader tried to overhaul the labor system but was forced to water down the measures in the face of massive street protests.
In the wake of the Brexit vote, Mr. Hollande's finance minister, Michel Sapin, has rejected any talk of relaxing labor laws for banks, telling a conference on Oct. 27 that the government refused to create a ""special status for finance.""

Behind the scenes, however, French officials are looking at ways to accommodate lenders. Since mid-September, senior executives from banks in the U.S., Asia and the Persian Gulf have held confidential talks with French government officials about relocating some businesses after Brexit, according to the people familiar with the matter.
During the meetings, U.S. banking executives shared their concerns about the country's strict labor laws, which would make it hard for them to hire and fire high-paid bankers and traders, according to these people.
One option, a French official said, would involve allowing banks to easily fire employees that fall into certain European Banking Authority classifications.

Republican Lawmakers Revive 'Audit the Fed' Legislation By Harriet Torry
WASHINGTON--Congressional Republicans on Wednesday revived bills to subject the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions to greater public scrutiny, proposals that didn't get far in recent years but could face brighter prospects under the incoming Trump administration.
Fed officials meet several times a year to decide what to do with short-term interest rates and how to influence them--actions that affect the borrowing costs of households, businesses and investors across the country. The ""Audit the Fed"" measures would require the Government Accountability Office to examine those decisions. The Fed's financial statements are already audited, and the GAO can examine most other Fed operations, but Congress has long exempted monetary policy decisions from such scrutiny.
Supporters of the bills say the public deserves more information on how the central bank makes these decisions. Opponents, including Fed officials, warn it could subject policy makers to political pressure that could hurt the economy.
Rep. Thomas Massie (R., Ky.) introduced an ""Audit the Fed"" bill in the House on Wednesday, and Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) introduced companion legislation in the U.S. Senate.
""Behind closed doors, the Fed crafts monetary policy that will continue to devalue our currency, slow economic growth, and make life harder for the poor and middle class,"" Mr. Massie said in a statement.
The House passed similar legislation last year, but a Senate bill on the issue was blocked in the Senate. Proponents hope the new measures will garner more votes after President-elect Donald Trump takes office, since he expressed support last year--via Twitter--for auditing the central bank.
Mr. Paul's father, former Rep. Ron Paul, had pushed a version of the legislation for years before his son joined the Senate. The idea has gained support in recent years among Republicans wary of the Fed's actions during the financial crisis and its large role in the economy.

Mr. Trump's election could pave the way for a variety of other proposals to overhaul the way the Fed works. Although he hasn't taken positions on every bill, he is viewed as more open to signing such legislation than President Barack Obama, whose administration opposed them.
Finra's 2017 Priorities: Monitoring High-Risk Brokers and Protecting Seniors By Lisa Beilfuss
Wall Street's self-regulator said efforts to monitor high-risk brokers and protect seniors would be priorities this year, consistent with recent years' agendas.
In outlining its annual regulatory and examination priorities, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said Wednesday that it also would remain focused on core issues of compliance, supervision and risk management.
Chief Executive Robert Cook, who took the helm in August, said he continues to meet with member firms, investor groups and regulators and expects to share more information in the coming months ""about some concrete steps...to take a fresh look at certain aspects of Finra's programs and operations.""
High-risk brokers who repeatedly violate regulations top Finra's 2017 agenda. Firms that hire or seek to hire such brokers, the regulator said, ""can expect rigorous regulatory attention"" in terms of firms' due diligence on prospective hires and the supervision of high-risk registered representatives.
Brokers who have violated industry rules can benefit from the fragmented landscape that governs investment advice in the U.S. Brokers, required to give only ""suitable"" investment advice, are overseen by Finra. Investment advisers, held to a fiduciary standard whereby they must put clients' interests first, are overseen by state regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
""It's good to see they're focused on these bad brokers,"" said Ross Intelisano, a partner at law firm Rich, Intelisano &Katz LLP who has represented investors in disputes with financial firms. ""We're seeing a lot more of that,"" he said, referring to brokers with repeated allegations of misdeeds.
Finra said it continues to see instances where firms recommend products that are unsuitable for customers. The regulator said it remains particularly concerned with suitability when it comes to elderly investors, citing ""numerous cases where registered representatives have recommended that senior investors purchase speculative or complex products in search of yield.""
Firms can take a number of steps to protect seniors from exploitation, Finra said, including by contacting elderly customers who place a place orders for penny stocks and questioning certain instructions to transfer funds.
Among particular areas of focus when it comes to suitability: excessive and short-term trading of long-term products, such as variable annuities and unit investment trusts, and brokers' outside business activities or ""selling away"" from their firm. Mr. Intelisano said focusing on outside business activities is one way to increase protection over senior investors, as the elderly tend to be targeted by advisers selling products that aren't actually backed by his or her firm.
""It's just hard to know,"" said Mr. Intelisano, when it comes to monitoring brokers' interactions with seniors. ""The best way to do that is to keep brokers with prior issues outside of the industry.""
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 48 of 1177

A spokesman for Finra also highlighted the self-regulator's commitment to report more about what it is seeing in its examination process. Finra said it will this year begin publishing summary reports that outline key findings from examinations in selected areas, meant to alert firms to what Finra is seeing from a national perspective. Such reports, Finra said, will serve as an additional tool firms can use to strengthen internal controls.
America's Roster of Public Companies Is Shrinking Before Our Eyes By Maureen Farrell
Executives at LoanCore Capital LLC were plotting an initial public offering in 2015 for a portfolio company that manages commercial real-estate credit. Just before the IPO was to launch, the stock market fell sharply. LoanCore pulled the plug.
It hardly mattered. There was plenty of money elsewhere. Last March, LoanCore raised $1 billion from two sovereign-wealth funds. The company expects to continue to raise money from these investors, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Singapore's GIC, according to people familiar with the matter.
LoanCore is emblematic of a new generation of companies that have shunned public markets. With interest rates hovering near record lows, big investment funds seeking higher returns are showering private companies with cash. Companies also are leaving the stock market in near-record numbers through mergers and acquisitions.
The U.S. is becoming ""de-equitized,"" putting some of the best investing prospects out of the reach of ordinary Americans. The stock market once offered a way for average investors to buy into the fastest-growing companies, helping spread the nation's wealth. Since the financial crisis, the equity market has become bifurcated, with a private option available to select investors and a public one that is more of a last resort for companies.
The number of U.S.-listed companies has declined by more than 3,000 since peaking at 9,113 in 1997, according to the University of Chicago's Center for Research in Security Prices. As of June, there were 5,734 such public companies, little more than in 1982, when the economy was less than half its current size. Meanwhile, the average public company's valuation has ballooned.
In the technology industry, the private fundraising market now dwarfs its public counterpart. There were just 26 U.S.-listed technology IPOs last year, raising $4.3 billion, according to Dealogic. Meanwhile, private U.S. tech companies tapped the late-stage funding market 809 times last year, raising $19 billion, Dow Jones VentureSource's data show.
Private funding markets have taken on attributes of public equity, such as an ability to hand employees shares they can trade. Airbnb Inc.'s recent $850 million funding round, which valued the home-rental company at $30 billion, enabled employees to sell $200 million of stock. Investors, particularly in late-stage funding rounds, now often have a better view of a private company's financials than they used to, including through quarterly conference calls.
""There's no great advantage of being public,"" says Jerry Davis, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business and author of ""The Vanishing American Corporation."" ""The dangers of being a public company are really evident.""
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 49 of 1177

Among them, Mr. Davis and others say: having an investor base that clamors for short-term stock gains and being forced to disclose information that could be useful to competitors.
Company departures from public markets have left fund managers with fewer investment options. Their eagerness for more IPOs is evident in the extreme volatility of the few technology companies that made their debuts last year, investors say. Shares of Twilio Inc., Nutanix Inc. and other tech companies that made debuts last year surged well beyond their private-market values, and while most remain above those levels, many pulled back sharply from their post-IPO highs.
Brad Slingerlend, who invests almost exclusively in public companies as a portfolio manager at the Janus Global Technology Fund, often meets with entrepreneurs and seeks to convince them public markets could be their most inexpensive source of capital, while also trying to ease their concerns about listing. ""There's a lot of talk that the stock market is full of big scary monsters that will kill your business,"" he says.
Lance Crosby founded cloud-computing company SoftLayer Technologies Inc. and built it to go public, then changed his mind and sold it to International Business Machines Corp. for roughly $2 billion in 2013. ""I thought the public markets were too harsh on companies that were creating something that doesn't exist,"" he says, citing the then-nascent cloud-computing industry. ""It's tough to answer every quarter for something when you don't have all the answers because it's still unfolding.""
In 2015 he started cybersecurity-software company StackPath, raising about $180 million in private funding. He says he once again will plan for a public offering, but remains doubtful it will be the right path. ""I want to change the world to fix security, and I'm not sure that's possible as a public company,"" he says.
Matthew Prince says in the next few years he plans to list shares of his web-security company, CloudFlare. He has mixed feelings. He says the regular financial updates he currently gives employees help them better understand how their actions affect the company. He worries U.S. securities regulations for public companies would force him to scale back such communication outside of quarterly financial reports to investors. But he also wants his investors and employees to be able to sell shares with ease, which the public market allows.
While it is difficult to quantify, there has been an explosion in private investment capital in recent years. Sovereign- wealth funds--pools of capital invested by nations--have roughly $7.4 trillion under management, more than double the $3.5 trillion they held in 2007, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, a research and data firm. Assets under management at U.S. private-equity firms totaled $1.4 trillion, an increase of more than 30% since 2007 and nearly four times the tally in 2000, according to the most recent data from PitchBook, a data provider and research unit of Morningstar Inc.
Last year, 111 companies went public on U.S. exchanges, raising $24.2 billion, a dollar-volume drop of 33% from the previous year and the lowest dollar volume since 2003, according to Dealogic. The slowdown has confounded market watchers because it comes at a time when stocks are near all-time highs and M&A volume, which typically moves in tandem with IPO activity, was one of the highest years on record.
Since 2009, the number of U.S.-listed IPOs has hovered at fewer than 200 a year, on a 10-year rolling average, well below what it was in the previous decade, according to Dealogic data. Meanwhile, M&A activity targeting U.S. listed companies has risen since 2012 to more than 9,300 transactions a year, on a 10-year rolling average. Before 2012, the average ranged from 8,000 to 9,200.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 50 of 1177

With fewer places for investors to spread their cash and more companies combining, the average size of a public company in the U.S. has swelled, hitting an all-time high of $4.7 billion in 2014 before dropping slightly through the first half of 2016, according to University of Chicago data. The average public company is more than three times as large as it was in 1997, after adjusting for inflation. The inflation-adjusted total capitalization of the U.S. public market has been hovering near its peak.
""We have to match the concentration of the market over time, so we are concentrated in fewer names,"" Janus's Mr. Slingerlend says.
Some investors question whether the private markets will maintain strength over the long haul and whether a pullback could bring more companies back to public ownership.
Venture-capitalist Bill Gurley sees a bubble in the private markets. He predicts investors will lose significant amounts in many closely held companies valued at $1 billion or more, which currently stand at 154, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. ""History would suggest that it's a real possibility,"" he says.
For now, there are few signs of such a pullback. In October, Japanese internet and telecommunications giant SoftBank Group Corp. and Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund announced plans to together invest as much as $100 billion over the next five years in the technology industry, with some of it expected to go into private companies and other money to fund buyouts of public ones. That sum is nearly as much as all venture-capital firms raised since the beginning of 2014, according to PitchBook.
Retail investors haven't had access to shares of some of the highest-value private companies, including Uber Technologies Inc., Airbnb and Snap Inc. Some of those shares have gone to clients of the wealth-management arms of large banks, typically wealthy individuals or families.
If those private companies enter the public markets in coming years as expected, average investors may miss much of the kind of rapid growth achieved by nascent public companies a decade or two ago. Amazon.com Inc., which went public in 1994 valued at $440 million, is now worth about $358 billion.
Morgan Stanley's head of private-capital markets, Ted Tobiason, says private money allows companies to enter public markets healthier. ""Certain things like volatility in the business can be better handled in the private market,"" he says.
Ex-Barclays Forex Trader Pleads Guilty in Long-Running U.S. Probe
By Aruna Viswanatha
WASHINGTON--A former foreign-exchange trader at Barclays PLC pleaded guilty Wednesday to conspiring to manipulate currency rates, the first individual publicly charged in an investigation over collusion at top global banks to move the rates.
Jason Katz, who worked on the New York foreign-exchange desk at Barclays and two other banks, admitted to working between 2007 and 2013 with dealers at other institutions to fix prices for currencies in central and eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, the Justice Department said.
A lawyer for Mr. Katz couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 51 of 1177

The efforts included coordinating bids and offers, and agreeing to quote certain prices to specific customers, the agency said.
Five banks including Barclays pleaded guilty in May 2015 and paid $5.6 billion in penalties to resolve investigations into whether the banks worked together to manipulate foreign currency prices.
In a separate case that grew out of the investigations, prosecutors in July charged two HSBC Holdings PLC employees with fraudulently front-running a $3.5 billion currency trade for a client. The HSBC traders have pleaded not guilty.
According to a plea agreement entered in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday, Mr. Katz agreed to cooperate in the ongoing investigation. He faces up to 10 years in prison.
The Federal Reserve separately on Wednesday announced it permanently prohibited Mr. Katz from working in the banking industry.

HSBC,"Europe's Businesses, Consumers Face 2017 With Optimism; Economic Sentiment Indicator in December was at its highest since March 2011"," Jan 6, 2017",1,"Businesses and consumers across the eurozone were more upbeat about their prospects at the end of 2016 than at any time since early 2011, an indication that they are as yet untroubled by the prospect of setbacks for establishment political parties as key votes loom in 2017 .
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 57 of 1177
The pickup in sentiment, according to a monthly survey by the European Commission, adds to other signs that the eurozone economy gained some momentum in the final quarter of last year. But economists and policy makers worry that heightened uncertainty about the outcome of a series of elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany could lead businesses and households to hold back on spending, thereby weakening
an already modest recovery .
The U.K.'s surprise vote to leave the European Union in June, and Donald Trump's unexpected win in November's presidential election have opened up the possibility of further upsets.
""Although the polls at the end of 2016 suggested the mainstream candidates would eventually prevail in the raft of upcoming elections, no one is putting much faith in them after the U.K.'s EU referendum and U.S. election results,"" economists at HSBC wrote in a research note.
Victory for one or a number of nationalist parties in coming elections could once again raise questions about the survival of the eurozone in its current form, since they are hostile to the single currency.
However, the survey issued by the EU's executive arm on Friday detected little sign of anxiety in December. Its Economic Sentiment Indicator, which aggregates business and consumer confidence, rose to 107.8 from 106.6 in November, reaching its highest level since March 2011.
The national measures for the Netherlands, Germany and France all rose, each to highs last seen more than five years ago.
""This suggests that for now at least, businesses and consumers are brushing off the political uncertainties that face the eurozone in 2017,"" said Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight.
However, there were signs that the rise in optimism might not translate into significantly higher spending by consumers. Figures also released Friday by the EU's statistics agency showed retail sales fell 0.4% in November from the previous month. The decline was a surprise, since economists surveyed last week by The Wall Street Journal estimated sales rose 0.6%.
Sentiment may have been supported by a Dec. 8 decision by the European Central Bank to extend its flagship bond-buying program to the end of 2017 from a tentative termination date in March.
Friday's releases add to other recent indications that eurozone economic growth picked up in the final months of 2016. A December survey of manufacturers and service providers issued Wednesday recorded the fastest growth in activity since May 2011, and economists estimate that gross domestic product increased by either 0.4% or 0.5% in the fourth quarter, having expanded by 0.3% in the previous two periods.
The survey of consumers and businesses was taken before a Dec. 20 terror attack in Berlin, Germany's deadliest in decades. That may affect sentiment in the January survey, but previous experience suggests any blow to morale will prove short-lived. The ESI dipped in August following a July 14 terror attack in France that claimed 86 lives, but rallied in subsequent months.
Outside the eurozone, sentiment also continued to pick up. The U.K.'s national ESI rose to 108.6 from 107.3, its highest level since December 2015 and therefore above the level recorded just before the Brexit vote. Policy

""It's necessary if we want to be attractive,"" the official said. Inti Landauro contributed to this article.

HSBC,"India Expects Growth to Slow to 7.1%; Forecast doesn't include full impact of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cash ban, analysts say"," Jan 6, 2017",0,"[...]the growth estimate wasn't calculated using data from after the cash invalidation on corporations' earnings, industrial output, government spending and others. According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, the number of new investment projects announced in the final quarter of 2016 was the lowest in more than a decade.
FULL TEXT
KOLKATA--India said its economic expansion could slow to 7.1% in the year ending March 31 from 7.6% a year earlier, though analysts warned that this estimate probably doesn't reflect the full impact of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's move in November to cancel almost 90% of the country's cash .
The projection for gross domestic product was released a month earlier than usual to accommodate the government's decision to bring forward the annual budget announcement to Feb. 1.
As a result, the growth estimate wasn't calculated using data from after the cash invalidation on corporations' earnings, industrial output, government spending and others. Those won't be available to statisticians until later.

Friday's number should therefore be read ""with extreme caution,"" said Anubhuti Sahay, head of India research at Standard Chartered PLC.
The Central Statistics Office is scheduled to release another, more-complete forecast of annual GDP on Feb. 28. But even that estimate might not fully capture the effect of the cash crunch on India's vast and hard-to-measure informal economy.
""Much of the data for the post-demonetization [period] is yet to come,"" said G.C. Manna, director-general of the Central Statistics Office. By the time the next estimate is released, he said, the effect of the cash ban ""will be clearer.""
Friday's GDP estimate represents the first official data covering the full breadth of the economy to be released since Mr. Modi abruptly voided all 500- and 1,000-rupee notes ($7.40 and $14.70) in November to drill out cash piles held by tax cheats and bribe-taking bureaucrats. But signs had been pointing to a sharp slowdown.
Factory activity shrank in December for the first time in a year, according to the Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index. Nearly all of the country's car and motorcycle makers reported a year-over-year decline in shipments for the same month.
According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, the number of new investment projects announced in the final quarter of 2016 was the lowest in more than a decade.
Many economists have cut their growth forecasts for the year ending March 31 to between 6.5% and 7%, down a percentage point or more from before November.
In a New Year's Eve address, Mr. Modi defended the cash cancellation, lauding the sacrifices citizens had made for the sake of punishing the corrupt. ""Indians have, with firm resolve and infinite patience, faced difficulties with a smile,"" the prime minister said. ""They have shown how much even people trapped in poverty are willing to do to build a glorious India.""
Yet with banks still struggling in many places to keep branches and ATMs stocked with replacement cash despite strict limits on withdrawals, the difficulties may not prove so temporary.
Sanchit Munjal's footwear company in Agra, Srijati Shoes Pvt. Ltd., has seen demand fall by 20% since November, with smaller towns and cities seeing the largest drops in sales. He expects to keep his production throttled back for at least another six months.
""Until and unless cash reaches the common man for small purchases, things aren't going to be normal,"" Mr. Munjal said. ""You don't call it normal when you see someone crying in the hospital because whatever cash he has, he can't change it at the bank or use it to treat his sick kid.""
Pushcart produce vendors say they have had to cut prices to accommodate their customers' attenuated purchasing power. Making change can also be tough.
""What can we do if a person comes with a 2,000-rupee note?"" asked Daleep Kumar, a vegetable seller in New Delhi, referring to one of the newly issued bills, worth almost $30. ""We can't give away all our lower-denomination notes for small purchases. We refuse to sell at times.""

The shortage of timely official data on vendors such as Mr. Kumar, tiny workshops and others in the informal economy ""has been an issue of concern in India for a long time,"" said Madhavi Arora, an economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank in Mumbai.
Government statisticians in India survey small-scale businesses in detail only every couple of years. In between, for purposes of estimating GDP, they assume that the informal economy grows at roughly the same pace as the formal one, as measured by indicators such as sales-tax collections and corporate revenue. India's current GDP numbers use a survey of informal businesses completed in 2011.
""At this point, we're all working with patchy data,"" said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC. ""It's difficult to tell what the exact drag on the economy has been. I don't think we'll have a grip on that for a while.""

HSBC,Indonesia Plans New Rules for Market Reports After J.P. Morgan Downgrade; Finance officials say they will look at stricter rules for banks that act as primary dealers for government bonds," Jan 8, 2017",1,"JAKARTA, Indonesia--Indonesia is planning stricter rules for market reports written by banks acting as primary dealers for government bonds, days after severing ties with J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. over what officials here said was a faulty equities downgrade.
Talk of such a move is highlighting the potential conflicts banks face in Southeast Asia's largest economy as they try to provide unbiased research to investors and banking services to clients they evaluate.
Finance Ministry officials told The Wall Street Journal on Saturday that they could begin discussing new policies on Monday for the 19 financial institutions that act as primary dealers in Indonesia's regular government domestic bond auctions. The ministry appoints banks and securities firms as primary dealers to buy government bonds in auctions and then resell them in the secondary market.
""Our goal is to ensure that banks don't release unnecessary reports that could destabilize the market, and that they differentiate between reports for internal circulation and those for public consumption,"" said Schneider Siahaan, director of debt portfolio and strategy for the ministry.
""Basically, it is about how to minimize the negative tone, how to minimize negative repercussions,"" he added.
Robert Pakpahan, director general of budget financing and risk management, said the ministry wasn't considering banning market research reports. He added that it was too early to speculate on the final nature of a change in policy, given that no formal meetings on the matter have taken place.
The discussions stem from a Nov. 13 report about the global repercussions of Donald Trump's election victory in the U.S., in which J.P. Morgan downgraded its rating on Indonesian equities to underweight from overweight, saying that a rise in bond-market volatility ""increases emerging-market risk premiums."" The largest U.S. bank by assets also made smaller downgrades to Brazilian and Turkish equities.
Indonesian finance officials said in recent days that the research lacked credibility and could destabilize the country's financial system. The government has cut its business partnerships with J.P. Morgan, including removing the bank from a list of primary dealers for government bond auctions.
An economist at a local primary dealer said J.P. Morgan had been the only primary dealer to issue such a downgrade during a volatile time for emerging markets after Mr. Trump's election.
In the banking world, securities analysts are supposed to provide independent, unvarnished investment advice to their commission-paying clients, but a negative word can alienate clients on the other side--the stock and bond issuers that pay banks large fees to help them raise capital.

or government officials, and lose them business from the offended issuers.
""It will make banks cautious"" in Indonesia, said Kay Van-Petersen, global macro strategist at Saxo Bank in Singapore. ""The research side is hard to justify. The big business is from the underwriting and getting the fees.''
He said any move wouldn't necessarily affect investor interest in Indonesia, where a $900 billion economy for years has posted growth of around 5% or better. Emerging-market investors ""are used to that kind of stuff,"" he said.
Major foreign primary dealers in Indonesia, including Citibank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Standard Chartered, declined to comment.
J.P. Morgan has said that it is working toward a resolution with the Finance Ministry. The bank said its business in Indonesia continues to operate as usual and that the effect on clients is minimal.
Still, being a primary dealer is an important part of business in a country like Indonesia where foreigners own a significant portion of domestic bonds--almost 40%. That business can be worth tens of millions of dollars to banks annually and opens pathways to even more lucrative business with investors in secondary market trading.
J.P. Morgan is one of the largest foreign banks in Indonesia, and dealt with some of the largest flows from foreign investors into and out of government bonds. For that reason, officials here view the bank's research as especially pivotal to budgetary fundraising, financial analysts say.
A senior official of an Indonesian government financial institution said the government recognized that negative research reports are a fact of life, and that the Finance Ministry's policy response is likely to be measured. ""Analysts can't recommend 'buy' or 'overweight' all the time,"" the official said.

HSBC,Gold Rises as Dollar Loses Strength; The precious metal continues to recover from lows last month," Jan 9, 2017",1,"Gold prices rose Monday, as the precious metal continued to recover from its selloff into the end of last year.
Gold for February delivery settled up 1% at $1,184.90 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
A weaker dollar also helped support gold's gains on Monday, as the U.S. currency reversed course throughout the day. The WSJ Dollar Index was recently down 0.2% at 92.65. Gold is priced in dollars and becomes cheaper to foreign buyers as the dollar weakens.
According to analysts, the safe-haven asset has regained attention as prices have fallen to multi-month lows. James Steel, chief precious metals analyst at HSBC, said the drop in gold prices has helped spark physical demand in emerging markets including China.
""There does appear to be some modest survival in physical demand,"" Mr. Steel said.
Following a long losing streak, gold exchange-traded funds started seeing inflows last week, according to Commerzbank analysts.
However, gold may continue to face challenges from a strong U.S. dollar, interest-rate increases and uncertainty over the political and economic implications of the new Trump administration. Citi analysts wrote Monday that they expect the gold rally to be short-lived, having been driven by investors covering short positions and looking for bargains.
""I largely expect gold prices to be mainly consolidating this week as we await Donald Trump's presidential inauguration, after which we can get a better picture of the policies that he is going to undertake for his term in office,"" said Jonathan Chan, investment analyst at Phillip Futures.

HSBC,Three Ex-Traders Indicted in Currency-Manipulation Case; Justice Department says three former traders rigged prices and bids for euro-dollar exchange rate," Jan 10, 2017",0,"A federal grand jury has indicted three former foreign-exchange traders for allegedly conspiring to manipulate currency rates, the Justice Department said Tuesday, the latest development in a collusion investigation that in 2015 led to five banks pleading guilty to fixing foreign-currency prices.
Richard Usher, a former trader at an affiliate of the Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and a former managing director at an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Chase &Co.; Rohan Ramchandani, a former managing director and trader at an affiliate of Citigroup Inc.; and Christopher Ashton, a former trader at an affiliate of Barclays PLC, were charged with conspiracy in an effort to fix prices and rig bids for the euro-U.S. dollar rate.
On Tuesday, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said it had taken steps against Messrs. Usher and Ramchandani to prohibit them from banking and fine them each $5 million.
Attorneys for the three men couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
According to the indictment, the group of traders dubbed themselves ""the Cartel"" or ""the Mafia,"" and exchanged near-daily calls and other messages in which they would discuss ""past, current, and future customer orders and trades; customer names; and risk positions.""
Their alleged conspiracy included colluding around the time of certain benchmark rates and refraining from entering orders or trading at certain times, the indictment says.
""We previously secured criminal convictions of the financial institutions involved in the misconduct. Today we seek to hold accountable the individuals who conspired on their behalf,"" Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Bill Baer said Tuesday.
In May 2015, five banks--including Barclays, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC--pleaded guilty and paid $5.6 billion in penalties to resolve investigations into whether the banks worked together to manipulate foreign currency prices.
Including Tuesday's indictment, the Justice Department has now charged six people in the investigation and a related case.

Last week, a former foreign-exchange trader at Barclays PLC pleaded guilty to conspiring to manipulate currency rates, admitting he worked with dealers at other institutions to fix prices for currencies in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
And in July of last year, in a case that grew out of the investigations, prosecutors charged two foreign-exchange executives at HSBC Holdings PLC with fraudulently front-running a $3.5 billion currency trade for a client. The HSBC traders have pleaded not guilty.

HSBC,"Brexitology: Divining Britain's Plan to Leave the EU; Prime Minister Theresa May's comments can send analysts scrambling, markets spiraling"," Jan 11, 2017",0,"LONDON--Britain's impending departure from the European Union has spawned a cottage industry of Brexitologists.
Investors, securities analysts, political-risk consultants and politicians, intent on divining the British government's Brexit plans , have been scrutinizing the public utterances of Prime Minister Theresa May and her top aides for clues. Perceived shifts in tone or substance--or the lack of them--from senior officials have sent observers scrambling to recalibrate forecasts as markets gyrate.
""People are grasping at straws,"" said John Wraith, a U.K. economist at UBS, charged with predicting the likely
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 77 of 1177
course of Brexit negotiations and their potential impact on the British economy. ""I can't think of anything where we've been in the dark for as long as we are, and where the consequences are so material.""
Market reactions have been sudden and sharp. On Monday, the British pound fell more than 1% against the dollar as traders reacted to a Sunday television interview with the prime minister they read as a sign she would pursue a clear break with the EU. Mrs. May told Sky News, ""Often people talk in terms as if somehow we are leaving the EU, but we still want to kind of keep bits of membership of the EU."" She added: ""We are leaving. We are coming out.""
Her words didn't mark much of a departure from past statements, but investors who see advantages if the U.K. stays within the common market had anticipated a softer stance.
Lawmakers in both major political parties have called on Mrs. May to reveal more detail, and, in a resignation email to colleagues last week, the country's departing ambassador to the EU said civil servants don't know the government's goals .
In the absence of a detailed blueprint, ""every single inflection, every single difference from the formula she employed in a previous interview is blown out of all proportion,"" said Tim Bale, a politics professor at Queen Mary University in London.
The British leader has said she doesn't want to compromise Britain's chances in negotiations by showing all her cards at the onset. But under pressure, she has pledged to offer more details in a speech in coming weeks.
She has said she wants a deal that will address voter concerns about immigration as well as of British businesses that need access to Europe's trading market. That could be difficult. The EU says such access must be accompanied by free movement of labor. EU leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have said they won't let the U.K. cherry pick what it wants.
After Mrs. May reiterated her stance on Monday, both sides interpreted her comments as a sign of support.
Richard Tice, co-chair of the pro-Brexit group Leave Means Leave, said he took Mrs. May's words to mean the U.K. is leaving the EU's common market. ""We're very comfortable with the direction of travel as to where the government is likely to end up,"" Mr. Tice said.
Anna Soubry, a Conservative lawmaker who supports staying in the single market, said she was encouraged that Mrs. May wants a new deal with the EU that puts the economy at its heart.
""She has surely noticed the dreadful reaction from the markets each time the government hints that it will aim to leave the single market,"" Mrs. Soubry said.
Sterling on Wednesday morning continued its slide against the dollar. In October, sterling dropped against the dollar after Mrs. May said she would begin Brexit talks by the end of March. Later that month, it moved up after a government lawyer said that any final agreement between the EU and Britain would likely need to be ratified by Parliament.
In December, the pound rose after Britain's Brexit minister David Davis said the U.K. would consider making payments to the EU's budget to secure the best-possible trade access.

Dominic Bunning, currency strategist at HSBC Holdings PLC said he's paying more attention to politics than he would normally as an economist, given the lack of clarity.
""There is a lot more noise and a lot less actual signal,"" Mr. Bunning said. ""Knowing which one to follow is a lot harder.""
The British press, meanwhile, has pounced on any inkling. When a photographer caught an aide to a Conservative lawmaker leaving the country's Department for Exiting the European Union in November with densely scrawled notes tucked under her arm, it was front-page news. Visible in close-up were the words ""What's the model? Have cake &eat it.""
Foreign Minister Boris Johnson used the phrase when he was campaigning for Brexit to refer to Britain having both control over immigration and free trade with the EU. But the government said the notes didn't reflect its position, pointing out they didn't belong to a government official or adviser.
Earlier that month, a memo from Deloitte LLP saying the government didn't have a coherent plan was published in the Times of London. Deloitte apologized, saying it was for internal use and wasn't commissioned by the government.

Gold for February delivery closed up 0.9% at $1,196.60 a troy ounce, the highest level since November 22, after rebounding from losses earlier in the session.
The gains came after President-elect Donald Trump criticized the drug industry in his first post-election press conference , hitting prices for health-care stocks and other equities.
""Greater than usual market sensitivity to Trump's comments and actions may persist until the market becomes used to him in office,"" said James Steel, an analyst at HSBC, in a note to investors. ""This could take several months.""
Some investors may also have been disappointed that Donald Trump's press conference held few specifics about the his plans to cut taxes and raise infrastructure spending, leading them to sell the dollar and buy the safe haven metal, says Peter Hug, global trading director at Kitco Metals.
""The markets were looking for clarity, and they didn't get it,"" Mr. Hug said.
A weaker dollar buoys gold, which is priced in the U.S. currency and becomes more affordable to foreign investors when the dollar falls. The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of other currencies, was recently down 0.5% at 92.22.
Prices for the metal are up more than 3.9% for the year. However, gold's swing higher hasn't been accompanied by flows of money into exchange-traded funds that buy the metal on behalf of investors seeking long-term exposure to the market, said Simona Gambarini, an analyst at Capital Economics.
""Longer-term investors, the stickier money, is now waiting to see what happens,"" she said.
Analysts at Commerzbank noted a divergent pattern in gold ETFs so far this year. Investors have continued to pull money from the biggest gold ETF, the U.S.-based SPDR Gold Trust, adding to the hefty outflows in the wake of Mr. Trump's election.
Silver for March delivery closed down 0.1% to $16.82 a troy ounce. April platinum was off 0.7% at $976.40 a troy ounce. March palladium was down 1.5% at $753.90 a troy ounce.

HSBC,Regulator Voices Concern Over Privacy When Debts Are Sold Online; Unencrypted personal data found on online marketplaces where debts written off are offered for sale at fraction of face value," Jan 12, 2017",0,"WASHINGTON--The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Wednesday expressed concern about unencrypted personal data found on online marketplaces where debts written off by banks and payday lenders are offered for sale at a fraction of their face value.
The regulator's review , which analyzed nearly 300 portfolios offered on three online marketplaces in 2015, sheds light on practices in a little-known corner of the financial industry. When the original creditors fail to collect debts, they often unload them at a steep discount to realize some return. The debt's new owner has the right to seek to collect the full amount of the debt or to resell it. Some of these debts are sold through small internet marketplaces.
These debt portfolios include sensitive personal information, such as names, Social Security numbers and dates of birth. They also generally include financial information such as an account number, the name of the original creditor, current balance and date of last payment. In some instances, the CFPB said, unencrypted, identifiable personal information was available to any visitor to the marketplaces.
""Handled appropriately, they can efficiently connect responsible debt buyers with responsible debt sellers,"" CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in prepared remarks to be delivered at a debt-collection event in Washington on Thursday. ""But the ease with which debts are bought and sold online raises the risk that debts, and the sensitive information that comes with them, could fall into the hands of irresponsible parties or outright criminals.""
The portfolios examined by the CFPB were advertised as containing the data of more than 1.2 million consumers in
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 83 of 1177
total, with a combined face value of nearly $2 billion in debt. The median asking price per dollar of original debt was less than one cent. The sellers described the debts as originating from creditors such as Citigroup Inc., American Express Co. and HSBC Holdings PLC, according to the CFPB.
The debt-collection industry affects about 70 million Americans who have at least one debt outstanding, according to the CFPB. The bureau, which receives more consumer complaints about debt collection than any other financial product or service, has brought more than 25 enforcement actions against debt collectors since 2011. Last year, it issued an outline of how it plans to regulate the industry in the future.
The CFPB also released on Thursday a survey looking at consumer experiences with debt collectors .
It indicated that one of three consumers reported having been contacted by a debt collector over the past year, and one in four consumers said they felt threatened, even though collectors are generally prohibited by law from harassing, oppressing or abusing consumers. About a third of the respondents said the creditor or collector had contacted them at inconvenient hours, calling between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m.
The bureau sent 10,000 surveys to randomly chosen consumers in a database of borrowers and received more than 2,000 responses.

EU's Capital-Markets Push Faces Hurdle--Euroskepticism
The European Union has been working since 2015 on a plan to unify and boost its capital markets, aiming to juice the bloc's economy. With pivotal elections in France and Germany looming later this year, experts worry that rising nationalism and euroskeptic attitudes could thwart those efforts.
The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, initiated the Capital Markets Union project in a bid to help small businesses thrive. Part of the effort involves reducing the bloc's dependence on traditional bank lending, which European businesses rely on much more than their counterparts in the U.S. Some key proposals include reviving the asset-backed-securities market, relaxing rules for small companies seeking to raise money and taking first steps toward harmonizing insolvency laws across the continent.
With the plan to build a robust capital market, the commission sought to pivot from reactionary measures aimed at safeguarding EU financial services after the 2008 crisis toward proactive ones intended to bolster the economy.
Critics say the project wasn't ambitious enough, in part because it was crafted with an eye toward avoiding objections to excessive EU intervention in national affairs from the U.K., which has since voted to leave the bloc.
""The capital markets union is a good idea, but it didn't start with an analysis looking at what we need to have a unified capital market,"" Sven Giegold, an influential German member of the European Parliament representing the Green Party, said in an interview. ""It started by looking at what could be done without annoying the Brits and signaling a push for greater EU integration.""
Now, even the least controversial parts of the project are falling victim to political haggling.
Easing requirements for a prospectus--the disclosure document a company provides to potential investors--got held up because of protracted negotiations that carried on until the late hours of Dec. 7 during one of the final meetings of 2016. At the time, Kay Swinburne, a British member of the European Parliament working on the initiative, said she felt national governments were getting in the way and raising protectionist barriers.
Given that the prospectus provision is considered the ""low-hanging fruit"" within the entire project and one of the first proposals put forward, the difficulties of pushing it through raise questions about whether more controversial proposals will make it into law.
The prospectus rules are now set to be transcribed into law after an agreement was reached in December among lawmakers, the commission and national governments.
The push to revive asset-backed securities was also caught in the European Parliament until late December as lawmakers fought over the riskiness of securitized paper, which has been blamed for triggering the financial crisis. Lawmakers reached a preliminary negotiating position and must now arrive at a consensus with EU member states.

A series of other measures, aiming to unlock venture-capital funds and to unify disparate insolvency laws , still need to make it through the legislative process, which requires approval from both the European Parliament and national governments. A foray into bankruptcy rules, a traditionally sensitive area in Europe, was a bold step for the commission. How such proposals are handled could well indicate the fate of the entire project.
Mr. Giegold said the lack of political will to drive forward a strong capital markets union stems from a fear of taking on euroskeptics: ""What will happen after the French and German elections--who knows? But we should tackle the main goals and not be afraid of the euroskeptics. Most banks don't love that they have 28 legal regimes.""
Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond
Mnuchin Agrees to Divest Some Holdings, Avoid Decisions on CIT Group By Richard Rubin
WASHINGTON--Steven Mnuchin, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Treasury secretary, won't be able to make decisions involving CIT Group Inc., the financial firm he helped lead, until at least July 2018 and probably longer without special permission, under an ethics agreement released Wednesday.
Mr. Mnuchin also agreed to divest from his holdings in 43 different investments, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and several investment funds he has run. He also will step down from 42 different positions he holds. Some are related to trusts that aren't clearly explained in the disclosures, while others relate to Dune Capital Management, the investment firm he has been running.
Mr. Mnuchin's financial disclosures, also released Wednesday by the Office of Government Ethics, show that his net worth exceeds $150 million and that he holds his wealth through a variety of trusts.
Those holdings include a small airplane and at least a partial interest in a Willem de Kooning painting.
Mr. Mnuchin is a former partner at Goldman Sachs who has financed movies and helped purchase IndyMac Bank after the financial crisis. He has never served in the government and became most publicly involved last year, when he became the finance chairman for Mr. Trump's campaign.
His confirmation hearing hasn't yet been scheduled, and his business ties are likely to be a subject of inquiry during that process. Democrats have already been criticizing his years at OneWest Bank, the successor to IndyMac, and its role in foreclosing on mortgages.
OneWest was later purchased by CIT and Mr. Mnuchin was on CIT's board of directors until December 2016, according to his disclosure. The disclosures released Wednesday show more than $38 million in income from CIT and OneWest.
They also show that Mr. Mnuchin could receive payments from CIT in the future, the result of part of the merger agreement called a holdback. Two of Mr. Mnuchin's trusts are entitled to up to $8 million in payments from CIT starting in 2018, unless the funds are needed to cover ""certain contingent liabilities"" of OneWest, the disclosures said, without describing those liabilities.

As Treasury secretary, Mr. Mnuchin would have influence over policy issues related to CIT, such as whether Congress should pass legislation exempting banks of its size from requirements of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial- overhaul law.
He also would help lead the efforts to revamp the U.S. tax system and manage the country's finances. The country also is approaching its statutory debt limit, and he would have to find a way to address that constraint within his first few months in office.
CFPB Voices Concern Over Privacy When Debts Are Sold Online
By Yuka Hayashi
WASHINGTON--The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Wednesday expressed concern about unencrypted personal data found on online marketplaces where debts written off by banks and payday lenders are offered for sale at a fraction of their face value.
The regulator's review, which analyzed nearly 300 portfolios offered on three online marketplaces in 2015, sheds light on practices in a little-known corner of the financial industry. When the original creditors fail to collect debts, they often unload them at a steep discount to realize some return. The debt's new owner has the right to seek to collect the full amount of the debt or to resell it. Some of these debts are sold through small internet marketplaces.
These debt portfolios include sensitive personal information, such as names, Social Security numbers and dates of birth. They also generally include financial information such as an account number, the name of the original creditor, current balance and date of last payment. In some instances, the CFPB said, unencrypted, identifiable personal information was available to any visitor to the marketplaces.
""Handled appropriately, they can efficiently connect responsible debt buyers with responsible debt sellers,"" CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in prepared remarks to be delivered at a debt-collection event in Washington on Thursday. ""But the ease with which debts are bought and sold online raises the risk that debts, and the sensitive information that comes with them, could fall into the hands of irresponsible parties or outright criminals.""
The portfolios examined by the CFPB were advertised as containing the data of more than 1.2 million consumers in total, with a combined face value of nearly $2 billion in debt. The median asking price per dollar of original debt was less than one cent. The sellers described the debts as originating from creditors such as Citigroup Inc., American Express Co. and HSBC Holdings PLC, according to the CFPB.
The debt-collection industry affects about 70 million Americans who have at least one debt outstanding, according to the CFPB. The bureau, which receives more consumer complaints about debt collection than any other financial product or service, has brought more than 25 enforcement actions against debt collectors since 2011. Last year, it issued an outline of how it plans to regulate the industry in the future.
The CFPB also released on Thursday a survey looking at consumer experiences with debt collectors.
It indicated that one of three consumers reported having been contacted by a debt collector over the past year, and one in four consumers said they felt threatened, even though collectors are generally prohibited by law from harassing, oppressing or abusing consumers. About a third of the respondents said the creditor or collector had contacted them at inconvenient hours, calling between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m.

The bureau sent 10,000 surveys to randomly chosen consumers in a database of borrowers and received more than 2,000 responses.
WSJ Pro: BOE's Carney Calls for Post-Brexit Financial Regulation Deal By Jason Douglas
LONDON--Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney said Wednesday the U.K. and the European Union should endeavor to strike a deal on post-Brexit financial regulation in the interests of preserving financial stability.
Mr. Carney said in testimony to lawmakers that existing ""equivalence"" rules that allow countries with similar financial regulations to sell services to the EU wouldn't be satisfactory for the U.K. after Brexit, as Britain could lose input into how such rules were crafted.
""We don't want to be a rule taker,"" he said in testimony to Parliament's Treasury committee, which scrutinizes economic policy.
Mr. Carney said an aim in negotiations should be to create a formal structure for U.K. and European regulators to agree upon new regulations and to preserve equivalence in financial rules. Without such a deal, there is a risk the U.K. could be handed rules that BOE officials judge would risk undermining financial stability, he said.
The BOE said in November that the biggest risks to the stability of the U.K. financial system emanated from abroad, and Mr. Carney reiterated Wednesday that Brexit probably isn't the gravest threat. The BOE in November flagged concerns over China's economy as well as wider political uncertainty.
Mr. Carney said that a disorderly Brexit could hurt the EU more than the U.K. if it disrupted access to London's capital markets. That underscores the desirability of an interim deal to smooth the path between the close of negotiations over the U.K.'s departure and the implementation of its new relationship with the EU, he said.
""There are greater financial stability risks in the short term on the continent than there are in the U.K.,"" Mr. Carney said.
It is in ""the interest of the U.K and the EU27 that there is an implementation phase, a transition phase, and that this is agreed early on,"" he said, referring to the bloc's 27 member states, excluding the U.K.
EU's Ko?nig Offers Comfort on Italy's Effort to Help Struggling Lender By Julia-Ambra Verlaine
BRUSSELS--Not all bank failures are a threat to financial stability, Single Resolution Board chief Elke Ko?nig said Wednesday in a bid to assuage concerns around Italy's third-largest lender.
Speaking to a group of reporters at the board's headquarters in Brussels, Ms. Ko?nig, who heads the European Union's authority over failing banks, said rules put in place after the Lehman Brothers Holdings bankruptcy have reduced the threat a single bank could pose to financial stability.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 89 of 1177

Her comments come as Italy's Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena struggles with sour loans and has turned to the government for capital to stay afloat.
""Regulatory and technical developments since the 2008 crisis mean that today fewer banks than ever before pose a risk to financial stability in their failure,"" said Ms. Ko?nig, who cited new capital requirements and changes around derivatives trading as examples of rules comprising the EU's banking safety net.
Launched in the wake of the financial crisis to prevent national governments from bailing out their top banks--and leaving taxpayers with the bill--the board has been operating since January 2015. Monte dei Paschi is the first major test of Europe's postcrisis plan for handling a systemically important lender in trouble.
Wednesday marked the agency's second annual press briefing, which Ms. Ko?nig used to clarify rules around Italy's move to inject public money into Monte dei Paschi via a loophole known as ""precautionary recapitalization.""
In December, Italy's parliament approved a [euro]20 billion ($21 billion) support package for the bank, sparking a debate as to whether the money counts as state aid and therefore undermines the board's role.
According to Ms. Ko?nig, it doesn't.
Ms. Ko?nig said ""2016 finished with the spotlights on one member state part of the euro area,"" alluding to Italy. One of the measures allowed in the regulation is precautionary recapitalization, she said. ""This is the only measure where state intervention is not triggering resolution.""
The European Commission, the EU's executive arm and responsible for enforcing the rules, is currently in discussions with the Italian government to work on a restructuring plan and ensure the request doesn't constitute state aid.
""The Italian government has announced that they want to further strengthen its banking sector in compliance with EU law,"" Ms. Ko?nig said. ""And of course this is welcome. The details are yet to be announced.""
WSJ Pro: Italy Assures Germany It Will Adhere to Eurozone Rules on Banking Rescues By Andrea Thomas
BERLIN--Italy's finance minister promised that Rome will comply with eurozone rules during its efforts to help its struggling banking sector, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Scha?uble said Wednesday.
Italian Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan assured Mr. Scha?uble that Italy will stick to the rules ""and I have no reason to doubt this,"" the German finance minister said.
The Italian government plans to rescue lender Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA. European rules forbid bailouts and Europe should stick to its pledge to stay clear of taxpayer bailouts of banks, Mr. Scha?uble said.
He insisted that eurozone countries must ensure that member nations stick to the rules to which they have agreed because otherwise would risk the single-currency bloc's stability.
""We must not forget our own rules,"" Mr. Scha?uble said, adding that any problems aren't a result of the rules but
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 90 of 1177

from the lack of applying the rules.
Berlin and Rome have repeatedly sparred over Italy's attempts to inject capital into its struggling banks without imposing losses to junior bondholders first, losses that would be dictated by recently introduced European bank- resolution rules.
SEC Blesses Negotiable Mutual-Fund Fees
By Jason Zweig
Ever since 1940, mutual-fund commissions have been non-negotiable. That could soon change.
Capital Group Cos. of Los Angeles, which runs $1.4 trillion largely in mutual funds, got approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday for a novel way of selling funds that it calls ""Clean Shares."" The structure would get fund companies out of the business of setting commissions and fees. Instead, brokerage firms would set their own charges.
It works like this. Say you want to put $10,000 into Capital Group's Investment Company of America mutual fund. For decades, its Class A shares have charged 5.75% up front, or $575 on a $10,000 investment -- regardless of which broker sells them to you.
If, instead, you were to buy the new Clean Shares, it would be up to the broker, not the fund company, to determine how much you pay.
The move was prompted largely by the Department of Labor's so-called fiduciary rule, said Matt O'Connor, head of North American distribution at Capital Group. That rule, imposed last year, requires brokers offering individualized advice on retirement accounts to minimize their conflicts of interest. Under the rule, brokers are discouraged from favoring funds that charge higher commissions.
Under the new fee structure, Capital Group would introduce a class of shares equivalent to a no-load fund, carrying no sales commission and no distribution or marketing fees. As a result, a broker selling those shares will collect fees directly from clients rather than from the fund company. And the brokerage firm could assess the same fees on such funds as it would on the exchange-traded funds that have been competing so fiercely for investors' dollars.
""We hope this will be a pivotal moment in moving toward transparency on what investors are paying for advice,"" said Mr. O'Connor.
Robert Plaze, a partner specializing in investment-management law at Stroock &Stroock &Lavan in Washington, said the proposed structure echoes so-called mutual fund supermarkets such as those run by Charles Schwab, where any participating fund is available at the same charge.
""How these shares are priced will be a business decision on the part of the broker, not the fund company,"" said Mr. Plaze. ""The forces of supply and demand will operate on that fee schedule, and that should lead to greater competition.""
For decades, mutual-fund sales charges have remained stubbornly high, often as high as 5.75% today. And
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 91 of 1177

distribution fees have run as high as 1%. Capital Group's initiative is another sign that is changing, said Barry Barbash, a former head of mutual-fund regulation at the SEC who now is a partner at Willkie Farr &Gallagher in Washington.
""In reaction to the Department of Labor rule, the mutual fund industry is redoing the landscape so as not to use distribution fees,"" he said.
WSJ Pro: Fed's Dudley Says More Rules Alone Won't Cure Bank Culture Problems By Katy Burne
Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley said Wednesday that more rules alone wouldn't cure the banking industry's culture failings and that what is missing is more personal accountability and bankers' calling out others' bad conduct.
In remarks at a financial services culture symposium in Manhattan, posted to the New York Fed's website, he said he was disappointed at the scale of recent market-manipulation cases and they laid bare how the lessons of the initial interest-rate rigging scandal weren't properly learned.
""I was particularly struck by how the manipulation of foreign exchange rates occurred even after the Libor fixing was widely known,"" said Mr. Dudley in the speech, referring to the London interbank offered rate that banks were charged with rigging in the years surrounding the financial crisis.
He said the New York Fed started a review of banks' culture problems in the wake of the Libor and foreign exchange manipulation probes. ""The appropriate lessons from the Libor scandal did not seem to have been learned,"" he said, adding, ""That was both surprising and profoundly disappointing to me.""
Banks collectively have paid billions of dollars in fines stemming from those market manipulation probes. Some lawsuits from private investors are pending.
The recent sales scandal at Wells Fargo &Co. is the latest example of bad banking culture, he said. That probe included a $185 million settlement over the bank opening as many as 2.1 million accounts using fictitious or unauthorized customer information, as well as new restrictions on the bank. Former Wells CEO John Stumpf also stepped down.
Mr. Dudley has given a series of speeches on what he sees as a widespread problem in banking culture that drove the sorts of behavior evident in those cases. In those speeches, he lays out how banking is a critical profession and how greater trustworthiness is needed for the public to restore its faith in the industry.
""When each new scandal emerges, the industry is painted with the same broad brush,"" he said. ""This underscores the importance of taking both individual and collective responsibility for reform. You have a personal stake in improving bank culture. Your firms have a stake too. And so does the industry.""
Senators Seek More Information About Wells Fargo's Overdraft Income By Emily Glazer
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 92 of 1177

A group of Democratic senators asked Wells Fargo's chief executive for more details about the bank's recent boost in income from overdraft charges and whether it is related to its sales-practices scandal, according to a letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
Senate Banking Committee Democratic senators led by Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren asked why the San Francisco bank's income from overdraft fees increased at a rate roughly five times higher than its peers as noted in a recent Financial Times article.
""Wells Fargo's overdraft income has increased disproportionately to the rest of the banking industry in the same way that Wells Fargo's cross selling exceeded that of its competition,"" according to the letter. It added that compensation incentives for overdraft services in some cases were structured similarly to those for banking accounts and credit cards.
A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said the bank hasn't made any changes to its practices that would result in more or higher overdraft fees for customers. She added that the bank hasn't had any banker incentive compensation or sales goals related to overdrafts.
The bank paid a $185 million settlement in September for opening as many as 2.1 million accounts using fictitious or unauthorized customer information. It has been in the spotlight for the past four months over its sales tactics and faces a spate of federal and state investigations.
Overdraft protection allows customers to complete a transaction even if they don't have enough money in a checking account. The largest banks charge a fee, typically about $35 per overdrawn debit-card or automated- teller-machine transaction.
The senators, who include Sen. Jack Reed (D., R.I.), Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.) Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.), Sen. Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii) and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D., MD.), also cited reports from The Wall Street Journal that former and current employees detailed improper sales tactics related to overdraft protection services. In October, the article highlighted instances of managers pushing bankers to sign up customers for potentially costly overdraft protection that they didn't always need or realize they were getting.
The Wells Fargo spokeswoman reiterated Wednesday that the bank has adhered to a 2010 regulation that requires customers to opt into overdraft protection. The bank won't charge an overdraft fee on a one-time debit card transaction or ATM withdrawal without specific customer consent, she added.
The senators asked Wells Fargo for a host of information by Feb. 14.
They seek specific information related to overdraft-protection products, including sales goals, amounts of overdraft fees charged to customers and company policies related to overdraft, saying a response to a similar question asked in late September was ""vague and incomplete.""
They also asked for a breakdown from 2007 to present of the monthly income Wells Fargo has received from overdraft fees; customers signed up for overdraft protection without their consent; and employees who received increased pay for meeting sales goals related to overdraft products or those disciplined for not meeting those goals.
The senators, among seven other requests, also asked for information related to policy changes regarding fees,
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 93 of 1177

refund requests or other issues in the last 18 months.
The spokeswoman said the bank made two changes in 2014 to ""reduce overdraft incidents"" but also lowered its overdraft fee income in 2015. From 2015 to 2016, Wells Fargo's total overdraft fee income grew, she said, ""due to a number of factors, including primary customer growth and increased account transaction activity,"" according to the statement.
UniCredit Hit by $8.6 Billion Bad-Loan Charge By GiovannI Legorano
ROME--Italian lender UniCredit SpA said Thursday it will book [euro]8.1 billion ($8.57 billion) in provisions for bad loans, as part of a balance-sheet cleanup it unveiled in December.
The bank said last month it planned to launch a [euro]13 billion rights issue by the end of March--one of the largest Italy has seen--as well as cutting thousands of jobs and selling a large chunk of bad loans.
The move follows a tumultuous year for Italian banks, which have been battered by investor anxiety about the solidity of a sector that struggles with bad loans and low profitability. Italian banking stocks have fallen more than 30% in the past year.
At the end of last year, the Italian government set up a fund to prop up the banking sector, setting the stage for a bailout of Europe's most troubled lender, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA.
In remarks issued before the start of a shareholders assembly called to approve the plan, UniCredit said the measures weren't requested by any supervisory authority. The bank will book the provisions in its fourth-quarter earnings.
In December, the bank said it planned to shed [euro]17.7 billion of gross bad loans by bundling them into securities to be sold to investors.
The bank also said last month it would cut an additional 6,500 jobs by 2019 on top of those already planned, bringing the total reductions to 14,000, or 10% of its workforce.
The redundancies will require the booking of [euro]1.7 billion in costs for the last quarter of 2016, UniCredit said Thursday.
Shares in UniCredit were down 1.2% Thursday morning. Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup

Don't Expect Big Bank Relief Under GOP Plan
Financial stocks have rallied since the election in hopes of a big rollback of postcrisis regulations. But Fitch Ratings issued a report Wednesday titled: ""Regulatory Relief Unlikely for Large U.S. Banks Under CHOICE Act,"" a reference to the bill championed by Texas Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. The report concludes that the trade-off embedded in the bill -- a requirement that big banks maintain more capital to escape some red tape-- would be a net negative. ""For U.S. global systemically important banks... the incremental capital needed would likely outweigh the benefits of material regulatory relief."" The Fitch report estimates the banks would have to raise about $400B more in capital ""to qualify for the exemption under the CHOICE Act, an increase of around 43% compared to capital levels today.""

Ironically, Mr. Obama steps down as the recovery from that crisis is largely complete, which could leave Mr. Trump to preside over the longest expansion since World War II.

HSBC,Argentina in $6 Billion Repo Loan Deal With Six Banks; Repo loan deal reduces Argentina's need to sell bonds In 2017," Jan 13, 2017",0,"BUENOS AIRES--Argentina on Thursday closed a deal to borrow $6 billion in 18-month loans from six international banks, Finance Minister Luis Caputo said.
The deal, which substantially reduces the country's need to sell bonds this year, comes just before Mr. Caputo and other officials will travel abroad to promote the issuance of up $7 billion next Thursday.
Under the deal, Argentina will borrow $1 billion each from Santander, BBVA Frances, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and J.P. Morgan, paying an interest rate of Libor plus 290 basis points.
The deal helps assure the government can cover most of this year's financing needs in the first month of 2017. It also takes pressure off officials to issue more debt next week at higher rates than they might otherwise prefer.
""This is very, very positive news for us,"" Mr. Caputo told a news conference. ""This lowers our need to tap the market by $6 billion.""
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 98 of 1177
Mr. Caputo said his team has been working to guarantee this year's financing needs--about $20 billion in new debt- -while reducing exposure to potentially higher interest rates that some economists say could result from the election of Donald Trump in the U.S.
""Nobody knows what's going to happen,"" Mr. Caputo said. ""But our job is to minimize risk. This clears a potential cloud and helps reduce uncertainty so people can say that this year won't be tough.""
Argentina plans to sell up to $5 billion in dollar-denominated bonds and up to $2 billion in peso-denominated debt, Mr. Caputo said. He added that the government plans to keep investors hungry for additional debt and won't likely issue as many bonds as possible next week.
Mr. Caputo said Argentina's debt to GDP ratio is among the lowest in Latin America and easily sustainable compared with other countries that have issued debt at lower rates than Argentina.
""Most of the time we're not issuing debt to pay for spending but to replace maturing bonds,"" Mr. Caputo said. ""Expectations are that demand will be very good.""

The WSJ Dollar index was down 0.2% at 91.92, deepening its losses for the year to date to 1.1% as the post-U.S. election rally across financial markets has stuttered.
Gold plunged after Donald Trump's election as expectations of corporate tax-cuts, higher inflation and a faster escalation of U.S. interest rates pulled money into riskier assets and sent the dollar soaring.
HSBC Securities wrote that a sharp upward move in gold on Wednesday--credited by many analysts to investors' disappointment at Mr. Trump's first post-election press conference, which yielded little detail on policy--might have had a different cause.
""The main move higher in gold came after the briefing and may not have been in reaction to anything Mr. Trump said,"" wrote HSBC analyst James Steel. ""A 10-year U.S. Treasury auction was well received and U.S. bond prices eased lower. In turn, the USD fell more steeply and gold surged higher.""
Analysts at Citi, meanwhile, said they expect to see ""gold price pain before gains,"" saying the impact of rising rates, which weigh on gold, will likely outweigh demand stemming from persistent political risk.

HSBC,China December Exports Tumble More Sharply Than Expected; The country is bracing for further difficulties this year given the prospect of a more protectionist U.S. administration," Jan 13, 2017",0,"BEIJING--Chinese exports fell sharply last month owing to weak demand in many major markets, and the government and economists are bracing for further difficulties this year given the prospect of a more protectionist Trump administration .
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 102 of 1177
Exports slipped 6.1% in December from a year earlier compared with a 0.1% gain in November , China's customs administration said Friday. December's decline was steeper than the drop of 3% that was the median estimate of 11 economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. It also made December the eighth month out of the past nine in which exports fell, with November's small increase the exception.
Imports in December rose 3.1% from a year earlier, roughly in line with expectations, compared with a 6.7% gain in November. China's trade surplus narrowed last month more than expected to $40.82 billion from $44.61 billion in November.
Overall in 2016, exports fell 7.7% and imports declined 5.5%, resulting in an annual trade surplus of $510 billion, below the $594.5 billion trade surplus in 2015 .
Chinese exports saw slipping demand across all major regions except the U.S., which saw a 5% increase, according to the customs data. Though economists said the weaker numbers also reflected a less favorable comparison with year-earlier data, when exports were relatively strong, anemic demand and trade tensions cloud the outlook for a return to more robust trade.
""Overall, exports will face challenges over the next couple of quarters,"" said RHB Group economist Fan Zhang. He said it is very likely a Trump administration will ""play hardball"" with China.
Chinese officials are sounding sober about the economic and political headwinds China is facing. Customs spokesman Huang Songping at a briefing on Friday called China ""the biggest victim"" in the anti-globalization trend.
Ministry of Commerce spokesman Sun Jiwen, a day earlier, cited mounting protectionism as a challenge and said that Beijing will ""try all methods"" to stabilize trade, including steps to help exporters expand foreign markets and become more competitive.
Companies too said that they're feeling the pinch and are concerned that trade tensions lie ahead.
Hejian Yongxing Tableware Factory, which exports knives, bowls and pots to the U.S. and Europe from its base in the northern city of Hejian, said sales are down while labor and raw material costs are up a total of 30% in recent months, forcing it to increase prices.
""That's led to an obvious decline in orders and our profits are squeezed a lot,"" said Chu Liping, the company's general manager. ""And if Mr. Trump increases trade tariffs, business will be even tougher.""
Beijing has allowed China's currency to fall against the dollar--it depreciated 7% last year --but the yuan appreciated 1% in 2016 against a trade-weighted basket of currencies. Mr. Huang said Friday the impact on trade of the yuan's depreciation against the dollar is limited.
Economists said any higher tariffs or related policies enacted by the incoming Trump administration that reduce U.S.-China trade could undercut broader growth in the world's second-largest economy, which has been steady.
""More protectionist trade policies, including higher tariffs or trade tension, could weigh on sentiment as well as economic activity,"" said HSBC Holdings PLC in a report. It said that China is likely to respond to any trade tensions with the U.S. by accelerating trade and investment links with other emerging markets.

December's uptick in imports was due in part to higher global commodity prices, economists said, and that too could moderate in coming months.
Some economists said China is unlikely to issue a foreign trade growth target this year for the second year in a row after missing its benchmark by wide margins in 2013, 2014 and 2015.

HSBC,"To Win Back Customers, Fashion House Fendi Thinks Small; Bag charms, interchangeable straps, pompoms prove popular with shoppers tired of cookie-cutter accessories"," Jan 14, 2017",0,"ROME--Fendi, the Italian fashion house that shot to fame and fortune on the Baguette bag only to be laid low by mismanagement, is hot again. And it is thanks to pompoms and shoulder straps.
The Rome-based house has regained its buzz with new products conceived by chief designer Karl Lagerfeld and Silvia Venturini Fendi, creative director of accessories. One is interchangeable straps that customers can use to personalize their Fendi purses or even other brands' bags. The straps--made in python, suede, fur or leather and costing as much as $2,400 each--are geared toward shoppers tired of cookie-cutter accessories.
Mr. Lagerfeld also is offering colorful pompoms to adorn bags. One pompom made of fur and leather costs $900; another is adorned with a cartoonish image of Mr. Lagerfeld himself. Fendi is courting cost-conscious customers with straps as low as $500 and bag charms costing $350. Olivia Palermo and Jessica Alba are among the celebrities often photographed with Fendi straps or bag charms.
""Who...would have thought a customer would spend thousands adorning their bag in straps and pompoms?"" said Josie Gardner, Selfridges' buying manager for accessories.
Analysts say the new accessories are catching on. ""Fendi is getting a great traction with consumers and has consistently posted double-digit growth in the last quarters,"" said Mario Ortelli, an analyst at Bernstein.
Fendi has struck a sweet spot many fashion houses are betting on: customization. Other brands such as Gucci, Prada and Burberry are now offering a range of products that can be personalized. Gucci, for instance, has started

offering shoppers the option to have a Gucci emblem or their initials stitched on bags or shoes.
""[Customization] serves a double function"" by appealing both to shoppers who are new to the brand and fashionistas who can't yet afford the house's pricier products, says Fendi Chief Executive Pietro Beccari.
Such products are helping some houses combat a slowdown in luxury-good sales that will likely make this year the worst for the sector since 2009, analysts say. ""There is new purchase behavior"" now, said Carlo Alberto Beretta, chief client and marketing officer at Kering SA, owner of Gucci. ""Millennials are more individualistic. They want unique things, not mass products.""
Founded in 1925, Fendi became known for bags and fur coats worn by celebrities such as Jacqueline Kennedy and Sophia Loren. In the 1990s, Ms. Fendi, the founder's granddaughter, invented the Baguette bag, a global success that spurred the brand's popularity and also figured in a plotline on ""Sex and the City.""
In 1999, LVMH Moe?t Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE and Prada SpA bought a majority stake in Fendi , valuing it at about [euro]1 billion ($1.06 billion), which analysts at the time considered rich for a business of Fendi's size.
The new owners wanted to make it the next Prada, but the popularity of the Baguette soon cooled and other products struggled to take off. In the 2000s, the Roman brand repeatedly struggled to deliver goods to stores on time and opened several shops in a short time, many of which were soon closed. As four CEOs headed the firm in as many years, the company lacked continuity.
LVMH later bought out Prada and proceeded to broaden the firm's store network, production systems and product lineup.
Fendi has gained momentum and buzz since Mr. Beccari took over in 2012, after his predecessor Michael Burke streamlined the supply chain and improved financials, in part by playing down its logos as customers tired of megabrands. Mr. Beccari also changed the design and introduced on-site made-to-measure services.
The chief executive struck on a winning digital strategy. For example, it reached the highest engagement rate in 2016 with its Instagram followers and increased popularity on Snapchat by making content--which would normally disappear soon after being posted--always available on its website. The company is now working to offer one-day delivery service and is pushing shop assistants to also suggest that customers place online orders while in the store.
""I came at a time when Instagram and Snapchat were exploding,"" says Mr. Beccari. ""The brand needed to speak to a younger audience but at the same time become more sophisticated.""
All this helped push Fendi's revenue last year up more than 50% from 2012, according to an HSBC estimate.
LVMH now is heavily investing in Fendi to squeeze out even more growth, people familiar with the matter say. Analysts expect Fendi to reach [euro]1 billion in annual revenue this year.

HSBC,Asian Shares Weaker as Uncertainty Ticks Higher; Nikkei Stock Average hit 2017 lows in falling 1.1%," Jan 16, 2017",1,"Shares in Asia were broadly lower on Monday, with Japan among the biggest losers as a stronger yen weighed on the Nikkei.
More of the choppy trading conditions from last week were present, with skittish investors showing their nerves ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration Friday. Market volumes were also likely to be leaner with traders in the U.S. offline Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday.
""What was initially observed to be market euphoria following Trump's U.S. election victory has gradually transitioned to mounting caution as the markets watch if Trump will follow through with his business-friendly promises,"" said Woon Tian Yong, an investment analyst at Phillip Futures.
In Europe, the pound's continued slide added to market unease. The currency slid more than 1% as investors fretted over the likelihood of a ""hard-Brexit"" scenario ahead of a key speech on Tuesday by U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May.
Japan investors came back from their lunch break in a selling move, with the Nikkei Stock Average hitting 2017 lows in falling 1.1%. With a stronger yen, export-reliant companies were seeing their shares underperform; Mitsubishi Motors fell 2.2% while Sharp slid 4.2%.
The weakness comes as early Monday, the Bank of Japan said an index measuring the prices of goods being traded between Japanese companies fell 1.2% from a year earlier in December, the smallest decline in nearly two years.
Across the region, Korea's Kospi was off 0.4%, the Taiex in Taiwan slipped 0.9% and the Hang Seng Index was 1% lower.
According to Andrew Sullivan, managing director of sales trading at Haitong International Securities, U.K. fund managers might offload some of their Hong Kong stocks to bring repatriate money. This thesis appeared to divide the Hong Kong market, with blue-chip British bank HSBC down 0.9% while rival Standard Chartered rose 0.6%.
In China, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.4% as institutions have been cutting positions in small-caps, some analysts say. The index has fallen six of the past seven weeks and was set for a fifth-straight daily decline on Monday.
But Jacky Zhang, an analyst at BOC International, said things were likely to bottom out soon though. ""The market has very little further downward momentum, and the sluggish performance in smaller caps since last week was largely due to mutual funds dumping growth stocks,"" said Mr. Zhang.
Bucking the regional trend, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.4%, buoyed by strong gains in utilities stocks and higher commodity prices. That includes big gains in Chinese futures markets for steel rebar and iron ore.
Investors are taking cues from Beijing's sustained efforts to reduce capacity, as a top official from the coal-mining hub of Shanxi province pledged to eliminate around 20 million tons of coal and 1.7 million tons of steel capacity.

HSBC,U.K. Pound Falls to Three-Month Low on Brexit Concern; Investors fret over the likelihood of a hard Brexit ahead of a key speech by Theresa May," Jan 16, 2017",1,"The pound traded at three-month lows against the dollar on Monday as investors fretted over the likelihood of Britain pulling out of the European Union's single market.
The fall came ahead of a key speech by U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday, in which she is expected to elaborate on her government's priorities in negotiations over Britain's exit from the EU.
Despite the pound's recent decline, many investors believe that the currency has yet to fully reflect the political risks facing the British economy.
For many investors, the biggest concern would be if the U.K. left the single market, its main trading partner. Over the weekend, several British newspapers reported that Mrs. May will point toward a clean break from the single market in her speech on Tuesday.
Reacting to this, the pound fell as much as 1.6% against the dollar late Sunday before rising slightly in Asian trading hours on Monday. As European markets closed, the pound changed hands at $1.205, down 1.1%. The pound fell by around 0.6% against the euro, to [euro]1.138.
The plunge against the dollar leaves sterling at its weakest levels since October's ""flash crash,"" when a combination of illiquid markets and bearish sentiment around the pound sent the currency plunging 9% in a matter of minutes, to below $1.15.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 113 of 1177
""Even after a 30-cent fall, the pound still hasn't fully priced the reality of Brexit,"" said Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Westpac. Mr. Callow said that the pound's steep fall following weekend news reports reflects this.
A Downing Street spokeswoman declined to comment on those reports or the pound's decline.
Sterling will drop to parity with the euro, or around $1.10 to the dollar, ""if the market was to fully price hard Brexit,"" said Oliver Harvey, a strategist at Deutsche Bank. Mr. Harvey defines a hard Brexit as leaving the single market without a transitional deal.
Many investors and people in Britain hoped, even following last June's referendum, that the U.K. could leave the EU but stay in the single market. But European leaders have told the U.K. several times that it can't have membership in this tariff-free market without allowing free movement of EU citizens, something that many who voted for Brexit are against.
The U.K. economy has recently outperformed expectations . But many analysts say leaving the single market will hit economic growth.
Analysts at HSBC and Goldman Sachs predicted the pound will fall to $1.14 and $1.10, respectively, by the end of 2017.
Westpac's Mr. Callow believes that speculative selling of the pound could force it to around $1.18 in the coming weeks.
Speculators including hedge funds held 65,831 more short than long contracts on the pound in the week to Jan. 10, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Investors use short contracts to bet on a currency's decline.
Investors are focusing on commentary from British politicians, promising volatile trading in the coming weeks.
Senior government ministers have started to openly talk about how Britain will respond to any loss of access to the single market.
In recent days, the government has hinted that it will lower business taxes if the EU treats it too harshly in trade negotiations.
""If we are forced to do something different because we can't get the right deal, then we stand ready to do so,"" Mrs. May's spokeswoman said on Monday
Not everyone is buying into a scenario of doom and gloom.
Stephen Innes, senior currency trader at Oanda, cautioned against taking statements on the negotiations at face value.
""Negotiations of this size and importance are bound to involve an element of bluff to ensure that the U.K. would get the best possible deals,"" he said. ""Without actual confirmation of these 'hard' measures, we could be viewing little more than 'sell the rumor,' and we may end up buying the fact.""

Some businesses also point out the benefits of a weaker currency, which while raising the cost of exports boosts the competitiveness of some exporters.
Mrs. May also received a boost late Sunday from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. In an interview with The Times newspaper, Mr. Trump said that his administration was going to work hard to forge a quick trade deal with the U.K.

HSBC,"Strong Dollar Steps In to Bolster Some Economies; U.S. currency's surge aids efforts to raise growth and spark inflation, goals that have proven difficult to achieve despite years of stimulus policies"," Jan 16, 2017",0,"The stronger dollar is giving some economies a boost that stimulus measures struggled to deliver, even as the U.S. currency's rally threatens commodity prices and emerging markets.
By weakening other currencies, the dollar's surge has aided the efforts of governments and central banks to raise growth and spark inflation, goals that have proven difficult to achieve despite years of easy-money policies.
In Europe , the euro's 2.7% decline against the dollar since Nov. 9 helped push consumer prices up at their fastest annual rate in three years in December.
A weaker currency tends to push up inflation by making imports more expensive, while benefiting exporters by making their goods more competitive abroad.
As the dollar rises against the Japanese yen, it has fanned an 18% rally in the Nikkei since early November and bolstered growth expectations. The Bank of Japan last month raised its assessment of the economy for the first time since May 2015, citing improving sentiment and a weaker currency.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 116 of 1177
""These countries want growth. Negative rates and stimulus haven't done the trick, and they figure a weaker currency may help,"" said Robert Savage, chief executive of the currency hedge fund CCtrack Solutions LLC. ""The world can wake up and say a euro below $1.00 is not actually a bad thing.""
A dollar that rises too high or too quickly can become a problem. A strong U.S. currency tends to create headaches for emerging markets and others who have borrowed heavily in dollars by making their debt more difficult to service. Commodities, which are priced in dollars, come under pressure as they become more expensive to foreign buyers. U.S. growth tends to suffer too as the burgeoning currency hurts corporations. For some countries, weaker currencies have provided a tailwind.
The yen's unexpected burst of strength early last year hit the profits of Japan's big exporters, dragged down stock prices and pushed the BOJ to abandon its goal of pushing inflation up to 2% from subzero levels. But a reversal in the yen's climb in the fourth quarter sent Japanese shares to a year high.
The yen's nearly 8% drop against the dollar since early November will help strengthen Japan's economy and improve inflation sentiment, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said last month. Tokyo now sees the economy picking up speed to 1.5% growth from an estimated 1.3% in the year ending in March.
The falling yen ""helped unlock value in Japan's stock market,"" said Vinay Pande, head of short-term investment opportunities at UBS Wealth Management. ""If you can put away the deflation monster, there is plenty of upside in that market.""
Mr. Pande has owned and sold Japanese stocks last year and is looking to purchase them again if the Nikkei dips.
Weaker domestic currencies have also helped Russia and Brazil shore up growth after commodity prices plunged in recent years, propelling their equities to outsize gains in 2016. Russia's stock market rose 52% last year, while Brazil's notched a 39% return.
The cheaper ruble helped offset falling prices for the country's oil producers, cushioning the impact of a nearly 80% drop in crude from 2014 to 2016, Mr. Pande said.
""Russia's market was destroyed, and now they are seeing upside,"" said Mr. Pande, who holds Russian equities. ""A weaker currency helped unleash that value.""
The International Monetary Fund expects Russia's economy, which has suffered falling oil prices and sanctions, to grow 1.1% this year after a 0.8% contraction in 2016.
Meanwhile, some believe that the stronger dollar's harmful effects may already be manifesting, especially in emerging markets, where rising consumer prices are already high and a falling local currency risks sparking capital outflows.
Central banks in emerging markets such as Brazil will be limited by how much monetary easing they can deliver, as lower rates make their currencies less attractive to investors while U.S. rates are rising, HSBC said in a report.
China raised interbank rates to their second-highest level ever in early January in a bid to support the yuan and stanch capital outflows. Central banks in Mexico and Turkey have also raised rates to defend their falling

currencies.
For now, ""most central banks would rather have a weaker currency than a stronger one,"" said Kit Juckes, a strategist at Socie?te? Ge?ne?rale. ""However, you can have too much of a good thing.""

HSBC,Investors See Big Gains Outside U.S. Monetary policy is looser and valuations lower in many global stock markets; strong dollar could cap American equities," Jan 16, 2017",1,"U.S. equity markets have raced higher , but some investors are betting the rest of the world is about to catch up.
Investors have piled into U.S. stocks since the election of Donald Trump, pushing up share prices in so-called cyclical sectors such as banks and industrials, which tend to benefit from a pickup in economic growth.
Some now believe the next spur in global stock markets will come from outside the U.S., where monetary policy is looser, valuations are lower and shares have more room to rise.
There are reasons for caution on international stocks, from Europe's fractious politics to frailties in
emerging economies and lackluster growth in Japan . That helps explain why stocks in these regions look relatively cheap.
Still, international markets may now advance as investors look for cheaper stocks and move out of U.S. shares that now look expensive, some analysts and investors say.
""We would expect areas outside of the U.S. to outperform,"" said Supriya Menon, senior multiasset strategist at Pictet Asset Management.
Global economic growth should continue to improve and further fuel the so-called reflation trade ""that will see Japan and Europe benefiting and catching up with the U.S.,"" Ms. Menon said.
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 119 of 1177
In recent months, the reflation trade has seen investors sell bonds and buy more stocks across the developed world on expectations that Mr. Trump will boost U.S. growth by cutting taxes and regulation and increasing fiscal spending. International stocks have risen, too, as investors look for a rebound in global growth.
Economists at HSBC recently raised their two-year global growth forecast for the first time since early 2012, projecting 2.5% for 2017, up from a September forecast of 2.3%.
Investors have sold safer defensive companies in sectors such as health care--which provide steady streams of income when growth is low--in favor of morecyclical stocks such as banks, which should benefit from a pickup in growth and inflation. The S&P 500 Financials subindex is up about 22% over the past three months, while its Health Care counterpart has gained about 1.2%.
Since Mr. Trump's election on Nov. 8, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 8.5% and the S&P 500 is up 6.3%. For dollar investors, the Stoxx Europe 600 has risen about 5%, and the Nikkei Stock Average has gained about 2.3%.
One reason for U.S. outperformance is that for dollar investors, the value of European and Japanese shares have fallen as local currencies have declined. In local currency terms, the Stoxx Europe 600 is up more than 9% while the Nikkei has gained more than 12%. But the S&P 500 has gained even more sharply for overseas investors--about 10.6% in euro terms and about 16.7% in yen.
Despite the recent surge, U.S. stocks are facing potential headwinds, analysts say.
That includes the dollar, which in early January hit its highest level since 2002. In the past, a strong dollar has eaten into earnings of U.S. companies that sell overseas. The dollar's strength is a competitive advantage for many European and Japanese exporters.
U.S. stocks have also been gaining as investors bet on a continued improvement in corporate earnings, analysts say. So any earnings undershoot could dent share prices, especially given the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates. When looking at a company, the amount investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings tends to decline when rates rise.
Recent gains in U.S. equities mean the market looks expensive compared with the rest of the world. Pictet's Ms. Menon said the U.S. is close to the most expensive it has ever been, compared with Europe and Japan across a range of valuation gauges.
On one metric, stocks listed on the Stoxx Europe 600 index have a price-to-book value of 1.9, making them far cheaper than the 3.2 value of the Dow.
""The U.S. will do OK, but I think it's running out of headroom,"" said Guy Miller, chief market strategist at Zurich Insurance Group Ltd. ""We've seen a market that has done very well but is now looking quite expensive.""
The recent outperformance of U.S. equities is unusual--international markets have tended to do better when cyclical stocks are favored over so-called defensive shares, according to analysis from Absolute Strategy Research.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 120 of 1177

David Bowers, head of research at ASR, said investors tend to hold U.S. companies when the global economy is weak because many consider them to be safer, more defensive investments, and then shift into cheaper non-U.S. companies when growth picks up.
Mr. Bowers attributes the recent outperformance of U.S. markets to big gains in bank shares on investor hopes of deregulation of that sector.
There are, though, reasons for investors to be cautious about shifting into international markets. Chief among those are European elections, from the Netherlands to France, whose outcomes could challenge eurozone unity and spark political and economic turmoil across the continent.
Also, the U.S. has a ""significantly"" higher economic growth potential than either Europe or Japan, said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, chief multiasset strategist at BlackRock Inc.
That won't stop some investors from increasingly looking outside the U.S. for returns. Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company, has been reducing holdings in U.S. stocks and adding to international shares in recent months on prospects for higher global growth.
""We're looking for cheaper valuations and where pessimism is highest. That's overseas now,"" Mr. Schutte said. Write to Christopher Whittall at christopher.whittall@wsj.com and Riva Gold at riva.gold@wsj.com

Investors are focusing on comments from British politicians, promising volatile trading in coming weeks.
Senior government ministers have started to openly talk about how Britain will respond to any loss of access to the single market. In recent days, the government has hinted that it will lower business taxes if the EU treats it too harshly in trade negotiations.
""If we are forced to do something different because we can't get the right deal, then we stand ready to do so,"" Mrs. May's spokeswoman said Monday
Not everyone is buying into a scenario of doom and gloom.
Stephen Innes, senior currency trader at Oanda, cautioned against taking statements on the negotiations at face value.
""Negotiations of this size and importance are bound to involve an element of bluff to ensure that the U.K. would get the best possible deals,"" he said. ""Without actual confirmation of these 'hard' measures, we could be viewing little more than 'sell the rumor,' and we may end up buying the fact.""
Some businesses also point out the benefits of a weaker currency, which while raising the cost of exports boosts the competitiveness of some exporters.
Mrs. May also received a boost late Sunday from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. In an interview with the Times newspaper, Mr. Trump said that his administration was going to work hard to forge a quick trade deal with the U.K.

HSBC,Malaysia Central Bank Expected to Keep Policy Rate Unchanged: WSJ Poll; Bank Negara Malaysia is also widely expected to maintain the statutory reserve requirement ratio at 3.5%," Jan 17, 2017",1,"KUALA LUMPUR--Malaysia's central bank is expected to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Thursday, a poll showed.
All of the 11 economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal this week expect Bank Negara Malaysia's monetary policy committee to hold its overnight policy rate at 3.00%.
""Rising commodity prices and decent strength in industrial activity should keep Bank Negara Malaysia on the sidelines,"" Harish D. Gupta, economist with Barclays said.
Stronger economic data in the Southeast Asian nation since the new year has started to ease worries over a slowing economy plagued by weaker oil prices since mid-2014. Earlier this month, Malaysia released November data showing stronger exports, growth in retail sales and industrial production.
The stronger data comes as the ringgit has weakened over 6% against the U.S. dollar since Donald Trump's U.S. election victory in November. The ringgit has been among the worst-hit currencies since Mr. Trump's presidential win.
""The pressure to ease rates are somewhat limited by the volatile financial markets and weaker ringgit,"" said Julia Goh, an analyst at Singapore's United Overseas Bank.
Bank Negara Malaysia's governor Muhammad Ibrahim said Friday the central bank may introduce more measures to deal with foreign-exchange volatility if necessary, following the slide in the ringgit.
Last month, the central bank announced several measures to support the ringgit including allowing better hedging flexibility in its onshore currency market.

""Nevertheless, there is still room for further rate cuts should growth fall below expectations in 2017, and if the ringgit stabilizes at a stronger level,"" BIMB Securities economist Imran Nurginias Ibrahim said.
Bank Negara Malaysia is also widely expected to maintain the statutory reserve requirement ratio at 3.5%.
However, the likelihood of keeping the overnight policy rate unchanged is expected to reopen the possibility of further cuts in the statutory reserve ratio in the coming quarters, particularly if interbank rates start to rise again, according to HSBC Global Research.
The central bank had reduced the rate to 3.5% from 4.0% in January, 2016 to boost liquidity.
Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid, chief economist at Bank Islam Malaysia, expects Bank Negara Malaysia to maintain the overnight policy rate at 3.00% throughout 2017.

HSBC,Bank of Canada Expected to Hold Key Rate Steady; Bank Governor Stephen Poloz suggested in October further easing wasn't necessarily off the table," Jan 17, 2017",1,"OTTAWA--Canada's central bank is widely expected to leave its key interest rate unchanged this week following encouraging economic data and signs the business outlook may be improving.
Ten out of 11 primary dealers of Canadian government securities surveyed by The Wall Street Journal predicted the Bank of Canada would maintain its current rate of 0.5% during a scheduled announcement on Wednesday.
A majority of those economists also said they expected the key rate to remain unchanged until at least the end of
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 128 of 1177
2017.
""The bar to actually cut interest rates again is quite high,"" said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist for CIBC World Markets. ""But the slack in the economy also means we would have to have a spectacular surprise on the plus side for them to think of raising rates in 2017.""
The Bank of Canada cut interest rates twice in 2015 in response to the sharp drop in global commodity prices, which hurt Canada's energy exports and prompted many businesses to cut jobs and investment plans. The central bank held the key rate at 0.5% throughout last year, but Governor Stephen Poloz suggested as recently as October that further easing wasn't necessarily off the table.
Bank of Nova Scotia economist Derek Holt said the central bank may use the policy report that accompanies its rate announcement to highlight the stronger jobs and export data that was released earlier this month, along with signs of an improving outlook for business investment. However, Mr. Holt said any optimism will have to be balanced against the risks of greater protectionism in the U.S. and relatively weak inflation in Canada.
""I think you want to signal a little bit of encouragement, but you don't want to risk taking the punch bowl [of low interest rates] away anytime soon,"" he said. Mr. Holt said he doesn't anticipate a rate increase until mid-2018, at which point he expects the central bank may begin to raise the key rate.
David Watt, chief economist at HSBC Bank Canada, was the only economist surveyed who called for a rate cut on Wednesday. He said his firm had raised its forecast for U.S. growth, but is skeptical that president-elect Donald Trump's new administration will be able to do much in the short-term. At the same time, Mr. Trump has championed protectionism in the U.S., which Mr. Watt said could hamper Canada's exports and make it more difficult for Canada to benefit from a possible boost in U.S. infrastructure spending.
""It's this uncertainty that makes me think that we should be taking a cautious view about the potential impact,"" of Mr. Trump's presidency, Mr. Watt said.

HSBC,"For British Pound, Politics Matters More Than Economic Data; Investors focus on Britain's negotiations to leave the European Union; positive economic data has done little to boost sterling"," Jan 17, 2017",0,"
Politics is replacing economic data as the main driver of daily moves in the British pound.
In a reversal from how most developed-world currencies mainly trade, good economic news often hits the pound while bad data can boost it. These moves come as investors second-guess how economic news could affect Downing Street's thinking on Brexit.
The pound surged 3.1% against the U.S. dollar late Tuesday in New York, rising to $1.2414, its biggest daily percentage gain in eight years. Sterling gained 2.1% against the euro to [euro]1.1587. Though a weaker dollar played a role, the big gains followed a speech in which Prime Minister Theresa May set out her negotiating position on Britain's expected exit from the European Union.
Ms. May's speech offered greater clarity on Britain's position while promising Parliament a vote on the final Brexit deal, a detail that sent sterling soaring because U.K. lawmakers have been mainly against the country leaving the EU.
""The speech has reduced some of the worries that things can go more extreme and the government's approach would be more aggressive,"" said Themos Fiotakis, co-head of foreign-exchange strategy at UBS Group AG.
On Monday, the pound had closed at a 31-year low on reports that Ms. May would say the U.K. is leaving the single market, the EU's tariff-free trade bloc and Britain's biggest trading partner.
While Ms. May confirmed in her speech Tuesday that the U.K. plans to leave the single market, many investors had already taken this into account. Instead, they focused on the greater clarity on Britain's position, Ms. May's mainly diplomatic tone toward her European neighbors, and the fact that a parliamentary vote could either derail Brexit or force the government into greater accommodation with Brussels.
Rupert Harrison, a strategist at BlackRock Inc. and former senior U.K. Treasury official, tweeted that the pound's move was logical given that the ""bad news"" had been discussed and Mrs. May was now adding relative certainty. Britain's economic performance has consistently surprised analysts since the country's vote to leave the EU last June. But positive data has done little to boost sterling. Instead, some investors believe that good economic news could encourage Britain to push for a more complete break from Brussels, a scenario that they argue will eventually harm the U.K.
""Sterling is almost negatively correlated with the economic data,"" said Oliver Harvey, a strategist at Deutsche Bank AG. ""The market sees that the better the data is, the less incentive both sides have for a constructive deal.""
Earlier on Tuesday, unexpectedly strong U.K. inflation data pushed the pound briefly higher against the dollar and euro, but the rise was erased after less than an hour. Higher inflation would typically boost the pound because it could push the Bank of England to increase interest rates, which would likely draw money to the country.
The pound should move relatively closely with economic data. A stronger economy often means more demand for the currency, better returns for investors and higher interest rates. Currencies in emerging markets will often closely track politics, but exchange rates in more stable developed-world economies mainly focus on data and central-bank pronouncements.
Sterling's trade against the dollar has been moving in the opposite direction to Citigroup Inc.'s Economic Surprise
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 131 of 1177
Index for the U.K., according to Paul Hollingsworth, an economist at Capital Economics. The index measures whether U.K. economic data is better or worse than analysts' forecasts. When it is better, the measure rises. The index climbed from a score of 2, when the U.K. voted to leave the EU on June 23, to as high as 87.1 in October. Over the same period, the pound had fallen 17% against the dollar.
""The fact that we've had stronger economic data perhaps bolsters the case for a hard Brexit,"" said Mr. Hollingsworth. ""It allows policy makers to be bolder with their ambitions.""
The shifts don't mean that economics doesn't matter for the pound. Investors are judging that the long-term impact on the U.K.'s relationship with its major trading partners in Europe is more important than short-term economic performance. Brexit supporters believe that the U.K. economy will thrive outside of the EU, unhampered by EU bureaucracy and as the country is able to seal its own trade deals elsewhere in the world. Analysts and investors said an exit risks hampering trade with Britain's biggest trading partner.
""It used to be a very cyclical currency responding to small changes in expected interest rates,"" said Dominic Bunning, strategist at HSBC Holdings PLC, referring to the pound. ""It's now a political and structural currency."" One factor is the Bank of England. Since the Brexit vote, central-bank officials have said that they are willing to tolerate higher inflation. That means that good economic data doesn't have the immediate effect it once did, because the inflation it could stoke may not be as important to the central bank. ""You're interested in whether the economy is picking up and what the Bank of England will do, but now the [the bank] says it'll look through inflation,"" said Mr. Bunning.

HSBC,"ECB: Going Nowhere Despite German Inflation Anxiety; The focus for investors should be on Washington, and not the ECB and its battles with its German critics"," Jan 19, 2017",0,"Even when the European Central Bank does nothing, it can still move markets. The euro fell half a cent against the dollar Thursday as ECB President Mario Draghi delivered a dovish take on the apparent pick-up in eurozone growth and inflation.
The ECB is sticking with its December plan : bond purchases will be scaled back from April 2017 to [euro]60 billion a month from the current pace of [euro]80 billion, but will carry on until at least the end of 2017, and beyond if necessary. It said it could still increase purchases again if economic conditions deteriorate.
But Mr. Draghi did face questioning about rising eurozone inflation, which reached 1.1% in December, having hovered around zero for the early part of the year. HSBC economists think it could be 1.8% by February, approaching the ECB's target of ""below, but close to"" 2%. The pick-up is causing disquiet in Germany, where inflation reached 1.7% in December, a concern that was reflected in many of the questions Mr. Draghi faced.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 133 of 1177
Mr. Draghi emphasized that the rise in inflation has to be ""durable"" and ""self-sustained"". A rise in energy inflation alone will not be enough for that. And most importantly, it should be reflected across the whole eurozone - not just in a few member states. German gripes should count for little. After all, during the early years of the euro, the inflation target for the eurozone was only achievable because higher inflation elsewhere offset subdued price pressures in Germany, which was undertaking economic reforms. It is Germany's turn to run hot.
The overall message is clear: the ECB is going nowhere in a hurry. In conjunction with a more hawkish tone from the U.S. Federal Reserve , that could weaken the euro. But the driver of that exchange rate lies on the U.S. side. The focus for investors should be on Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen and President-elect Donald Trump, not the ECB and its battles with its German critics.

HSBC,Notable &amp;amp; Quotable: China as a 'Global Leader'; 'Do not let fake news or well crafted press release outshine reality.'," Jan 19, 2017",1,"Economist Christopher Balding of Peking University HSBC Business School writing on his blog, baldingsworld.com, on Jan. 18:
I want to briefly address the laudatory statements about Xi and China as the global leader. Rather than focusing on the press release differences between Xi and Trump let's focus on facts.
1. As of a couple of years ago, there were less than 650,000 foreigners living in China and only 1,200 had received a Chinese ""Green Card"" granting permanent residency. China is now the largest sender of immigrants to the United States due to concern about a variety of issues.
2. China is the world's largest user of coal, the dirtiest energy source, and plans to use more.
3. Wind power generation, as a share of all power generation, is roughly 50% higher in the United States than in China.
4. Average US internet speeds topped 50 MBs while in China that number just passed 10MBs and for accessing foreign sites it is significantly slower due to the Great Firewall.
5. The China plans to shut down Chinese access to non-Beijing controlled websites. This is on top of their enormous censoring work and rumored work on their tests to disable the entire internet or their nearly half trillion fake social media posts to push the Party line.
6. An average Chinese tariff rate of 19.6% compared to the US rate of 2.6%. China maintains a 9.6% average rate for other WTO members while the US has a 2.5% weighted average for WTO members.
7. China maintains an [sic] long ""negatives"" list of industries in which foreigners simply cannot invest. This includes such high tech national security industries as cotton. Even the recent roll back still includes ""2 entries, down from 93 ones in the previous version."" Even now, most investors require a Chinese joint venture partner and are simply prohibited from having a wholely [sic] owned Chinese subsidiary.
8. China recently denounced judicial independence telling judges they were to do what the Party wanted.
9. China openly admits to imprisoning critics and political enemies of the Great Leader.
10. China continues to restrict international capital flows despite joining the IMF SDR and promoting RMB
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 135 of 1177
internationalization. Excluding flows within China controlled territory, the RMB ranks below the Danish krone for international payments and transactions.
I could do this all day long pointing out the facts that paid consultants and press shills for China are required in their contract to abide by, but we should make sure that we do not let fake news or well crafted press release outshine the reality."
HSBC,U.K.'s Theresa May Meets With Wall Street Bank Chiefs; Meeting with prime minister follows lenders' warnings about moving jobs from London after Brexit," Jan 19, 2017",1,"U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May met Thursday with the chief executives of several Wall Street banks, following further warnings by lenders that they would shift jobs out of London to continental Europe after Brexit.
Mrs. May met with J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. Chairman James Dimon, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman in a meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland , according to people familiar with the matter.
The executives talked with Mrs. May about implementation periods and the status of some of their decision making, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Some executives discussed how moving certain functions such as trading out of London would also mean moving compliance and other staff, the person said.
Downing Street declined to confirm whom the prime minister had met, saying the meeting with representatives of financial services companies was private. A spokesman did confirm that Mrs. May had met with senior representatives of other companies including Siemens AG, British Telecom PLC, and WPP PLC, during her visit to the Swiss town.
Speaking to Bloomberg Television in Davos, Mrs. May said she had positive meetings with bank CEOs and other executives. She said she had brought a message to Davos that she wanted to build a global Britain outside the EU that advocates free trade and that she wanted to negotiate an agreement that allows British companies the best possible access to trade with and operate within the bloc.
""I value financial services in the City of London and I want to ensure that we can keep financial services in the City of London and that global Britain, I believe, will do just that,"" she said, referring to London's financial district. Earlier Thursday, Mrs. May delivered a speech at the Davos gathering where she emphasized that Britain was open for business. The message comes two days after the prime minister confirmed that the U.K. would be leaving the European single market and wanted to be excluded from parts of the bloc's customs union.
Since the U.K.'s June vote to leave the European Union, banks have been drawing up contingency plans to ensure that they can still service clients inside the trading bloc once the U.K. departs.
Mrs. May said earlier in the week that her government would push for a transition period after the Brexit deal was reached. Several bank executives welcomed having more time to adjust their operations. Wall Street employs thousands of people across the U.K.
In Davos, several bank chiefs said they would continue to wait and see how Brexit negotiations progressed before
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 137 of 1177
making definitive decisions on whether and how many staff to move from Britain.
Executives at UBS AG said that around 1,000 jobs in the U.K. would be affected if the country lost its ability to freely sell financial services into the EU. HSBC Holdings PLC Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver reiterated that as many as 1,000 jobs could be moved to the bank's Paris office. However, he added that this wouldn't be until after the negotiations, which are due to last two years, are complete. J.P. Morgan warned before the Brexit vote that as many as 4,000 jobs could leave the country.
Other banks are cutting their presence in London. Credit Suisse Group AG Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam told CNBC Thursday that the bank was aiming to cut head count in London from 8,000 to 5,000 over the medium term. He added that this had nothing to do with Brexit.

HSBC,"Argentina Sells $7 Billion of Bonds, Moves to Meet 2017 Financing Needs; Finance minister says demand 'confirms trust investors have in capacity to control inflation, spur growth'"," Jan 19, 2017",0,"BUENOS AIRES--Argentina sold $7 billion in five- and 10-year bonds on Thursday as government officials moved to meet most of their 2017 financing needs this month on expectations interest rates will rise after U.S. President- elect Donald Trump takes office.
Argentina sold $3.25 billion in five-year bonds at an interest rate of 5.625% and $3.75 billion 10-bonds at 7%. That puts the government's financing costs down about 200 basis points from April, when it issued $16.5 billion in debt .
The country received offers to buy $22 billion in debt, the Finance Ministry said.
""We're very happy with the results of this issuance because we've significantly lowered our financing costs even as we face an outlook of much more adverse rates than a year ago,"" Finance Minister Luis Caputo said in a statement. ""This confirms the trust that investors have in our capacity to control inflation and spur economic growth,"" he

added.
Annual inflation totaled about 40% in Argentina at the end of last year, though central bank officials hope to lower that to between 12% and 17% by the end of 2017.
Economists expect the inflation rate to decelerate to about 22% this year while they see the economy expanding about 3% after shrinking more than 2% this year.
The bond sale comes a week after the government agreed to borrow $6 billion in 18-month debt from a group of international banks including Santander, BBVA Frances, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and J.P. Morgan.
Taken together, the bond issuance and the short-term loan deal allow Argentina to meet about 65% of its need to issue fresh debt this year, Mr. Caputo said last week.

HSBC,"Wall Street Struggles to Cash In on Yuan's Swoon; High cost of borrowing in China, country's effort to punish short sellers are cited"," Jan 21, 2017",1,"Across Wall Street, many see further declines in the Chinese yuan as a nearly sure thing. But making money on them is proving anything but.
Investors and analysts widely expect that the yuan will fall against the dollar this year, extending a 6.6% drop in 2016 that was the largest in two decades. The bearishness reflects China's slowing economy, rising debt and volatile capital outflows, as well as concern that the world's most-populous nation could be headed for a trade showdown with the Trump administration.
China reported Friday that its economy grew by 6.8% in the fourth quarter and 6.7% for 2016. While it met China's target, the annual rate is the lowest in a quarter of a century.
But bets on yuan declines generally have performed poorly in recent years, reflecting factors including high borrowing rates in China and Hong Kong. In addition, aggressive efforts this year by Chinese authorities to punish short sellers are discouraging some yuan bets.
Valentina Chen, a Zurich-based emerging-market bond manager at Vontobel Asset Management, said she is ""very comfortable"" that the yuan will depreciate against the dollar over time, but ""in the short term it is very difficult to trade.""
In part, that is because so many hedge funds and other asset managers have been shorting the yuan, pushing up trading costs.
Foreign investors typically use forward contracts or put options in the offshore market, centered in Hong Kong. Holding a 12-month forward contract costs 4.8% annually, after reaching as high as 6.6% in early January, up from 2.5% last year. Holding an option to sell yuan is also expensive, recently costing 5.1% annually.

Denver-based Crescat Capital has been betting against the Chinese currency in recent years but trimmed its short position late last year by letting two of its three put options expire, said Chief Investment Officer Kevin Smith. Instead, the company has begun to focus on bets against Chinese banks on the idea that a credit crisis is likely to emerge before a currency crisis.
Colin Harte, a multiasset portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Investment Partners in London, said he is betting on a decline in the new Taiwan dollar instead, since it is cheaper. Desmond Soon, head of investment management for Asia, ex-Japan, at Western Asset Management in Singapore, has been holding fewer Chinese bonds rather than shorting yuan.
Shorting the yuan is ""not as easy as you would think,"" said Mr. Smith of Crescat Capital. The firm's bearish bets against China returned 0.2% in 2016.
This week, the People's Bank of China didn't roll over its expiring medium-term lending facility to banks as many had expected, adding to concerns about a liquidity squeeze and sending the one-day funding cost to as high as 2.7%. Some short sellers in the currency were forced out due to higher funding costs.
Some investors are also constrained by factors that increase the effectiveness of official interventions, in which authorities drive up borrowing costs in Hong Kong in a bid to force those betting against the yuan with borrowed money to close out their trades at a loss.
Many hedge funds and other traders trade on margin, using borrowed money that can become more expensive in a short squeeze, or must report their results periodically to investors, raising the prospect of unhappy questions when results are negative.
China first allowed the yuan to trade outside its borders in 2010, creating a parallel exchange rate known as CNH. Average daily spot volume in the CNH market is about $10 billion to $12 billion, roughly one-third of the $35 billion within mainland China, according to HSBC estimates.
But that market's activity has been declining amid rising borrowing costs, exacerbating some of the swings in short-term yuan funding costs. Yuan deposits in Hong Kong stood at 627.6 billion yuan in November, down 37% from a peak of 1 trillion yuan at the end of 2014, according to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
""It's quite clear now that the Chinese are very active in the offshore market, if and when they want to be,"" said Dwyfor Evans, head of Asia-Pacific macro strategy at State Street Global Markets. ""It's not as freely traded as we initially thought,"" he added.
Everyone isn't squeezed equally. Some groups such as affluent investors with long time horizons can maintain the trade if it pays out modest but regular returns over time, said Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer of Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management Group.
Ms. Mossavar-Rahmani's group has been recommending that clients short the yuan against the dollar since mid- 2015, contending China could face a financial crisis spurred by heavy capital outflows and a sharp increase in debt. She said the trade has been profitable.
Citing the risk of further interventions, Goldman recommends that clients limit their exposures relative to the size of their portfolios and diversify by holding options to exit from the trade at various levels and times.
Axel Merk, chief investment officer at Merk Investments LLC in San Francisco, said he has added to his short position on the yuan recently. He holds longer-dated forwards in the offshore market that are less affected by spikes in short-term rates and is waiting for China to focus more on economic reform than on punishing short sellers.
""The way you fight capital flight is to make your country more attractive to investors,"" he said.

IPO Could Raise
$2 Billion or More
Guotai Junan Securities Co., China's third-largest brokerage firm by assets, has filed for a Hong Kong initial public offering that people familiar with the situation say could raise $2 billion or more by midyear.
The Shanghai-based firm filed for its IPO with the Hong Kong stock exchange on Friday. A spokeswoman for Guotai Junan didn't respond to a request to comment.
Chinese brokerages have been tapping the offshore market to fund expansion plans. Citigroup Inc.'s China securities joint-venture partner, Orient Securities Co., China Merchants Securities Co. and Everbright Securities Co., all launched multibillion-dollar offerings in Hong Kong last year. All three companies are trading marginally below their listing prices.
Guotai Junan, which listed in Shanghai in 2015, plans to use proceeds from the IPO to develop its prime brokerage, personal-financial services and investment-management businesses, as well as for overseas expansion and the growth of other divisions within the firm, according to the filing.

Colin Harte, a multiasset portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Investment Partners in London, said he is betting on a decline in the new Taiwan dollar instead, since it is cheaper. Desmond Soon, head of investment management for Asia, ex-Japan, at Western Asset Management in Singapore, has been holding fewer Chinese bonds rather than shorting yuan.
Shorting the yuan is ""not as easy as you would think,"" said Mr. Smith of Crescat Capital. The firm's bearish bets against China returned 0.2% in 2016.
This week, the People's Bank of China didn't roll over its expiring medium-term lending facility to banks as many had expected, adding to concerns about a liquidity squeeze and sending the one-day funding cost to as high as 2.7%. Some short sellers in the currency were forced out due to higher funding costs.
Some investors are also constrained by factors that increase the effectiveness of official interventions, in which authorities drive up borrowing costs in Hong Kong in a bid to force those betting against the yuan with borrowed

money to close out their trades at a loss.
Many hedge funds and other traders trade on margin, using borrowed money that can become more expensive in a short squeeze, or must report their results periodically to investors, raising the prospect of unhappy questions when results are negative.
China first allowed the yuan to trade outside its borders in 2010, creating a parallel exchange rate known as CNH. Average daily spot volume in the CNH market is about $10 billion to $12 billion, roughly one-third of the $35 billion within mainland China, according to HSBC estimates.
But that market's activity has been declining amid rising borrowing costs, exacerbating some of the swings in short-term yuan funding costs. Yuan deposits in Hong Kong stood at 627.6 billion yuan in November, down 37% from a peak of 1 trillion yuan at the end of 2014, according to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
""It's quite clear now that the Chinese are very active in the offshore market, if and when they want to be,"" said Dwyfor Evans, head of Asia-Pacific macro strategy at State Street Global Markets. ""It's not as freely traded as we initially thought,"" he added.
Everyone isn't squeezed equally. Some groups such as affluent investors with long time horizons can maintain the trade if it pays out modest but regular returns over time, said Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer of Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management Group.
Ms. Mossavar-Rahmani's group has been recommending that clients short the yuan against the dollar since mid- 2015, contending China could face a financial crisis spurred by heavy capital outflows and a sharp increase in debt. She said the trade has been profitable.
Citing the risk of further interventions, Goldman recommends that clients limit their exposures relative to the size of their portfolios and diversify by holding options to exit from the trade at various levels and times.
Axel Merk, chief investment officer at Merk Investments LLC in San Francisco, said he has added to his short position on the yuan recently. He holds longer-dated forwards in the offshore market that are less affected by spikes in short-term rates and is waiting for China to focus more on economic reform than on punishing short sellers.
""The way you fight capital flight is to make your country more attractive to investors,"" he said.

HSBC,Uneasy Times Great for Gold," Jan 23, 2017",0,"GOLD IS STARTING TO REGAIN ITS LUSTER IN THE NEW YEAR, REVERSING A LONG string of losses following the U.S. presidential election.
The precious metal came under pressure after the election of Donald Trump prompted a rally in the dollar, U.S. stocks, and riskier financial assets. The decision by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December further weighed on gold prices, and central-bank officials indicated they may raise rates another three times in 2017.
However, analysts say gold looks ready to stage a comeback as political and economic risks gain renewed attention with the presidential transition. Gold prices rose to a two-month high on Tuesday, trading at their highest level since Nov. 17. On Friday, futures for February delivery closed at $1,204.90 an ounce, up 0.7% for the week in its fourth consecutive week of gains. ""The world marketplace is getting a bit anxious,"" said Jim Wyckoff, senior analyst at Kitco Metals, in a Wednesday note.
Comments from Trump helped support gold Tuesday, after he told The Wall Street Journal that the dollar is ""too strong,"" sending the currency lower. A strong dollar has hurt gold prices in the past couple months, since gold is priced in dollars and becomes more expensive to foreigners as the U.S. currency rises.
The annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, also highlighted challenges in globalization and trade, according to James Steel, head preciousmetals analyst at HSBC in New York. Expectations for slowing global trade may help push gold higher, he says.
The investor enthusiasm that pushed stocks up on hopes for economic growth and stimulus has tempered in the new year, and some see that as a bullish sign for gold. The metal is often viewed as a haven asset by investors and is in high demand in times of uncertainty and risk-off sentiment.
The rally that took the Dow Jones Industrial Average within points of 20,000 in the past month has stalled. The Standard &Poor's 500 index has been moving sideways in recent weeks and has traded 67 days without closing more than 1% lower, according to Bespoke Investment Group.
Meanwhile, gold has gotten a boost from bargain hunters in the new year. Asset allocators have had renewed interest in the metal, says George Gero, managing director at RBC Wealth Management, driving total positions higher. In a Friday report, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said precious metals saw the first inflows in 10 weeks from private clients, of $1.3 billion, the largest weekly amount in five months. The SPDR Gold Trust exchangetraded fund (ticker: GLD), meanwhile, has risen 5% this year.
While the prospect of higher rates should weigh on gold, some investors are doubtful of the Fed's ability to carry through with its announced plans to raise short-term interest rates, especially in the face of political uncertainty.
Bart Melek, head of commodities research at TD Securities, says doubts over U.S. growth prospects could slow the pace of rate hikes this year: ""The Federal Reserve is going to be very cautious of how it approaches monetary policy.""
Gold will also benefit if Trump's plans to boost infrastructure spending and economic expansion fail to materialize.

""The political reality is, I think, a little bit less robust than the market predicted,"" says Melek. That could translate into more gains for the metal. *"
HSBC,Alibaba Earnings: What to Watch; E-commerce giant seen profiting from China's strong online retail growth," Jan 23, 2017",0,"Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. will report its earnings Tuesday for the fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31, before the U.S. market opens. Here's what you need to know.
EARNINGS FORECAST: Alibaba is expected to report a net income of 13.7 billion yuan ($2.0 billion) for its fiscal third quarter, up from the 12.5 billion yuan it earned a year earlier, according to estimates from 16 analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
REVENUE FORECAST: Alibaba's quarterly revenue is likely to have risen 46% from a year earlier to 50.4 billion yuan from 34.5 billion yuan a year earlier, based on an S&P survey of 29 analysts. This would be a record quarterly revenue for Alibaba, which runs China's most popular online shopping websites, Taobao and Tmall.
WHAT TO WATCH:
--SEC PROBE AND COUNTERFEITS: Look for an update on the Securities and Exchange Commission's investigation into Alibaba's accounting practices . Alibaba has drawn the SEC's attention in the past over alleged sales of fake goods on its Chinese website, and analysts have raised concerns about its use of financial measures that don't comply with generally accepted accounting principles and because it doesn't consolidate results of some affiliates.
The company may also discuss measures it plans to take after the company was put back in December on the U.S. Trade Representative's list of global marketplaces known for counterfeit and pirated goods .
ALIBABA CLOUD: Alibaba's cloud computing arm provides data management and related services to businesses in China and overseas. Alicloud is the country's largest provider of cloud services with as much as 40% market share. AliCloud's customers include vendors on its online and mobile e-commerce ecosystem, and Alibaba says the unit has more than 651,000 paying customers. The group is expanding, opening four new data centers overseas in Germany, Dubai, Australia and Japan. Nomura Securities, HSBC Global Research, and Credit Suisse all expect revenue from Alibaba's cloud business to more than double in the third quarter, following similar growth the quarter before. Morgan Stanley expects AliCloud sales to reach $1 billion in its fiscal year 2017.
China's cloud market is still in its infancy, and market leader Alibaba has a golden opportunity here, analysts from
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 151 of 1177
Nomura wrote in a recent note. Still, its leadership position could be challenged by other cloud-providers such as Tencent Holdings and Baidu Inc.
STRONG CHINA RETAIL: Online retail growth continues to outstrip overall retail growth in China, the latest government statistics show. Online retail sales of goods and services increased 26% from a year ago to 5.16 trillion yuan in 2016, compared with 10% growth in overall retail sales. Alibaba is poised to ride that wave.
The company is also set to get a boost from its Nov. 11 Singles Day sale. This year, Alibaba said merchants sold a record 120.7 billion yuan of goods on its platforms that day, 32% more than in 2015.
With e-commerce sales expanding at a slower pace, especially in big cities, Alibaba and other internet retailers are turning to new consumption segments for growth. Alibaba, JD.com's Yihaodian, and smaller startups such as Shanghai-based Freshfresh are investing in building their fresh food and grocery segments. To win in this arena, retailers must be able to offer specialty items including imports, premium brands or strong in-house labels, and have a good supply chain for fresh produce, according to Vincent Lui, a Shanghai-based partner at BCG.
DIGITAL MEDIA REVIVAL: Alibaba established its digital media and entertainment unit in June 2016, and has appointed Yu Yongfu as the unit's chief executive. In an internal email last month, Mr. Yu pledged to invest more than 50 billion yuan over the next three years in expanding operations. In a report, HSBC analyst Chi Tsang described 2016 as a year of ""rebirth and integration"" for Alibaba's entertainment affiliate, and expects the recent structural changes to allow Alibaba to refocus on producing quality content and gaining market share. E-COMMERCE AND PHYSICAL STORE INTEGRATION: Investors are also watching closely for updates on Alibaba Executive Chairman Jack Ma's strategy to deepen links between the retailer's online operations, brick-and-mortar stores and logistics. Alibaba said earlier this month it would team up with the founder of China's Intime Retail (Group) Co. to take the Hong Kong-listed department-store operator private. Alibaba and Intime's founder, Shen Guojun, will pay as much as 19.8 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$2.55 billion). Alibaba, which already has a 28% stake in Intime from a 2014 investment, would see its shareholding would rise to about 74% after the deal.

IPO Could Raise
$2 Billion or More
Guotai Junan Securities Co., China's third-largest brokerage firm by assets, has filed for a Hong Kong initial public offering that people familiar with the situation say could raise $2 billion or more by midyear.
The Shanghai-based firm filed for its IPO with the Hong Kong stock exchange on Friday. A spokeswoman for Guotai Junan didn't respond to a request to comment.
Chinese brokerages have been tapping the offshore market to fund expansion plans. Citigroup Inc.'s China securities joint-venture partner, Orient Securities Co., China Merchants Securities Co. and Everbright Securities Co., all launched multibillion-dollar offerings in Hong Kong last year. All three companies are trading marginally below their listing prices.
Guotai Junan, which listed in Shanghai in 2015, plans to use proceeds from the IPO to develop its prime brokerage, personal-financial services and investment-management businesses, as well as for overseas expansion and the growth of other divisions within the firm, according to the filing.

PBOC's Yi Defends Efforts to Stabilize Yuan Rate: State Media
The Chinese central bank's efforts to steady the yuan's exchange rate by digging into its foreign-exchange reserves will be more beneficial than harmful, says People's Bank of China Vice Gov. Yi Gang in an essay published in state media. ""Foreign reserves are meant to be utilized,"" Mr. Yi says. The central bank used about $1 trillion from its foreign-exchange reserves over the past two years to prevent the yuan from falling sharply, the official says. The timing to tap into the reserves was right, successfully stabilizing the yuan rate, he says. The world's largest stockpile of foreign currency fell $41.08 billion in December to $3.011 trillion, the lowest level since March 2011. Liyan Qi
China Signals Monetary Policy Is Still Slight Tightening
A move by China's central bank to raise interest rates on a type of special loan to certain financial institutions is more a signal than anything else. Late Tuesday, the People's Bank of China said it raised the borrowing cost on loans to 22 financial institutions via the medium-term lending facility, a new liquidity tool in place since 2014. The move was a surprise and came as the bank has been flooding the financial system with cash ahead of the Lunar New Year, when Chinese consumers go on shopping sprees and hand out red packets of cash. But Tuesday's rate increase was in line with policy makers' message that 2017 will be about containing asset bubbles and maintaining financial stability, with a slight bias toward monetary tightening. ""Yesterday was to show that the PBOC still wants to tighten,"" says Chen Long, a Beijing-based banking analyst at consultancy Gavekal. ""It doesn't want the market to interpret too much on the liquidity injection"" around the holidays.

Bundesbank Pressure to End ECB QE Could Hurt Eurozone Economy
HSBC says Deutsche Bundesbank pressure on the European Central Bank to end its QE program could lead to an early taper. It warns this could be detrimental to the eurozone economy if the ECB tightens policy due to rising inflation, which has been fueled by higher commodity prices, repeating the mistake of 2011. Back then, rising commodity prices led to a cosmetic pickup in headline inflation not corresponding to a pickup in economic activity. On the other hand, an early taper wouldn't be damaging if it is done because a genuine rise in economic activity is pushing up prices.

HSBC,China Bond Yields Near Highest Level Since 2015; Moves come after China raised rates on tool central bank uses to manage liquidity," Jan 25, 2017",1,"Chinese government bond yields are approaching their highest level since September 2015, after authorities overnight tightened a key rate on loans to financial institutions.
The yield on China's benchmark 10-year government bond climbed to 3.336% on Wednesday compared with 3.296% late Tuesday, approaching a recent peak in mid-December when yields hit 3.383%.
Late Tuesday, China raised rates on an important tool that the central bank uses to manage liquidity, called the medium-term lending facility. Some analysts are interpreting the move as an effective interest-rate increase, which would be the first such step since 2011.
The decision is the latest evidence of Beijing fiddling with the dials of monetary policy to tamp down rampant credit growth, while simultaneously keeping enough liquidity in the financial system for banks to meet funding needs and prevent market panic.
""Undoubtedly this is a tightening signal,"" said Pin Ru Tan, director of Asia-Pacific rates strategy at HSBC Holdings PLC in Singapore. ""One of China's top priorities this year is to reduce financial leverage, prevent asset bubbles and avoid a systemic crisis.""
Last week, the People's Bank of China pumped 1.13 trillion yuan (roughly $165 billion) --a weekly record--into domestic money markets ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, when Chinese traditionally give gifts of cash in red envelopes. The rush of cash withdrawals tends to tighten liquidity this time of year, particularly because markets will be closed from Jan. 27 through Feb. 2.
Chinese officials have put deleveraging at the top of their agenda for 2017, after a flood of cheap, post-financial- crisis money pushed up prices of financial assets from real estate and corporate bonds to iron ore and soybean- meal futures. China's money supply has more than quadrupled since 2007, sending more cash after a shrinking pool of appealing investment options, just as capital controls keep money coursing through Chinese assets rather than those abroad.
The build-up of credit in the bond market began in 2015, when the central bank started holding short-term borrowing rates at very low, stable levels to boost growth. By the summer of 2016, roughly 90% of interbank borrowing was in the overnight market, the shortest and cheapest form of funding.
Many investors used the cheap cash to buy bonds and other financial products, and then used those securities as collateral to invest even more. Much of this borrowing was done through off-balance sheet products, adding layers of leverage and financial risk beyond regulators' view.
Officials started to crack down on this pattern in August, by pushing borrowers to longer-term maturities, which elevates short-term funding costs. The impact of this gradual tightening campaign combined with a more hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve and default scares triggered a deep selloff in the onshore bond market in mid-December.
At that point, China halted trading in some bond futures contracts for the first time, after 10-year and five-year futures fell 2% and 1.2%, respectively. Currently, 10-year bond futures are down 0.90% and five-year bond futures are down 0.50%.
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 159 of 1177
Officials' deleveraging efforts have shown some signs of success: The daily volume of overnight transactions has fallen to 1.96 trillion yuan from a peak of nearly 4 trillion yuan over the summer, according to BNP Paribas. Now, roughly 70% of interbank borrowing is in the overnight market.
China's decision to raise rates on medium-term lending facilities by 0.1 percentage point--to 2.95% for the six- month and 3.10% for the one-year tenor--isn't terribly dramatic. More important, for market watchers, is the affirmation that officials' tighter stance is here to stay.
""While the size of the rate increase is modest, the signal seems clear that the PBOC has stepped up the tightening bias,"" wrote economists at Goldman Sachs in a note.
Despite temporary bouts of volatility, there are some signs that the long-term view on China's bond market is nevertheless optimistic.
On Wednesday, Bloomberg announced that it would create two new indexes, set to launch March 1, that will include China's onshore government and policy bank bonds.
The move could accelerate inclusion into other closely tracked international bond indexes, such as J.P. Morgan's emerging-market government bond index, and accelerate foreign participation in China's onshore bond market, said Becky Liu, a China macro strategist at Standard Chartered. Foreigners currently own less than 2% of China's onshore bond market.
Index providers have been charting China's progress in opening up its financial markets as a condition for inclusion. Deutsche Bank estimates that China's addition to some indexes could help boost foreign investment inflows into China to $700 billion-$800 billion over the next five years.

HSBC,"Under Trump, U.S. Banks Could Get a British Makeover; Recent comments by Steven Mnuchin suggest the U.K. could be a model for banking regulation under President Donald Trump"," Jan 25, 2017",0,"
Just what banking regulation will be like under President Donald Trump remains unclear. But recent comments by Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin suggest he might be looking across the Atlantic to the U.K. for inspiration.
That isn't necessarily good news for investors in the biggest U.S. lenders.
In his Senate testimony last week and in written responses to senators this week , Mr. Mnuchin repeatedly raised the specter of some kind of ""21st Century Glass-Steagall,"" without giving any details.
Mr. Mnuchin clearly doesn't favor a simple return to the Great Depression-era law. In his written comments, Mr. Mnuchin said that ""a bright line between commercial and investment banking...may inhibit the necessary lending and capital markets activities to support a robust economy.""
So what does Mr. Mnuchin want? So far, he isn't saying. But one possibility would be a ""ringfencing"" of retail bank operations such as that being put in place in the U.K., says Karen Petrou, analyst at Federal Financial Analytics. Under this system, U.K. banks like Barclays and HSBC must establish separate subsidiaries that contain their local
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 161 of 1177
U.K. operations serving individuals and small businesses, funded by government-guaranteed deposits. Their global investment-banking businesses stand outside this ringfence with their own capital, allowing them in theory to be wound down if they run into trouble without endangering the retail bank or necessitating a government bailout. Legislation along these lines could conceivably garner support from both parties, avoiding a Democratic filibuster in the Senate.
Such a scheme also could help Mr. Mnuchin square his seemingly contradictory comments on the Volcker rule. He has said banks with federally insured deposits shouldn't be taking trading risks with their own money, but also that trading restrictions on those banks have harmed market liquidity.
For universal banks like J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America, the potential implications are huge. They would have to decide if it is worth incurring the costs of undergoing a ringfencing process, including potentially higher overall capital requirements , or if it would be more efficient to just break up, potentially losing some synergies between units. Either way, it will be a cumbersome process.
Another question is how the hived-off investment-banking units would be funded. It would be problematic if they were overly dependent on short-term wholesale finance, as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were. One possible source of funding would be corporate deposits, which aren't insured.
U.S. banks don't necessarily want another regulatory revamp that forces further rethinking of fundamental business models, after years of adapting to current rules. Tweaks to the existing system, such as looser Volcker- rule enforcement, would suit them just fine.
But in today's political scene, big banks can't bet on getting exactly what they want. Until the regulatory outlook is clearer, investors should be mindful of the risks.

HSBC,Gucci Looks Like Fashionable Pick for Luxury Rebound; Brands can no longer count on store rollouts and timeless appeal to drive growth," Jan 25, 2017",1,"Demand for luxury goods is rebounding, but the rising tide may not lift all boats. Investors need to pay more attention to fashion than they used to.
Last year was the luxury industry's worst since the 2009 crisis: HSBC estimates that sales grew just 1% at constant currencies. Chinese consumers, whose spending accounts for roughly 40% of revenues, much of it outside of China, seem to have been spooked by terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels as well as a weaker renminbi.
Fortunately, the trend improved as 2016 progressed, with a contraction in the first half followed by a rebound in the third quarter. Early sales updates from Cartier-owner Richemont and Burberry this month have reinforced hopes that the fourth quarter was even stronger than the third.
Stores in mainland China have led the recovery. But investors would be unwise to assume a return to the good old days when China's appetite for European luxury brands seemed both limitless and indiscriminate. There are two
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 163 of 1177
crucial differences between today's industry and the postcrisis world of 2010-13.
Brands can no longer guarantee growth by opening hundreds of new stores. Most already have retail estates stretching well into the Chinese mainland. Companies are therefore looking to improve the productivity of the stores they already have--a sensible strategy, but one that inevitably pits them against each other more than they are used to.
Second, luxury consumers, including in China, are increasingly choosing innovation over tradition. Burberry reported last week that ""fashion"" -- or newly designed items--outperformed sales of core products like its famous trench coats in the Christmas quarter. Such is the thirst for novelty that the British brand is experimenting with a ""see now, buy now "" model, whereby clothes modeled on the fashion-show runway are immediately available for sale.
This trend is a challenge for companies used to selling products on the basis of timeless appeal. It is also a challenge for investors. Barclays has charted social media mentions and ""likes"" in an effort to assess ""brand heat,"" but admits it is hard to draw firm conclusions.
An alternative way to gauge fashionability is to look at the share of a brand's product range that has been recently redesigned. Companies don't typically advertise data of this kind, but one that has reason to is Gucci, which accounts for three-fifths of operating profits at luxury group Kering. Following a complete product overhaul since the appointment of a new creative director in early 2015, more than 80% of Gucci products for sale in the third quarter were new--up from 50% to 60% in the second quarter. Quarterly sales rocketed 17% year-over-year, suggesting this is having a major impact. In the fourth quarter, some 90% of products were new, which bodes well. Share prices have risen sharply across the sector since October. Sector bellwether LVMH Moe?t Hennessy Louis Vuitton now trades at 24 times prospective earnings, well above the 10-year average. With expectations already high, investors need to be careful they don't buy shares in a company that only participates halfheartedly in the rebound. A clear turnaround story like Gucci may be the best hedge against disappointment.

HSBC,Asian Shares Broadly Higher After Another Record Close on Wall Street; Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was up 1.4%," Jan 26, 2017",0,"Asian stock markets were broadly higher early Thursday, tracking overnight gains on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing above 20,000 points for the first time ever.
Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was up 1.4%, Korea's Kospi added 0.9% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 1.3%. Markets in Australia were closed for a holiday.
The postelection equities rally in the U.S. has been spurred by hopes of fiscal spending, tax cuts and regulation rollback under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.
Investors are upbeat that those expectations will soon be realized, given the speed with which Mr. Trump has been making executive orders just days into his administration, helping drive gains this week in the U.S.
""He has started to move...He has started to take action,"" said Margaret Yang, an analyst at CMC Markets.
On Wednesday, the Dow gained 155 points, or 0.8%, to 20,068, while the S&P 500 added 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1%. For Thursday, the market will be on the lookout for a slew of U.S. data, ranging from
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 165 of 1177
jobless claims to new home sales.
""There is more confidence in the U.S...The question is whether [Donald Trump's] protectionism is going to undermine that,"" said Andrew Sullivan, managing director of sales trading at Haitong International Securities.
In Asia, participants in several large markets are closing out positions ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, said Mr. Sullivan, with trading volumes down for the day. ""They don't want to be exposed until China comes back,"" he said.
Markets in China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam will be closed on Friday, with China closed through next Thursday.
Meanwhile, Thursday's stock gains in Asia were being driven by brokerage stocks. In Japan, Nomura Holdings was up 4.6% and Daiwa Securities Group was 3.8% higher. In Hong Kong, U.K. banking giant HSBC Holdings was last up 1.8%.
In currencies, the New Zealand dollar rose markedly against the U.S. unit after data showed that the country's inflation rose more than expected in the fourth quarter.
Consumer prices gained 0.4% in the fourth quarter and by 1.3% for the year, Statistics New Zealand said Thursday. Economists had expected consumer prices to rise 0.3% in the last three months of the year and by 1.2% over the year.
The New Zealand dollar rose to US$0.7300 from just below US$0.7270 before the report. In equities, the New Zealand NZX-50 index was up 0.3%.

HSBC,Gucci Looks Like Fashionable Pick for Luxury Rebound; Brands can no longer count on store rollouts and timeless appeal to drive growth," Jan 26, 2017",0,"Demand for luxury goods is rebounding , but the rising tide may not lift all boats. Investors need to pay more attention to fashion than they used to.
Last year was the luxury industry's worst since the 2009 crisis: HSBC estimates that sales grew just 1% at constant currencies. Chinese consumers, whose spending accounts for roughly 40% of revenues, much of it outside of China, seem to have been spooked by terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels as well as a weaker renminbi.
Fortunately, the trend improved as 2016 progressed, with a contraction in the first half followed by a rebound in the third quarter. Early sales updates from Cartier-owner Richemont and Burberry this month have reinforced hopes that the fourth quarter was even stronger than the third.
Stores in mainland China have led the recovery. But investors would be unwise to assume a return to the good old days when China's appetite for European luxury brands seemed both limitless and indiscriminate. There are two
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 167 of 1177
crucial differences between today's industry and the postcrisis world of 2010-13.
Brands can no longer guarantee growth by opening hundreds of new stores. Most already have retail estates stretching well into the Chinese mainland. Companies are therefore looking to improve the productivity of the stores they already have--a sensible strategy, but one that inevitably pits them against each other more than they are used to.
Second, luxury consumers, including in China, are increasingly choosing innovation over tradition. Burberry reported last week that ""fashion"" -- or newly designed items--outperformed sales of core products like its famous trench coats in the Christmas quarter. Such is the thirst for novelty that the British brand is experimenting with a ""see now, buy now "" model, whereby clothes modeled on the fashion-show runway are immediately available for sale.
This trend is a challenge for companies used to selling products on the basis of timeless appeal. It is also a challenge for investors. Barclays has charted social media mentions and ""likes"" in an effort to assess ""brand heat,"" but admits it is hard to draw firm conclusions.
An alternative way to gauge fashionability is to look at the share of a brand's product range that has been recently redesigned. Companies don't typically advertise data of this kind, but one that has reason to is Gucci, which accounts for three-fifths of operating profits at luxury group Kering. Following a complete product overhaul since the appointment of a new creative director in early 2015, more than 80% of Gucci products for sale in the third quarter were new--up from 50% to 60% in the second quarter.

HSBC,A Pound's Worth: Who Is Selling and What Does It Tell Us? Scarcity of data makes it hard to get a read on the currency's direction," Jan 26, 2017",1,"The British pound hit its highest level against the dollar since mid-December in early trade Thursday, the latest twist in what has been a particularly volatile period for the currency.
That choppiness was again on display Thursday. After rising early in the day, sterling fell back during the European afternoon amid broad dollar strength. By Thursday afternoon in New York, the pound was at $1.2590, down from $1.2633 late Wednesday in New York.
Those moves came as U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May headed to the U.S. ahead of a meeting with President Donald Trump on Friday to lay the groundwork for a trade deal between the two countries.
Many investors remain bearish on sterling, which has climbed roughly 5% since a recent low earlier this month but is still down about 16% since June's U.K. vote to leave the European Union .
Still, the avalanche of negative bets that has built up at various points in recent months appears to have eased
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 169 of 1177
somewhat lately, some gauges show. That suggests sterling choppiness may subside in the short term, though that could easily change once formal Brexit negotiations begin. The U.K. Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that Parliament must approve Brexit before the government can trigger the process.
Markets tend to be particularly vulnerable to sharp moves when investor positioning is lopsided, analysts said. Moves higher in the currency can encourage those ""shorting"" the pound--or betting on declines--to buy it back to limit losses. Similarly, moves lower can quickly turn into a free fall if the sentiment on a currency is overwhelmingly negative, as seen during the pound ""flash crash "" last October.
How Many Dollars One Pound Buys
But hard information on currency markets is sparse. Here is some of what is available on who has been selling sterling and what that might tell us about its direction.
What public data are available?
Not much. Sterling accounts for 13% of the $5.1 trillion that changes hands every day in foreign-exchange markets, according to the Bank for International Settlements. But most of that is traded through large investment banks in the opaque over-the-counter market. The best-known public data come from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The U.S. regulator releases weekly positioning from various investors on sterling futures contracts, a type of exchange-traded derivative.
What does that information say?
Speculative investors are betting on further declines in the pound. Speculators, or noncommercial investors as the CFTC calls them, hold 66,242 more short sterling contracts--options that bet sterling will fall--than long sterling. Still, that is some way down from the record of 97,572 more short positions in October after U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said she planned to start formal negotiations to leave the EU by the end of March this year. Speculative Investors' Net Positions on Sterling
Are the CFTC data any good?
To an extent. Traders pore over the data for clues on how the market is set up. But there are various flaws. The numbers reflect positioning on a Tuesday but aren't released until Friday--a considerable time lag for a market that trades on day-to-day news. Some analysts take issue with the broad-brush categories for different types of investors. And the information captures only a small subsection of the foreign-exchange market. It accounts for only $115 billion of foreign-exchange trades a day in exchange-traded instruments such as futures and options, according to the BIS, a tiny amount of overall volumes.
So what else is there to look at?
Some banks have developed their own proprietary models to estimate currency positioning. Strategists at HSBC Holdings PLC have developed an index that aims to replicate how ""momentum,"" or trend following, hedge funds are positioned on a currency. When a currency falls, trend followers will generally go short. If the pound rises consistently, they will flip to going long.
HSBC Positioning on Pound vs. Dollar
The statistics derived from these models are significant because a lot of big funds trade on momentum, said Mark McDonald, head of FX quantitative strategy at HSBC. But they are also important because a lot of active managers inadvertently hold momentum positions, he argues, as price action influences investment decisions. ""It's human nature,"" Mr. McDonald said.
The HSBC index suggests short positioning on sterling has eased lately from extreme levels earlier this month. Then what do the different data tell us?
The pound shouldn't be quite so volatile, at least for now. Less extreme positioning should mean moves in either direction are more muted. But expect things to change as the U.K. gets closer to triggering formal exit negotiations with the EU.
Are there buyers of the pound?
Yes. By definition, every seller of a currency needs a buyer. And there are data to suggest the buyers include some of the world's biggest investors: central banks. Sterling claims in central-bank foreign-exchange reserves increased

roughly $2 billion in the third quarter of 2016, to $350.83 billion, according to the latest available data from the International Monetary Fund. That is up from $311.92 billion in the third quarter of 2015, despite a small decline in total foreign reserves over that period.

HSBC,Growth Looms Larger Than Brexit for Bank of England; The Bank of England should keep its options open next week. But data showing continued strength in the U.K. economy will challenge its stance," Jan 26, 2017",1,"Brexit, what Brexit ? The U.K. economy has remained buoyant after the country's historic June vote to leave the European Union. That will raise questions about the Bank of England's policy path.
Growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 was 0.6% from the previous three months, the Office for National Statistics said Thursday--the same as
in the second and third quarters . Growth overall in 2016 was 2%, only just below 2015's 2.2%. Back in August, the BOE forecast ""little GDP growth"" in the second half of the year, leading it to cut rates and restart government-bond purchases. As the BOE meets next week, those purchases will be coming to an end.
The continued strength of the economy and the sharp rise in inflation --which is expected to increase well above the BOE target of 2% this year--would normally be pointing to an increase in interest rates. The market now thinks there is a 50% chance that the BOE will raise rates by December, economists at HSBC note.
But the BOE has signaled it can overlook the rise in inflation as a temporary effect from the falling pound. And there are still reasons for caution on growth. The strength in the economy in the fourth quarter all came from services: the U.K. economy is still very lopsided. The BOE may well want to see what happens once Brexit discussions with the EU start in earnest. Consumers face a tougher 2017 due to rising inflation.
Set against that is a stronger global backdrop. While the BOE will want to take some credit for the effect of its easing measures, the broad picture is one of stronger growth in many parts of the world, which should benefit the U.K.
The test for the BOE could come later this year. If the U.K. economy continues to provide positive surprises, then it will be harder for policy makers to ignore rising inflation. But the BOE has long been adept at adopting a stance of masterly inactivity. That seems the likely course for now.

HSBC,India's Growth Doesn't Have a Story; Headline growth of over 7% might look good when the global pace is sagging--but the underlying drivers aren't so solid," Jan 27, 2017",1,"For a plan to come together there has to be one in the first place. As India finds itself grappling with a sudden fall from grace, an economic blueprint continues to elude policy makers.
World-beating growth numbers of over 7% might look good when global growth is sagging, but the underlying drivers aren't so solid. Half of India's gross domestic product isn't actually improving. Meanwhile, of the other half, 15% is growing because of lower commodity prices and a third of that improvement is because of government actions, according to an HSBC analysis.
Since the government drained 86% of the cash in the Indian economy in November, economic activity has fallen sharply with no signs of recovery yet. Large swaths of the rural economy have been strangled just as consumption, a key source of growth, was gaining momentum, worsening India's chronic problems.
India's ad hoc reforms have led to colliding policy motives and consequences. In the most recent example, Prime Minister Modi has talked up an export-led model by endorsing the merits of his Make in India manufacturing program at a time when policy makers across the world are grappling with the rising threat of global protectionism. However, the cash-drain exercise pummeled the informal sector, home over to about a fifth of manufacturing jobs and nearly a quarter of India's GDP. Industries like leather, a key focus of Mr. Modi's manufacturing program, have seen production fall by 60% after the demonetization.
India continues to struggle in boosting fixed investment which continues to hover around just over a quarter of GDP, barely budging since a year ago. Meanwhile, subsidies and other expenditure make up a majority of government spending. Credit growth remains anemic because funding channels are clogged even as easy credit is extended to areas that won't ultimately boost investment. When Mr. Modi took office he embarked on global roadshows to lure investors. Global companies, though, have either withdrawn or are second-guessing plans to break ground in India, lamenting bureaucratic red tape.
None of this is new, but, considering the reformer Mr. Modi is touted to be, it is surprising such pitfalls haven't been made priorities. Government finances are in better shape. Fiscal discipline shouldn't mean capital spending loses primacy, though. Going by Mr. Modi's year-end speech, much will be spent on largely populist social spending ahead of key provincial elections . And, as the effect of low oil prices wears off, energy costs will divert cash away from investment and the recapitalization of weak public-sector banks just as nonperforming assets continue to build up.
In an ideal world, public investment could inspire confidence in the private sector and lure in long-term money rather than opportunistic investments. In India's case, a 1 percentage point GDP increase in the government's capital expenditure could lead to a 1.1 percentage point increase in real GDP growth over 18 months, according to HSBC analysts, pointing to the government's key role.
Business confidence has slumped and deep-pocketed investors, while appreciating conviction, now seriously question the unskilled execution of the cash reform that sent the economy on a downward trajectory for the foreseeable future.

HSBC,Big Chinese Deals Stall on Capital-Outflows Clampdown; Takeover pace slows on stricter policing of money leaving China," Jan 28, 2017",0,"The pace of big Chinese takeovers abroad is slowing as buyers contend with rules tightening the flow of money out of the country and increased government scrutiny at home and overseas.
Bankers say many of the record-breaking $225 billion in overseas acquisitions Chinese companies announced last year are stalled by financial or regulatory hurdles--including the country's biggest-ever deal, China National Chemical Corp.'s $43 billion bid for Syngenta AG , a Swiss seed and pesticide maker. European regulators this month extended the deadline for their review of ChemChina's bid a second time, to April.
More Chinese acquirers are backing out of deals. While Chinese firms announced more than double the amount of overseas acquisitions last year versus the previous, the value of deals withdrawn in 2016 was up around sevenfold, to $38.39 billion, according to Dealogic. The average number of days it took a Chinese buyer to complete an overseas deal in 2016 edged upward throughout the year, with November and December notching the highest levels, at above 140 days, according to Dealogic.
A major factor behind the slowdown: stricter policing of overseas acquisitions by Chinese regulators to curb a flood of money leaving the country.
The resulting uncertainty about regulatory approvals has damped some investors' enthusiasm for overseas deals. ""It is unmistakable that Chinese investors are far more cautious amid mounting uncertainties,"" said Fred Hu, chairman of Primavera Capital. Mr. Hu's Chinese private-equity firm is a prominent deal maker involved in last year's biggest U-turn: Anbang Insurance Group Co. dropping its $14 billion bid for Starwood Hotels &Resorts Worldwide Inc.
Mergers and acquisitions the world over go through cycles, and given the size, wealth and ambition of corporate China, financiers say the country's surge in overseas, or outbound, deals is likely not stopping, but taking a break. Some well-connected Chinese acquirers are still striking smaller deals. Ant Financial Services Group, an affiliate of online shopping giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., clinched a deal Thursday to buy U.S. money-transfer provider MoneyGram International Inc. for $880 million . Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. also agreed to sell its Dendreon cancer business to Chinese conglomerate Sanpower for $820 million earlier this month.
""In the long run, the trend of China Inc. going global should not be affected"" by the current foreign-exchange controls, said Wang Hongzhang, chairman of state lender China Construction Bank Corp., at a January event in Hong Kong. His bank offers financing for many Chinese outbound deals, including Anbang's Starwood bid.
For now, though, Chinese companies are increasingly anxious about deals abroad--particularly the biggest, which get the most scrutiny.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 176 of 1177
Chinese regulators, including the Commerce Ministry and the country's top economic-planning agency, must now clear many outbound deals larger than $1 billion, as well as everything more than $10 billion, before companies can get approval to move funds offshore, according to people with knowledge of the matter and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Regulators also are retroactively examining many pending deals that had earlier been approved, causing delays, according to people familiar with the matter.
State-owned China Resources Beer (Holdings) Co. dropped out of an auction for Eastern Europe brewing assets being sold by Anheuser-Busch InBev SA NV in December, after China's economic-planning agency declined to approve its bid, according to people familiar with the situation. Representatives for China Resources and AB InBev declined to comment.
Meanwhile, Chinese deals continue to face scrutiny from overseas regulators. Australia this month said it will set up a new body to assess security risks of foreign investments, following a surge in Chinese bids to purchase everything from ports to electricity assets. Anbang's $1.57 billion acquisition of U.S. life insurer Fidelity &Guaranty Life has stalled for more than a year because the Chinese insurer hasn't provided enough detail on its ownership to satisfy state insurance regulators, people familiar with the matter said. One of these people said Anbang is in talks with New York regulators and plans to refile its application in the first quarter.
Many sellers are asking for money to be placed in offshore escrow accounts to ensure they get paid, a development that has become common in the past year, bankers and lawyers say. HNA Group deposited $500 million in a U.S. account as breakup fee for its $6.5 billion proposed purchase of a 25% stake in Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.
State-owned ChemChina already was grappling with a heavy debt load before it struck the Syngenta deal. Worries about those debt levels caused one Chinese state bank to pass on financing the bid, according to people familiar with the situation. ChemChina's Chairman Ren Jianxin tapped HSBC Holdings PLC and China Citic Bank International Ltd. to lead the $33 billion loan-financing effort. The lack of strong backing from big state lenders raised questions among investors over whether the deal had full support from Beijing.
A ChemChina spokesman declined to comment and declined to make Mr. Ren available for comment.
The deal was approved in August by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. , or CFIUS, which scrutinizes deals for national-security risks and has blocked several high-profile Chinese deals during the past few years. In Europe, antimonopoly regulators are still combing through ChemChina's and Syngenta's assets to determine what may need to be divested after extending the deadline twice.
China's Commerce Ministry too has yet to give the nod, a person familiar with the matter said. It isn't clear whether the Chinese economic-planning agency is currently examining the deal.
""ChemChina and Syngenta remain fully committed to the transaction and are confident of its closure,"" said a Syngenta spokesman.
Mr. Ren has been undeterred by the delays, telling people around him not to worry about the fate of the Syngenta deal, and that the current obstacles won't influence other potential deals, people familiar with the matter said.

Ackerman's Take: Aspiring Fed Vice Chairmen--Caveat Emptor
Bankers are waiting with bated breath to see who ends up in the Federal Reserve post responsible for overseeing Wall Street . Yet the powerful job--Fed vice chair of supervision--has some significant drawbacks about which any aspirant should be forewarned.
For one thing, the job comes with no dedicated legal staff. Unlike other Senate-confirmed officials at federal financial agencies, Fed governors don't have their own cadre of attorneys charged with helping to craft speeches and policy statements. SEC commissioners, for instance, would generally be unable to slog through the at-times crushing legal workload without a stable of three or four experienced attorneys who are experts in specific areas of the law and work only for their bosses.
Though Fed governors increasingly have an assistant or two, they lack their own dedicated legal team and must instead rely on the central bank's legal staff at large. That has given some candidates pause when weighing whether to seek the position, according to lobbyists familiar with the thinking of some individuals who have interviewed for the role.
The post in question was created by Congress in 2010, but it has never been filled. Fed governor Daniel Tarullo, who has been effectively doing the job, has used the role to exert significant influence over the largest U.S. banks. His term as Fed governor expires in 2022, though he could step down sooner .
(David Nason, a Treasury official under President George W. Bush who now leads GE Energy Financial Services,
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 179 of 1177
has emerged as the front-runner for the bank-oversight job, The Wall Street Journal has reported , citing people familiar with the matter.)
Mr. Tarullo's power derives in large part from his ability to lead senior attorneys and supervisors who work for the Fed broadly--not for him--and who interpret whether the central bank's actions are consistent with the 2010 Dodd- Frank Act and other laws. More significantly, perhaps, Mr. Tarullo has maintained the backing of two successive Fed chiefs, who deferred to his views on regulatory and staffing issues, and he has proved adept at building consensus.
Anyone Mr. Trump nominates to the post probably won't enjoy the same degree of institutional support. A Trump nominee will aim to undo or ease much of the Fed's postcrisis work--an approach unlikely to gain traction with the agency's staff or with its chairwoman, Janet Yellen, who has said she intends to serve out her term through February 2018.
Moreover, other members of the Fed board can stay longer--so it might take years before a majority of the board's members are Trump appointees supportive of the new president's deregulatory bent.
To be sure, it's unlikely anyone would turn down a request from the White House to fill one of the most powerful regulatory posts in the federal government. But the role comes with significant challenges that will complicate the agenda of the new vice chair.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond
New Mnuchin Pay Disclosure Shows a $5.6 Million Payout
By Rachel Louise Ensign
During his final 15 months as a banker, Treasury Secretary-nominee Steven Mnuchin earned around $5.6 million in wages, bonus and incentive compensation, according to pay disclosures related to his confirmation process.
That is well below what Wall Street chieftains make, but still generous in comparison to executives at other regional banks, executive-compensation specialists said. Despite his Goldman Sachs Group Inc. pedigree, Mr. Mnuchin in his confirmation hearing described himself as a regional banker, the role he held in recent years.
Earlier disclosures from CIT Group Inc. of Mr. Mnuchin's compensation only covered a five-month period in 2015. The new disclosures, released earlier this month by the Office of Government Ethics, cover his pay for seven months spent as chief executive of the parent company of OneWest Bank and eight months as vice chairman of CIT.
In addition to his pay for that period in 2015 and 2016, Mr. Mnuchin also exercised stock options, received a ""dividend equivalent payment"" and had stock grants vest, the new disclosures show. Combined with a previously reported severance package, that brings his total for 2015 and most of 2016 to more than $39 million, although it is likely that the stock and option grants would have been earned in prior periods.
A spokesman for Mr. Mnuchin declined to comment.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 180 of 1177

Mr. Mnuchin and fellow investors created OneWest Bank in 2009 by buying failed IndyMac Bank at the height of the financial crisis. He sold it to CIT in August 2015 for $3.4 billion, more than double the initial investment for IndyMac, and left CIT management in March 2016 as part of a shake-up.
The new disclosures don't precisely match what a bank would disclose in a proxy filing. For one, they cover more than just a one-year period. Nor do they break down what Mr. Mnuchin was paid as chief executive and what he received when he moved to his other role. A small portion may be fees for serving as a CIT director after he left the vice chairman role.
Prorating the disclosed amount to an annual basis indicates Mr. Mnuchin would have earned about $4.5 million in wages and incentive compensation. That figure is in line with his target compensation for 2015, 2016 and 2017 as detailed in the OneWest merger agreement with CIT.
That is more than the pay of a typical chief executive at a bank around the size of OneWest, which had $23 billion in assets when it was sold. Such CEOs earned a median $3.7 million in compensation in 2015, according to consulting firm Compensation Advisory Partners.
In the earlier disclosure covering just five months of 2015, CIT had said Mr. Mnuchin was paid $1.3 million in wages and incentive pay. He also received $5.2 million to settle a so-called tax-gross-up obligation related to stock options, and $10.9 million in severance.
The so-called tax gross-up, where the bank agreed to give Mr. Mnuchin money to help cover tax payments, and large severance package--both previously disclosed--are unusual items for a public-company executive, compensation consultants said. Tax gross-up payments are ""a waning practice"" at public companies because they are ""viewed unfavorably"" by shareholders, said Eric Hosken, partner at Compensation Advisory Partners.
The payment was agreed to by OneWest, which was privately held, before the firm's sale and the bank had reserved for it, CIT said in a filing last year.
Over all, the amount Mr. Mnuchin got from OneWest and CIT as shown in the earlier and latest disclosures is high, compensation consultant Alan Johnson said. ""For a $23-billion bank, that's a lot of money,"" he said.
Fed Sends BB&T Cease-and-Desist Order Over Anti-Money-Laundering Issues By Katy Burne and Rachel Louise Ensign
The Federal Reserve said Friday that it had issued a cease-and-desist order to BB&T Corp. over alleged deficiencies in its anti-money-laundering controls, rounding out the latest regulatory action against the bank for recent failures in that area.
The cease-and-desist order, which is on the more severe end of the Fed's enforcement scale, means the bank must show it is complying with anti-money-laundering rules until the central bank removes or otherwise modifies the order.
The Fed's action, which came with the firm's consent, followed another supervisory action issued to BB&T, based in Winston-Salem, N.C., last year by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and North Carolina Commissioner of
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 181 of 1177

Banks. That order also came with the bank's consent. BB&T, which had $219.3 billion in assets as of Dec. 31, disclosed the likely consent order with the Fed in a December securities filing.
Brian Davis, a BB&T spokesman, said the firm has a ""long history of quickly addressing regulatory concerns,"" and has already made ""significant enhancements"" to its anti-money laundering compliance program. He said the firm is ""committed to working alongside our regulatory partners to implement the needed improvements as quickly as possible.""
Such orders don't state that the bank has laundered money, but rather that their internal systems for detecting criminal activity and reporting it to the government are deemed unsound by regulators. The policing of such violations has become more severe since the financial crisis.
The Fed's order, taken Wednesday with mutual agreement by the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks, follows a recent inspection by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, which said it had identified gaps in BB&T's anti- money-laundering controls.
It requires BB&T to adopt measures to reassure the Fed and other regulators that it is taking corrective steps. These steps include submitting written plans within 60 days to ensure enhanced oversight of the controls by the firm's board of directors, and progress reports at the end of each quarter.
The Fed's order said BB&T had to adopt ""a firm-wide compliance risk management program designed to ensure compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to anti-money laundering, including compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act.""
The bank has been one of the few acquisitive large banks, and the consent order likely halts its mergers-and- acquisitions appetite. Banks generally can't acquire other lenders when they are under such an order, though Chief Executive Kelly King said on BB&T's recent earnings call that the bank could still do nonbank deals like buying firms in the insurance industry.
A number of other regional banks are also under consent orders. The orders themselves, and the elevated costs for compliance systems and personnel to deal with them, often drag on longer than banks expect.
WSJ Pro: EU Officials Wait to See How Trump Will Approach Financial Regulation Before Acting on New Rules By Julia-Ambra Verlaine
BRUSSELS--European Union finance officials are waiting to see how U.S. President Donald Trump will approach financial regulation before agreeing to finalize post-crisis rules proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.
The international standards setter was supposed to complete new rules around global bank capital requirements in January, but unexpectedly postponed a key meeting at the beginning of the month.
The body in its announcement didn't attribute the delay to the U.S. presidential election, instead saying it needed more time to consider the potential impact of rules on banks. But European Union officials and bankers said uncertainty around the future of regulation in the U.S. had a part to play.

""I can understand and empathize with the committee to wait a little bit--once the dust settles they could take a more longer-term decision,"" Malta's Finance Minister Edward Scicluna told reporters Friday, ahead of a meeting of EU finance ministers.
Mr. Trump during his political campaign vowed to overhaul rules around banks. On Thursday, Mr. Trump raised the issue in remarks at a retreat for House Republicans, saying, ""We will also pursue financial reform that will help striving Americans get the credit they need to realize their dreams."" At the same retreat, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said legislation to alleviate regulation on the financial sector would be a priority.
Negotiations around rules to safeguard banks and prevent another too-big-to-fail scenario, such as the downfall of Lehman Brothers, leave in place for now regulatory uncertainty for European banks.
The main roadblock in the Basel III changes has been a debate around the so-called output floor, which would set a strict limit on the amount of flexibility banks have in evaluating their risk--and therefore how much capital they must put aside to cushion potential losses.
EU financial services chief, Valdis Dombrovskis, said the the bloc was waiting for the U.S. administration to explain its priorities so negotiations could advance.
""At this stage we don't have any concrete indications from the new U.S administration,"" Mr. Dombrovskis said after the EU ministerial meeting.
""From the EU side we are ready to work towards an agreement--there was clear consensus for this in today's [meeting].""
He added that he couldn't say when final standards might be agreed.
Mr. Dombrovskis, who is half a year into his role as head of financial services at the EU's executive arm, the European Commission, said capital requirements for European banks could increase significantly if the floor was set too high.
""We want to reach an agreement without harming Europe's economic recovery,"" he said. ""Given the fact that the agreement will shape aspects of banking regulation for the years to come it is important to concentrate on getting the agreement right."".
Former Goldman Employee Alleges Co-Workers Knew of Plans to Get Fed Secrets By Katy Burne
A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. associate has alleged that three of the firm's current employees knew in 2014 about his illegal efforts to get secrets from the Federal Reserve, according to new legal documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
The former employee, Rohit Bansal, in 2015 pleaded guilty in a Manhattan federal district court to misappropriating confidential information about a midsize bank the Fed supervised, and which Goldman was advising at the time. He was sentenced to two years' probation. He also received a lifetime ban from banking from the Fed.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 183 of 1177

The Fed referred to that midsize bank client in previous legal filings as ""Bank A,"" but the new legal documents-- related to an enforcement action against a former Goldman managing director--indicate it was New York Community Bancorp, based in Westbury, N.Y. One of the documents names an employee of ""Bank A,"" and that employee worked for New York Community Bancorp at the time of the theft of the information, according to the bank's annual reports.
Patrick Quinn, counsel to New York Community Bancorp, said, ""The entire matter is subject to a confidentiality order,"" and declined to comment further.
Before joining Goldman in the summer of 2014, Mr. Bansal had worked for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A 2015 order from the New York State Department of Financial Services said the New York Fed asked him to resign after he was caught falsifying records. Mr. Bansal's take on the matter wasn't detailed in the order. Scott Morvillo, Mr. Bansal's lawyer, had no immediate comment.
In filings from previous legal proceedings, Mr. Bansal was accused of getting secrets about ""Bank A"" from a Fed employee on Sept. 23, 2014, at a dinner at Peter Luger Steak House in Brooklyn, N.Y., and emailing the information to a Goldman managing director, Joseph Jiampietro, later the same night.
Goldman said it fired Messrs. Bansal and Jiampietro after it learned of the events and settled civil charges brought separately against it by the Fed and the New York State Department of Financial Services, for $36.3 million and $50 million, respectively.
Mr. Bansal is now a witness for the Fed in a civil enforcement action it is pursuing against Mr. Jiampietro. The Fed accuses Mr. Jiampietro of asking Mr. Bansal to get Fed secrets for use in presentations to clients seeking their business. It also has accused Mr. Jiampietro of related misconduct going back to 2012 and is seeking to fine him $337,500.
Preliminary witness lists in Mr. Jiampietro's case reveal Mr. Bansal said in a 2016 deposition that four other Goldman executives had direct knowledge of conversations about him obtaining confidential Fed materials. Three of them still work for Goldman; a fourth is no longer employed by the firm.
The deposition isn't public, but some of its contents are referenced in the witness lists, which circulated between the Fed's enforcement counsel and Mr. Jiampietro's lawyers in December.
The Fed hasn't accused the four current and former Goldman employees of any wrongdoing, and their names don't appear on the Fed's preliminary witness list, indicating it doesn't anticipate calling them to testify. Darren Gersh, a Fed spokesman, declined to comment.
Goldman said it stands by the employees--managing directors Phil Labbe and Scott Romanoff; Pratik Pareek, a vice president; and a former employee, Rajat Agarwal, who was a vice president at the time of the events. All four are on the witness list for Mr. Jiampietro's defense.
A spokesman for the bank, Michael DuVally, said in a statement that Messrs. Bansal and Jiampietro, the ""two ex- employees, whom we promptly terminated after the firm self-identified the conduct, are the only ones we believe warranted sanction or discipline.""
Mr. DuVally also said the current employees declined to comment. Attempts to reach Mr. Agarwal were
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 184 of 1177

unsuccessful.
The revelations in the deposition constitute the latest twist in the Fed's lengthy investigation of the 2014 leak that stoked concerns about close ties between the regulator and Wall Street, and of employees who move between the two in what critics have called a ""revolving door"" pattern.
The night of the steakhouse dinner, Mr. Bansal learned from his former Fed colleague about the examination rating the Fed was about to assign to ""Bank A,"" according to previous legal filings.
The Fed alleges Mr. Bansal relayed the rating information to Mr. Jiampietro the same night because Mr. Jiampietro had asked him to get it. The Fed said Mr. Jiampietro shared it with others inside Goldman the next morning.
Mr. Jiampietro's lawyers say Mr. Bansal was acting on his own. Mr. Jiampietro ""never requested Mr. Bansal obtain CSI [confidential supervisory information] from any source, never knew that he had done so, never saw any document he believed to be improperly obtained CSI, and never knowingly used improperly obtained CSI,"" his lawyer, Adam Ford of the law firm Ford O'Brien LLP, said in a legal filing.
According to a witness list compiled by the defense, Mr. Bansal testified in his 2016 deposition that in 2014, Messrs. Pareek and Agarwal attended several meetings with Messrs. Bansal and Jiampietro where confidential Fed documents were discussed and Mr. Bansal was asked by the other men to get the rating information about ""Bank A"" and other confidential documents because it would help their careers.
Mr. Bansal also testified in the deposition, according to the witness list, that Mr. Labbe attended a meeting at which Mr. Jiampietro asked Mr. Bansal to get another confidential supervisory document for use in a presentation seeking new business.
In the deposition, Mr. Bansal stated that Mr. Jiampietro planned to call Mr. Romanoff about the ""Bank A"" rating the morning after the steak dinner.
Mr. Bansal separately testified that Mr. Romanoff had asked him whether Mr. Jiampietro instructed him to get other confidential Fed documents on his second day of work, according to the witness lists.
During a Sept. 26, 2014, conference call with Goldman employees, Mr. Bansal sent other confidential documents in an email, according to the Fed enforcement order against Mr. Jiampietro. Mr. Romanoff alerted Goldman's compliance office once he recognized their confidential nature, the Fed said in its complaint against Mr. Jiampietro.
The firm launched an inquiry into the matter, and the Fed said Goldman fired Messrs. Bansal and Jiampietro in October 2014.
An initial hearing in Mr. Jiampietro's case has been scheduled for July 25. Corrections &Amplifications
Details of a 2016 deposition of Mr. Bansal were revealed in witness lists. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the deposition was from 2015. (Jan. 27, 2017)

WSJ Pro: China Strengthens Rules on Local Exchanges
SHANGHAI--China's top administrative body has tightened rules for the country's regional equity exchanges, a month after a high-profile default on private placement bonds sold on Alibaba's fintech affiliate.
Each province will be allowed to set up only one local equity exchange. Mergers will be mandated in provinces that have more than one exchange, according to a statement posted on the State Council website on Thursday.
Issuance and transfer of private placement bonds will be banned, while eligible retail investors must hold at least 500,000 yuan ($72,606) in assets. Investors can buy or sell the securities only after at least five trading sessions have passed since the initial transaction, according to the State Council.
""Regional equity exchange markets belong to the private equity market, thus public issuance of securities is not allowed according to China's securities law,"" said the statement.
At the end of 2016, China had 40 regional equity exchanges where 17,400 listed firms had raised a total of around 287.1 billion yuan, according to the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the country's securities regulator. Intended to help finance China's cash-hungry smaller enterprises, these regional equity exchanges have been prone to financial risks due to a murky regulatory system, said a spokesperson from the CSRC Thursday.
Last month, a default on Cosun Group's private placement bonds sold through Ant Financial's online platform rippled through the investment community, highlighting how less-sophisticated investors could be exposed to risks.

Yellen to Testify Before Senate Banking Panel Feb. 14
By Kate Davidson
Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen will deliver her semiannual monetary policy report to the Senate Banking Committee on Feb. 14, a panel spokeswoman confirmed Friday.
Ms. Yellen will also testify before the House Financial Services Committee on Feb. 15, a spokesman for that committee said this week. The so-called Humphrey-Hawkins hearings--a reference to the 1978 law that requires them--will be Ms. Yellen's first appearance before Congress since the Fed raised interest rates a quarter percentage point in December.
Fed officials will meet again next week, but investors widely expect they will hold rates steady. Ms. Yellen said last week she doesn't see the U.S. economy at risk of overheating, a sign that officials are sticking with their plan to raise rates gradually in the months ahead.
Citigroup, European Banks Stick With Mexico as Trade War Looms
By Christina Rexrode in New York and Jeannette Neumann in Madrid
Big American and European banks with substantial interests in Mexico are standing fast with plans for further
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 186 of 1177

investment in that country even as trade-war talk heats up with the U.S.
Citigroup Inc. and Spain's Banco Santander SA and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA said they remain confident in their businesses in Mexico, where they control the country's top three banks. Executives have also said in recent days that while a trade war could hurt Mexico's economy, further peso weakness could make the country even more competitive globally.
""Mexico does have a lot of advantages, and those advantages as an economy would continue no matter what would happen between trade with the U.S.,"" Citigroup finance chief John Gerspach said Thursday during a call with debt investors. ""A weakening peso would again give them even more of a competitive edge.""
Citigroup owns one of Mexico's biggest banks, known as Citibanamex, and a month before the U.S. election said it planned to invest $1 billion in the country over four years to improve and refurbish operations. ""We're on pace to keep that going,"" Mr. Gerspach said of Citibanamex, which generated about 15% of Citigroup's consumer revenue in the fourth quarter.
Speaking after Santander reported fourth-quarter results Wednesday, Executive Chairman Ana Boti?n said the bank plans to move ahead with a 15 billion-peso investment announced in December to modernize bank branches, ATMs and information-technology systems during the next three years. Santander owns another of Mexico's largest banks and generates about a tenth of its net profit in that country.
""We expect to continue to do well in Mexico despite a more challenging environment,"" Ms. Boti?n said.
BBVA, which owns Mexico's largest bank, BBVA Bancomer SA, has more at stake, generating about half its net income in the country.
""In the short term, Mexico will have to cope with great challenges, but Mexico will overcome the current situation,"" BBVA Chairman Francisco Gonza?lez told The Wall Street Journal in a statement. ""Gradually policies should evolve in the right direction"" between Mexico and the U.S., he added.
For their part, investors are showing some concern but aren't selling indiscriminately. Citigroup shares have outperformed the S&P 500 since the U.S. election but have trailed the KBW Nasdaq Bank index by about 10 percentage points.
BBVA shares have lost nearly 2% since the election versus a nearly 18% gain for the Euro Stoxx Banks index. Meanwhile, Santander stock has actually outpaced the index, rising about 21% since Nov. 8.
The growing war of words between President Donald Trump and Mexico has taken a toll on the peso--it has lost about 14% of value against the dollar since Nov. 8--and raises the prospect of an economic slowdown or even recession in that country.
Given all three foreign banks' operations are focused primarily on retail and commercial banking, the lenders' profits in Mexico are closely tied to domestic demand for mortgages, consumer and business loans. And while a weaker peso could increase competitiveness, it poses a short-term headwind for the banks.
Fourth-quarter net profit at Santander's Mexico business rose 14% from a year earlier measured in pesos. But for purposes of the bank as a whole, it fell 2.3% when translated back into euros. BBVA reports fourth-quarter results

Wednesday.
Santander and BBVA executives say confidence in their ability to juggle the uncertainty in Mexico derives in part from experience managing businesses in other emerging markets. Santander has a major bank in Brazil and BBVA in Turkey.
Citigroup also has a long history in emerging markets. Speaking on his bank's earnings call earlier this month, Chief Executive Michael Corbat noted Citigroup has served customers around the world ""through wars, through trade wars, through depressions, through recessions.""
Still, Mexico could prove disruptive for Citigroup if, say, President Trump opts to abandon the North American Free Trade Agreement. Some investors and analysts have in the past called on the bank to sell the Mexico operations, which were rocked by a loan-loss scandal in 2014. Scrapping Nafta, or a severe recession in Mexico, could rekindle such debate.
For now, the bank isn't changing course. Asked on Citigroup's earnings call if the bank would consider selling the Mexico business, Mr. Gerspach replied: ""No. That's not even on the table."" And Citigroup directors spent only a few minutes discussing Mexico at a board meeting in recent days, according to people familiar with the matter.
How the Mexico-U.S. trade dispute plays out, especially as it relates to the country's economy and remittances to people living there, will prove important to Citigroup and its growth prospects.
About 24% of Citibanamex's corporate loans are to companies in Mexican states along the U.S. border, which presumably would be most hurt by a more restrictive trade policy, Goldman Sachs analysts estimate based on data from Mexico bank regulators. As well, Mexico accounts for, on average, 10% of Citigroup's revenue from continuing operations, more than any market except the U.S.
Citibanamex also hosts more than 27 million consumer accounts, about half of Citigroup's total and more than two and a half times the bank's number of U.S. ones.
Of course, U.S.-Mexico relations could improve. And some bankers even think the current situation could lead to opportunity, should Nafta be revisited or renegotiated. Jorge Mariscal, emerging market chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management, said there are a number of banking issues that Nafta doesn't address, but that have been sore points for years.
For example, a new treaty could allow Mexican collateral to be used for U.S. dollar loans or make it easier for banks to have cross-border banking licenses, he said.
""The rhetoric is quite concerning,"" Mr. Mariscal said. ""It's not clear if there is a constructive road ahead. But if there is, there is both risk and opportunity.""

Big Chinese Deals Stall on Capital-Outflows Clampdown By Kane Wu and Julie Steinberg
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 188 of 1177

The pace of big Chinese takeovers abroad is slowing as buyers contend with rules tightening the flow of money out of the country and increased government scrutiny at home and overseas.
Bankers say many of the record-breaking $225 billion in overseas acquisitions Chinese companies announced last year are stalled by financial or regulatory hurdles--including the country's biggest-ever deal, China National Chemical Corp.'s $43 billion bid for Syngenta AG, a Swiss seed and pesticide maker. European regulators this month extended the deadline for their review of ChemChina's bid a second time, to April.
More Chinese acquirers are backing out of deals. While Chinese firms announced more than double the amount of overseas acquisitions last year versus the previous, the value of deals withdrawn in 2016 was up around sevenfold, to $38.39 billion, according to Dealogic. The average number of days it took a Chinese buyer to complete an overseas deal in 2016 edged upward throughout the year, with November and December notching the highest levels, at above 140 days, according to Dealogic.
A major factor behind the slowdown: stricter policing of overseas acquisitions by Chinese regulators to curb a flood of money leaving the country.
The resulting uncertainty about regulatory approvals has damped some investors' enthusiasm for overseas deals. ""It is unmistakable that Chinese investors are far more cautious amid mounting uncertainties,"" said Fred Hu, chairman of Primavera Capital. Mr. Hu's Chinese private-equity firm is a prominent deal maker involved in last year's biggest U-turn: Anbang Insurance Group Co. dropping its $14 billion bid for Starwood Hotels &Resorts Worldwide Inc.
Mergers and acquisitions the world over go through cycles, and given the size, wealth and ambition of corporate China, financiers say the country's surge in overseas, or outbound, deals is likely not stopping, but taking a break.
Some well-connected Chinese acquirers are still striking smaller deals. Ant Financial Services Group, an affiliate of online shopping giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., clinched a deal Thursday to buy U.S. money-transfer provider MoneyGram International Inc. for $880 million. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. also agreed to sell its Dendreon cancer business to Chinese conglomerate Sanpower for $820 million earlier this month.
""In the long run, the trend of China Inc. going global should not be affected"" by the current foreign-exchange controls, said Wang Hongzhang, chairman of state lender China Construction Bank Corp., at a January event in Hong Kong. His bank offers financing for many Chinese outbound deals, including Anbang's Starwood bid.
For now, though, Chinese companies are increasingly anxious about deals abroad--particularly the biggest, which get the most scrutiny.
Chinese regulators, including the Commerce Ministry and the country's top economic-planning agency, must now clear many outbound deals larger than $1 billion, as well as everything more than $10 billion, before companies can get approval to move funds offshore, according to people with knowledge of the matter and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Regulators also are retroactively examining many pending deals that had earlier been approved, causing delays, according to people familiar with the matter.

HSBC,Low Rates Boost Allure of Preferreds, Jan 30"," 2017""",1,"IN THIS ERA OF VERY LOW INTEREST RATES, some investors have turned to preferred securities, many of which yield in the neighborhood of 6%. That's certainly a lot better than the S&P 500's recent average yield of 2.1% and the 10-year U.S. Treasury note's 2.52%.
Of these securities, preferred stocks are the most common, but other preferreds include hybrid securities and small-denomination ""baby"" bonds. All have a lot in common with fixed-income. Like bonds, preferreds often pay a fixed coupon, though in some cases it can be reset. Most are callable, meaning the issuer can redeem them on a specified date. Unlike common stocks, preferreds don't come with voting rights. However, dividends of preferreds are paid before common dividends, because they are higher up in the capital structure-an advantage if the underlying company has financial problems or liquidates.
It's important to point out, however, that preferred securities aren't bulletproof, their tantalizing yields notwithstanding.
One of their risks is sector concentration. Banks, which under regulatory pressure have been rebuilding their capital positions since the financial crisis of 2007-09, are by far the biggest issuer of preferreds. Another potential worry is rising interest rates, which can pressure any security that pays a fixed coupon, regardless of whether it's a 30-year Treasury bond or a preferred stock.
And it's important to note that not all preferred securities make payments that are considered qualified dividend income. That contrasts with common stocks, whose dividends are treated as such, provided a minimum holding period is achieved. Qualified dividend income is taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. So, investors need to check on the tax treatment of specific preferred securities.
Douglas Baker, who's managed the $2.6 billion Nuveen Preferred Securities fund (ticker: NPSAX) for 10 years, calls preferreds ""an attractive addition to a portfolio, due to their income and diversification potential."" He says they have relatively low correlations with other assets, including common stocks, high-yield bonds, and investment- grade bonds.
Five of the fund's holdings are shown in the accompanying table. The fund's yield is about 5.6%, and its 10-year annual return of 6.05% places it in the top quarter of its Morningstar peer group.
Baker divides preferreds into two buckets: those geared to retail investors and that typically have a par value of $25, and those mainly favored by institutions and typically having a par value of $1,000.
The market's bifurcated structure can create opportunities, he says, because ""retail and institutional investors don't necessarily price in the risk of the asset class similarly."" Retail investors seeking yield have bid up prices, in many cases, making overall valuations in their part of the market less attractive.
Generally speaking, he continues, the two investor bases have different priorities, with the retail segment particularly interested in yield lately. Institutional buyers, Baker observes, analyze ""the income part of it, but they will also focus on things like spreads"" versus other credits, such as mortgages or corporate bonds.
As of Dec. 30, about 75% of the Nuveen fund's holdings were in the institutional part of the market, partly owing to valuations. Adding to the institutional market's allure is that it has a lot more preferred securities whose coupons
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 199 of 1177
reset, a good hedge against rising rates-and a big consideration, with the Federal Reserve having upped rates in December for the second time in 12 months. Securities whose coupons can reset at some point account for 82% of the Nuveen fund, providing some protection when rates are increasing.
But even if rates do continue to go up, it isn't necessarily a major head wind for financial stocks, at least in the short run. ""There are two sides of the interest-rate coin. If rates do increase, fundamentally the sector that's going to benefit the most is likely the bank sector,"" says Baker.
For many banks, higher rates help the spread between what they earn on their assets, notably loans, and what they pay on liabilities, including deposits. And higher rates can signal strong economic growth.
Another note of caution about preferreds: The institutional securities are typically traded over the counter, not on exchanges, making it hard for retail investors to access them directly and efficiently. Hence, an actively managed mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund often makes more sense for an individual investor interested in the institutional segment.
Another option is the iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF (PFF), which has nearly $17 billion of assets. As of Dec. 30, its 12-month trailing yield was 5.85%. Eight of its top 10 holdings are securities issued by financial firms, including Wells Fargo (WFC) and HSBC Holdings (HSBC). The fund tracks the S&P U.S. Preferred Stock Index.
Even if a preferred offers a juicy yield, there's a related danger: When rates are low, it makes economic sense for the issuer to call a high-yielding security, and replace it by issuing paper yielding less.
A hypothetical example: Say a preferred stock trades at $27.50 a share, 10% above its par price of $25.00, and pays a coupon of 7%. With the price at $27.50, the yield would be a little more than 6%$1.75 divided by the stock price. But if the bond is called in the near future at $25, the investor could lose that premium on the price. ""All of a sudden, you have to factor in a loss of 10 bond points into your total-return calculation,"" says Baker.
One reason these securities have been so popular among banks is that they help bolster their regulatory capital, something that's carefully watched these days. ""We love the fact that the banks have raised a lot of capital,"" he comments. ""That makes them safer.""

HSBC,Why Palladium Rally Can Last," Jan 30, 2017",1,"AFTER A BIG RALLY IN 2016, PALLADIUM PRICES ARE SURGING AGAIN. DESPITE THE run-up, investors say there are still plenty of reasons to buy the volatile metal.
Prices for palladium are up 8.1% since the beginning of the year, outperforming every precious metal but platinum. The rally comes after a nearly 21% gain last year. Investors can invest directly in the metal through the ETFS Physical Palladium Shares exchange-traded fund (ticker: PALL). Palladium for April delivery closed at $738.60 a troy ounce on Friday.
Driving the gains are expectations that an economic recovery in the U.S. and China will lift car sales, boosting demand for the precious metal, which is a key component in auto-exhaust filters. The auto industry accounts for 80% of total palladium demand, making it a crucial factor in determining the metal's price.
Car sales in China, the world's largest market, rose at their fastest pace in three years in 2016, helped by a popular tax incentive for buyers. U.S. sales rose for a seventh straight year to a new annual record. Both the U.S. and China use palladium in their catalytic converters. European cars use platinum. Overall, the global auto industry grew by 4% last year, estimates UBS Wealth Management.
That growth is likely to continue in 2017. UBS expects sales to get a boost from Brazil and Russia, whose economies are emerging from recession, even while sales in China flag as Beijing trims last year's tax break. More stringent emission regulations in North America, China, and India will require that more palladium be put into catalytic converters, buoying demand, the bank says.
Some investors also expect U.S. car sales to get a boost from fiscal stimulus launched by President Donald Trump,
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 202 of 1177
who has pledged to increase infrastructure spending and push through tax cuts. ""There were some expectations that U.S. demand would flatten out this year,"" says James Steel, a strategist at HSBC. ""If tax cuts or fiscal stimulus boost the economy, that would be good for auto demand and good for palladium.""
Prices for the metal rallied in the days leading up to Trump's inauguration, and jumped after the president urged auto company CEOs to keep production in the U.S.
Analysts also expect supplies of the metal to remain scarce in 2017. Mine production in South Africa, the world's biggest supplier of palladium, is unlikely to rise much from last year, while Russian stockpiles appear to be depleted, TD Securities has noted. The firm expects global demand to outstrip supply by 1.2 million ounces this year, up from a 632,000-ounce mismatch in 2016.
To be sure, some experts believe that palladium could be a dangerous bet in the wake of its big rally. While economic growth in the U.S. could stimulate demand, it also risks pushing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at a faster pace. Higher rates, in turn, tend to lift the dollar. A stronger U.S. currency puts pressure on commodity prices, which are denominated in dollars and become more expensive to foreign buyers when the buck rises.
Others believe there is not much room for demand to grow in the U.S., as the car market nears saturation and the economy approaches full employment.

Alibaba Group Holding »baba-nyse Buy *Price $98.41 on Jan. 23
by HSBC
The wide-ranging global online-commerce company, based in China, supports retail and wholesale transactions, travel planning and reservation services, subscriptionand platform-based software, cloudcomputing services, and a wide array of media, among other offerings. For the past several quarters, it has predicted that rising mobile traffic, higher user engagement, and its immense data resources will drive strong revenue growth in its core business, despite moderating growth in its gross merchandise volume, or GMV. December-quarter (fiscal third- quarter 2017) results provided evidence that this strategy is playing out.
In particular, retail revenue in China grew 42% year over year, to 41 billion renminbi [about $6 billion], a two percentage-point acceleration from fiscal secondquarter 2017. Advertising revenue increased 47% year over year and 66% quarter over quarter, as a greater number of users spent more time on the Taobao [mainly consumer-to- consumer] app and clicked on increasingly relevant ads. Commission revenue grew 32% Y/Y, reflecting strong GMV growth on Tmall [Alibaba's chief retailer-to-consumer marketplace].
Management is also exploiting other growth drivers among its businesses. Cloud revenue, for example, grew 115% Y/Y, to RMB1.8 billion. Its digital media businesses, including Youku [which is akin to YouTube], will be another growth driver as it cross-sells its 443 million annual active buyers on subscriptions to premium, exclusively digital, content.
We use a sum-of-the-parts approach to value Alibaba, which results in a target price of $125. And, because we see implied upside near 27%, we maintain our Buy rating.

Neutral *Price $76.05 on Jan. 24 by Credit Suisse
The maker of chemicals and other products for agriculture, health-care, electronics, and industrial markets, among others, posted a fourth-quarter 2016 earnings per share of 51 cents, well ahead of our 40 cents and the Street consensus of 41 cents; core earnings were only modestly better than expectations. That said, we view core operating results as yet another solid quarter of execution, with the company winding up 2016 $20 million ahead in its $730 million cost-cutting goal.
Our 2017/18 estimates are unchanged at $3.60 and $4, respectively. We are also raising our price target to $76 from $70. While the bears may highlight the light first-quarter 2017 earnings guidance (of $1.37 versus the prior estimate of $1.45), we believe that long-term investors will focus on the positive commentary surrounding incremental cost-cut potential. Key to that will be the timing of its pending merger with Dow Chemical (DOW), which DuPont now expects will happen in first-half 2017.

We are downgrading to Neutral from Buy and reducing our fair value estimate to $27 from $36. Mattel's turnaround story has lost momentum as it pushed up its fourthquarter earnings release and last night revealed disappointing year-end results.
Multiple factors contributed to the performance, including a slower-thanexpected retail environment, fewer product reorders, and increased promotional activity. Furthermore, several issues will continue into 2017 (and beyond), such as foreign-exchange head winds, rising input costs, and an unfavorable product mix. As such, the ability to exceed a 15% operating margin is now pushed out into 2019.

HSBC,Standard Chartered Takes Aim at Mature Markets; The bank wants to win business from U.S. companies looking to expand in emerging markets," Feb 1, 2017",0,"Standard Chartered PLC has a new market in its sights after 150 years financing trade across Asia, India and Africa: the U.S.
The London-based bank may be best known in the U.S. for regulatory run-ins over transactions with customers in Iran and other sanctioned countries . But its new head of corporate and institutional banking, Simon Cooper, wants to win business from U.S. companies looking to expand in Asia, Africa and other emerging markets where Standard Chartered is a major operator.
The country has ""many, many clients we've just never spoken to before,"" Mr. Cooper said in a recent interview. Last year, he and his management team met dozens of customers to find out how they felt about the bank. The broader Americas region has been ""underrepresented"" within Standard Chartered, Mr. Cooper said.
In October, it hired Torry Berntsen as chief executive and head of corporate and institutional banking for the Americas region, with a mandate to hire some more people there, Mr. Cooper said.
Recent wins include helping a big American coffee chain in China convert yuan back to dollars, and guiding a U.S. e-commerce business into Africa.
Right now, the Americas is Standard Chartered's smallest revenue-producer in a geographic breakdown. Loans to clients in the Americas were around $11.5 billion at the bank at the end of 2015. In the greater China region including Hong Kong, they were $77.7 billion.
The move to tap more mature markets--Mr. Cooper said border-crossing European companies also represent a big opportunity--comes as Standard Chartered is reducing risk in some racier parts of the world. The bank lent billions of dollars to entrepreneurs and businesses in India and Hong Kong, then paid the price when some of the
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 208 of 1177
businesses teetered in the commodities slowdown. Since the end of 2014, its commodities exposure has been cut by one third, to $37 billion at the end of June 2016.
Mr. Cooper was hired by Chief Executive Bill Winters last April to help get Standard Chartered back on track after years of overexpansion. He inherited a division that had grown too far too fast, fueled by cheap money pouring into Asia and relationships with a handful of large but risky customers. But cutting loose big clients has meant losing revenue too, something analysts say Standard Chartered can ill afford to do.
Standard Chartered runs the risk of being too concentrated in certain regions, said Chirantan Barua, a banking analyst at Bernstein Research. Expanding the focus on clients in the U.S. and other developed markets is ""a diversification strategy that makes a lot of sense,"" he said, that will enable the bank to bring developed players to emerging markets and not just other way around.
Mr. Cooper, 49, joined the bank after a 26-year career at larger rival HSBC Holdings PLC. There, he gained a reputation for being ambitious, decisive and blunt. From a start in corporate finance, he took a traditional path for rising HSBC managers with assignments across Asia and the Middle East. He was named a group general manager--an elite ranking within the bank--and was CEO of HSBC's Middle East and Korean arms before becoming head of global commercial banking in 2013.
He was then just one rung from the top job, held since 2011 by Stuart Gulliver. So his surprise jump to Standard Chartered was seen as an acknowledgment of the stiff competition to replace Mr. Gulliver when he steps down in the next year or two.
Now in a similar spot at Standard Chartered, and running its biggest business, Mr. Cooper is seen as a potential candidate to succeed Mr. Winters--although internal competition exists there too.
The bank also still has a series of legal and regulatory hurdles to get over, including a potential penalty from the U.S. for alleged business with customers in sanctioned countries beyond an earlier period covered by a 2012 settlement. Standard Chartered has said it is cooperating with a probe into possible historical violations.
The bank reports fourth-quarter earnings Feb. 24. Analysts say it could take years for Standard Chartered to get its returns back to acceptable levels while it cut costs and works through its problem loans. Its stock has been buoyed, though, by investors buying it as a proxy for commodities or as a hedge against the pound. Most of the bank's earnings are denominated in dollars, while its shares trade in sterling.
""We need to focus on growing revenues for this business and improving returns for our shareholders and that's the focus for this year,"" Mr. Cooper said. ""But they have to be sustainable returns. We've got to mitigate and manage the risks for both credit and financial crime as we grow.""

HSBC,"Dollar Caught Between President Trump's Tough Talk, Policy Plans; Greenback's twists and turns against the yen show how sensitive markets have become to proclamations from politicians"," Feb 2, 2017",0,"Major currencies are posting their largest swings in months, highlighting a growing difficulty for investors and traders to discern the likely path of Trump administration policy.
The U.S. currency rallied in the weeks following Donald Trump's election Nov. 8, reflecting in part investor expectations that deregulatory, tax-reduction and stimulus plans will push up U.S. growth.
But since the New Year, the dollar has declined and volatility has picked up, driven by statements by administration officials that have been interpreted by investors as advocating a lower dollar.
The remarks, from Mr. Trump and some important advisers, have surprised some investors and pushed many traders to take a more-defensive stance. Few analysts expect quick clarity on Washington policies that could settle the dollar's path, likely meaning more unpredictable trading in the months ahead.
""What markets are concerned about now is volatility,"" said Mark McCormick, head of North American FX strategy at TD Securities. ""People are staying in trades for shorter periods of time, and they're not taking as much risk.""
This week, a measure of volatility in the Japanese yen hit its highest level against the dollar since August, while volatility in the euro has recently touched its highest since July, according to Thomson Reuters.
The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, which gauges the value of the dollar against a basket of six currencies, notched daily moves of 0.5% or greater nine times in January, compared with four such moves in October. The index last month posted its largest decline since March 2016. It is down about 2.4% for 2017.
In part, the moves reflect hints, though far from definitive signals, that the administration supports a weaker currency--a stance that many economists say would conflict with policies the administration has backed that would tend to boost the dollar.
Other factors likely sowing doubt in markets include expected battles between the White House and congressional Republicans, who hold the majority on Capitol Hill, over taxes and spending. Fiscally conservative lawmakers could help stymie Mr. Trump's infrastructure plans. There is also a fight over border taxes, a policy that could further enhance the dollar's strength.
President Trump, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal last month, said the dollar was too strong compared with China's currency. Peter Navarro, head of the National Trade Council, in an interview with the Financial Times, accused Germany of exploiting the euro for competitive trade gains. The president has vowed to label China a currency manipulator, a step some economists say likely precedes new import tariffs.
While Mr. Trump seems to want a weaker dollar against some trade partner currencies, most economists agree that his economic platform could put strong upward pressure on the greenback.
""U.S. President Trump's rhetoric has been a key factor"" behind recent dollar weakness, said David Bloom, a currency strategist in HSBC Holdings PLC's Global Research department. But any administration desire for a weaker dollar ""will likely be undone by his policy mix,"" which is likely to push the dollar higher, he said.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 211 of 1177
It is hard to know whether the new administration will explicitly pursue a weaker currency, in part because its economic team still isn't in place.
Traditionally, the top spokesman in Washington on the currency is the Treasury secretary, and Mr. Trump's pick, Steven Mnuchin, hasn't been confirmed yet. In confirmation hearings, Mr. Mnuchin suggested the Trump administration would remain committed to a strong dollar over the longer term, though he acknowledged a strong dollar would harm the U.S. in the short term.
There is confusion outside the White House about whose economic views will have predominance among officials with disparate opinions.
""It doesn't seem like they have sorted out amongst themselves who's going to deliver the message and what the message is on the dollar,"" said Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former top U.S. Treasury official in the Obama administration.
The dollar's twists and turns against the yen in the past two days show how sensitive markets have become.
During U.S. trading hours Tuesday, the greenback almost fell below ¥112, hitting its lowest level in two months, after Mr. Trump accused Japan and China of persistently keeping their currencies weak.
The dollar recovered against the yen Wednesday, closing up 0.4% in U.S. trading at ¥113.252. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe hit back, saying the country's economic policy was aimed solely at raising domestic inflation, and that U.S. criticism ""about inducing a cheaper yen misses the mark.""
Mr. Trump isn't alone in saying one thing while pursuing policies that may have an opposite effect.
Japan's continuing experiment with extreme economic policies, instigated by Prime Minister Abe after his election in 2012 in a program nicknamed Abenomics, has implicitly favored a weaker yen. The hope is that will boost exporters' earnings, encouraging them to raise wages, in turn boosting inflation.
Ultimately, the jawboning by leaders will likely be overwhelmed by the force of economic fundamentals, analysts say.
While the Federal Reserve is expected to keep raising interest rates this year, major central banks from Europe to Japan will likely keep their rates ultralow to help their sluggish economies. That divergence should lead to a stronger dollar because higher rates tend to make a currency more appealing to investors seeking yield.
""Currencies are not driven by just the government,"" said Nizam Idris, head of strategy for fixed income and currencies at Macquarie Bank Ltd. in Singapore. ""The market will become numb to this eventually.""

HSBC,Private Indicator Shows Slowdown in China's Growth; Caixin China manufacturing purchasing managers index declines to 51 in January from 51.9 in December," Feb 3, 2017",1,"BEIJING--A private gauge of Chinese manufacturing activity fell in January, suggesting a loss of economic momentum in the world's second-largest economy.
The data and news of a tightening in short-term interest rates helped send markets down by more than half a percent as trading opened after the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday.
The Caixin China manufacturing purchasing managers index remained above the 50 mark separating expansion from contraction for the seventh straight month but declined to 51 in January from 51.9 in December, Caixin Media Co. and research firm Markit said Friday. Subindexes measuring output, new orders, employment and inventory all weakened last month, while the export-orders subindex rose.
On Wednesday, China's statistics agency reported that the official manufacturing PMI edged down to 51.3 in January from 51.4 in December. The official PMI tends to better reflect conditions among larger state-owned companies, while the Caixin index more closely tracks smaller private companies, economists say.
""When growth momentum weakens, we can see the Caixin number drop more quickly than the official PMI,"" said HSBC Corp. economist Ma Xiaoping. ""In the next few months, we'll likely see overall momentum moderate, although it will be gradual.""
China's economy is starting to lose steam as Beijing takes a more prudent approach on monetary policy and tightens property-market restrictions to stem speculative bubbles, economists said. China's central bank raised interest rates by .10 percentage point in its open-market operations Friday on seven-day, 14-day and 28-day instruments.
""The current growth momentum may be hard to sustain,"" said CEBM Group economist Zhengsheng Zhong in a note accompanying the release of the Caixin data. ""We must remain wary of downward pressures on the economy this year.""
But economists said any slowdown in growth is likely to be gradual, given Beijing's focus on economic and political stability in advance of an important Communist Party meeting in the autumn. They also cautioned against reading too much into a single month's data. The Caixin index tends to be more volatile than the official measure, and the Lunar New Year holiday, which started on Jan. 27 this year, often skews results as factories shut down and workers head home to celebrate.
While markets may not like the impact of tightening, which tends to push down property, commodity and other asset prices, it is a healthy development, some economists said. In recent months, speculators have driven up raw- material prices, putting pressure on factory profits, and a moderate tightening could reverse that trend.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 214 of 1177
""Over the past few quarters, coal and steel prices have gone crazy on a lot of speculation, even though oversupply is still there,"" said Commerzbank AG economist Zhou Hao. ""The big picture will be about bubble deflation this year.""
Industrial profits in December rose 2.3% year on year in December compared with a 14.5% increase in November. Mr. Zhou added that a bigger challenge facing China's manufacturing sector is the need to reassess technology, efficiency, cost and its role in the global supply chain. ""President Trump wants 'Made in America,' Germany wants 'Made in Germany,'"" he said. ""China has to figure out where it stands.""

Peru's Central Bank Expected to Keep Policy on Hold
Peru's central bank is expected to keep its reference interest rate on hold at 4.25% when it meets Thursday, Credicorp Capital says. The firm thinks the central bank's board of directors will take into account the easing of annual inflation to 3.1% last month, which is still above its target range of 1% to 3%.

Bank of Japan May Find Itself With a Dilemma
As the Bank of Japan stepped up efforts to arrest increasing government bond yields, a weaker yen as a result of the central bank's accommodative stance may rekindle U.S.-protectionist talk ahead of Friday's Trump/Abe meeting in Washington. The yen weakened Friday after the BOJ decided to ultimately buy JGBs at a fixed rate, and a Japanese brokerage house analyst says the central bank had to ""cope with the ongoing spike in the JGB yields."" But for Japanese authorities already hearing Trump comments suggesting Japan was benefiting from a weaker yen, a dollar at current levels around ¥112 to ¥113 would be easier for them to explain central-bank action isn't aimed at a weaker currency, the analyst adds.

The Bank of Japan has effectively begun to raise its target for 10-year government bond yields, says Nikko SMBC chief economist Junichi Makino. On Friday, the central bank conducted fixed-rate 10-year-debt purchases at a 0.11% yield. ""They should have set the purchase rate at 0%, but they set it"" well above that. Doing so ""was a de facto rate increase."" His interpretation, while not necessarily shared in the market, adds to signs of skepticism among investors about the BOJ's resolve to hold down long-term rates. The 10-year yield is at 0.095%.

RBI Seen Cutting Rates This Week, Followed by Extended Pause
The Reserve Bank of India will lower its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point Wednesday given inflation is expected to undershoot the 5% target for March 2017, says Naresh Takkar, chief executive of ratings firm ICRA, a unit of Moody's. However, after the rate cut, an extended pause is likely, as focus shifts to the year-later 4% inflation target. ""With greater emphasis being laid on achieving the midpoint of the inflation target range of 4.0%, we continue to expect the anticipated rate cut in February 2017 to be followed by an extended pause,"" he says.

Economists to Look for Clarity on RBI's Inflation Aim
Beyond the rate decision, economists will be watching the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy review Wednesday to know by when it hopes to see inflation come down to 4%. The central bank had previously set a March 2018 date. But its most recent policy statement didn't make any mention of the target, giving rise to questions if the target was being relaxed to favor growth. ""It may be a good idea for the central bank to provide some color on when it intends to get to the 4% inflation target,"" HSBC says. If the clarification doesn't come, HSBC says it assumes the RBI would aim for a 4% to 5% inflation range, and return to the 4% aim only when investments show surer signs of a revival.

for monetary easing is steadily shrinking, says DBS. Economist Radhika Rao says weak economic activity, global uncertainties and the fact that headline inflation stays below the central bank's target all support a rate cut. However, core inflation still is sticky. India's latest purchasing managers index readings also show a recovery in activity levels. ""Regardless of when the rate cut materializes in [the first half of 2017], it is clear that the central bank is nearing the end of the monetary easing cycle as pent-up demand and easing cash shortage lift [fiscal year 2018] growth,"" she says. ""Oil prices are also a risk, as are firm U.S. rates,"" and are likely to keep the RBI from easing aggressively, she adds.

Economists Lower Outlook for Brazil Inflation in 2017
Economists again lowered their outlook for Brazil's inflation this year, according to a weekly central-bank survey. Brazil's inflation rate, as measured by the official consumer-price index, is expected to end 2017 at 4.64%, according to the survey of 100 economists, compared with the 4.70% forecast in the previous week's survey. It was the fifth consecutive reduction. Economists maintained their inflation forecast for 2018 at 4.50%. The Selic rate is forecast to end 2017 at 9.50% and 2018 at 9%, unchanged from the prior week's projections. Last month, the central bank cut the Selic rate to 13% from 13.75%, beating analysts' expectations for a half-percentage-point reduction. The country's economic growth forecast for 2017 was reduced to 0.49% from 0.50% a week ago. For 2018, the economists expect GDP to expand 2.25%, up from 2.20% previously. Brazil is forecast to post a $46.50 billion trade surplus this year, up from $45.10 billion in the previous week's survey.

HSBC,Reckitt Benckiser to Buy Mead Johnson for $16.6 Billion; Deal will boost British company's consumer-health business and push it deeper into emerging markets," Feb 10, 2017",0,"LONDON--Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC on Friday said it agreed to buy baby-food maker Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. for $16.6 billion, a deal that will almost double the size of the British company's consumer-health business and push it deeper into emerging markets.
Reckitt, whose lineup includes Durex condoms and Scholl foot-care products, earlier this month disclosed that it was in talks with Mead after The Wall Street Journal reported on the potential deal. It will pay $90 a share in cash for the Glenview, Ill.-based company, which makes a range of nutritional products including Enfamil infant formula and the Sustagen milk supplement for children.
Including debt, the deal is valued at $17.9 billion.
The acquisition caps a yearslong search by Chief Executive Rakesh Kapoor, who lost out to Bayer AG in a bidding war for Merck &Co.'s consumer business in 2014 and has since been seeking a major acquisition.
Reckitt's growth has slowed lately, leaving the Slough, England-based company in need of a way to jump-start sales. On Friday, the company, which also has household-cleaning, personal-hygiene and food businesses,
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 219 of 1177
reported organic revenue growth of just 3% for 2016. The measure, which excludes currency effects and acquisitions and divestments, was the weakest in over a decade.
Sales have suffered from a string of issues, including a failed foot-care innovation, a scandal in South Korea that led to a Reckitt product being withdrawn and the disruption of consumer spending in India after some high-value bills were taken out of circulation.
Shares rose in early trading in London but finished down nearly 3%. Reckitt on Friday forecast 2017 organic revenue growth of 3%, which is below analyst estimates.
Mr. Kapoor said Mead Johnson meshes well with Reckitt's consumer-health portfolio, as did its acquisition of condom and foot-care brands in the past. ""Our strategy is about healthier lives and homes,"" he said. ""Their mission is about enabling healthier lives from the very beginning.""
He identified child nutrition as a solid opportunity, saying the category's sales are projected to grow by 3% to 5% over the medium to long term.
Mead Johnson had net sales of $3.7 billion in 2016, down 8%. Half the company's sales came from Asia, with 17% coming from Latin America and the rest from North America and Europe.
The deal will turn China into Reckitt's second-biggest market, increasing its emerging-markets footprint by two- thirds. The deal will also significantly boost the company's exposure to the U.S., which remains its No. 1 market. Analysts have expressed skepticism about the deal's cost-saving possibilities, saying there are few obvious synergies beyond some distribution and head-office cuts. ""This deal does have elements of desperation about it,"" Exane BNP Paribas analyst Jeff Stent said following Reckitt's initial confirmation that it was in talks to buy Mead. ""Mead has zero overlap with Reckitt.""
Reckitt said the acquisition would boost per-share earnings by a double-digit percentage by the third year after closing, a projection Mr. Stent on Friday described as ""very conservative,"" likely tied to low savings and the high cost of funding the deal. Reckitt forecast cost savings of £200 million ($249.9 million).
Investor cheered the deal when it was first broached. They saw it raising Reckitt's exposure to faster-growing, higher-margin categories in the long term; plus, Mead's struggles of late made it a good time for an approach despite the pound's decline following Brexit.
Mead's shares have fallen sharply in the past two years as the company grappled with sluggish sales in its key Asia market, and they were down 2.7% this year before news of the deal broke. In Friday trading, they were ahead 5.5% at $87.60.

HSBC,Asia Central Bank Chiefs Worry About Trump Policies; Bankers say trade protectionism risks sending U.S. interest rates higher," Feb 10, 2017",1,"Central bankers in the Asia-Pacific region issued warnings over the potential for woes stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's economic policy.
New Zealand's central bank chief on Thursday warned of a possible inflation shock in the U.S. and much higher interest rates if Mr. Trump rolls out a program of protectionist policies . Graeme Wheeler, governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, said recent comments from the Trump administration calling for higher tariffs on imports from China and Mexico would only increase prices in the U.S. and force the U.S. Federal Reserve to clamp down through tighter policy.
""It would raise inflation rates in the U.S. The Federal Reserve would need to push harder against rising inflation,"" Mr. Wheeler said Thursday, after the bank kept its benchmark rate at a record low 1.75%. Sharply rising U.S. interest rates would also strengthen the U.S. dollar, he said.
In Tokyo, meanwhile, a Bank of Japan deputy governor on Thursday said the central bank should press ahead with its current stimulus measures, signaling his caution over Mr. Trump's possible policies.
""I believe it is of utmost importance at the current phase that the bank persistently pursue powerful monetary easing,"" Hiroshi Nakaso, one of Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda's two deputies, told business leaders.
Mr. Nakaso called attention to potential hits to Japan's economy from overseas--particularly the U.S.--in addition to other troubling signs, such as Japan's stubbornly low inflation.
India's central bank, meanwhile, unexpectedly left interest rates on hold Wednesday despite an economic slowdown, with Gov. Urjit Patel citing ""the continuing uncertainty...on a full rollout of U.S. macro policies, especially on the fiscal side, where we still await clarity.""
The men's comments echo rising concern about the impact of the new U.S. president's policies on the global economy. While early enthusiasm for Mr. Trump triggered a global rally in stocks and the dollar following his election and his promises of fiscal stimulus and deregulation, optimism started to wane as the president spoke more about trade.
Mr. Trump has said his administration will negotiate better trade deals with other countries by acting bilaterally, and has also threatened to levy tariffs on some imports. One of his first moves as president was to pull the U.S. out of a 12-nation trade pact that included New Zealand, Japan and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. ""Growing protectionism poses an acute risk for Asian economies,"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC. He especially singled out the region's ""trade dependent and highly leveraged economies like Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Thailand.""
The decision was yet another sign that a global lull in inflation that has lasted for almost a decade is ending. The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to accelerate the pace of its rate increases as unemployment recedes. Eurozone inflation in January neared the European Central Bank's target of below, but close to, 2% after undershooting it for years.
New Zealand's Mr. Wheeler said a substantial U.S. stimulus package could also compound any inflation risks that were rooted in trade protectionism. Mr. Trump recently has said China, Japan and Germany devalued their currencies at the expense of U.S. trade competitiveness.
""Given the mandate of the Federal Reserve, if there was a large fiscal stimulus in the U.S., then the Federal Reserve would certainly lean against it,"" Mr. Wheeler said.
The U.S. central bank has already indicated it is likely to raise interest rates multiple times this year and next, he
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 222 of 1177
added. ""It will be interesting to see as those [fiscal] plans become clearer what happens to longer-term [U.S.] interest rates,"" Mr. Wheeler said.
Mr. Wheeler, who will step down from his post in September, said protectionist policies would trigger retaliation against the U.S. and slow global growth.
The recent rise in global trade tensions already coincides with the slowest pace of merchandise trade growth world-wide in five years, Mr. Wheeler said.
Mr. Wheeler said caution was warranted due to ""numerous uncertainties...particularly in respect of the international outlook.""

HSBC,"Investors Watch for Dollar-Yen Clues; Meeting of Trump, Abe comes amid tension over currency policy, conflicting forces"," Feb 10, 2017",0,"President Donald Trump's meeting with Japan's prime minister on Friday could rile one of the most closely watched relationships in finance: the yen and the dollar.
After Mr. Trump's election in November, the dollar surged to a 10-month high against the Japanese currency, as investors bet the new administration would boost U.S. inflation and growth. The rally prompted trend-following investors such as hedge funds to pile in, wagering the yen would fall further.
But 2017 has disappointed dollar bulls, with the yen rising 3.3% and bearish-yen positions declining sharply in recent weeks, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. More recently, tension between the U.S. and Japan over currency and trade issues has risen, with Mr. Trump last week alleging the U.S. had sat back ""like a bunch of dummies"" as both Japan and China devalue their currencies.
While the meeting Friday may not produce any blockbuster developments, the obvious tension over currency valuations and Mr. Trump's penchant for market-moving remarks are forcing investors to pay close attention.
""In the near term, political risk is the biggest thing"" for the exchange rate, said Maoko Ishikawa, foreign-exchange strategist at J.P. Morgan in Tokyo.
The dollar gained 1.2% to ¥113.26 on Thursday.
Japan and the U.S. aren't the only nations jockeying over currency issues at a time of tepid global growth and increasing political attention to the terms of trade. On Thursday, New Zealand's central bank chief, Graeme Wheeler, said a decline in his country's exchange rate was needed to keep its growth balanced.
The current climate in foreign-exchange markets resembles a ""cold war,"" Joachim Fels, global economic adviser at fund manager Pimco, said in a note this week. He said actions taken by the European, Japanese and Chinese
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 224 of 1177
central banks in the last half of 2016 contributed to the depreciation of their currencies.
Wall Street lacks a clear consensus as to where the yen goes from here. HSBC thinks the dollar will rise as high as ¥125 by the middle of 2017, believing Mr. Trump can push through the tax cuts and fiscal spending he pledged in his campaign. The firm expects the dollar to fade later in the year.
Others believe there is little room for the dollar to appreciate against the yen after a multiyear rally in which the U.S.'s currency gained more than 30% against Japan's.
UBS Wealth Management expects the gap between Japanese and U.S. rates to shrink this year, as the Bank of Japan moves closer to unwind its stimulus policies. The group expects the dollar to trade at ¥105 by year-end. The efforts of countries around the world to devalue their way to prosperity has been a focus of Mr. Trump's economic comments, both before his election and since.
For Japan and the U.S., the situation is complicated by some contradictions between their words and actions.
Mr. Abe and other Japanese officials say their priority is stoking domestic inflation, which often has been below central bankers' targets during a yearslong span of subpar growth. But analysts say it is getting hard to argue that their policies don't look like currency intervention.
One of the BOJ's key policy shifts in recent years has been to tether the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond near zero. When the yield goes too high, the central bank tends to step in to buy government bonds.
Keeping the 10-year JGB yield low is becoming costlier with the Federal Reserve expected to raise interest rates multiple times this year. As U.S. rates rise, investors seeking better returns may sell Japanese bonds and buy Treasurys, driving yields on JGBs higher and forcing Japan's central bank to buy more bonds.
That, in turn, means the difference in yields between Treasurys and JGBs could widen, putting downward pressure on the yen.
That scenario played out on Feb. 3, when the Japanese central bank was forced to boost its bond purchases by more than $6 billion after the 10-year yield spiked to a year-high of 0.150%.
Though the action plays out in government-bond markets, the policy also has the effect of weakening the yen. ""From the outside, it looks like they're manipulating the currency,"" said J.P. Morgan's Ms. Ishikawa.
There are conflicting forces for the U.S., too. Recent comments from Mr. Trump and other members of his administration suggest they don't want the dollar to get too strong.
Yet economists say Mr. Trump's plans for corporate-tax cuts and higher fiscal spending could drive U.S. inflation higher, forcing the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly. In turn, that would put upward pressure on the dollar against all currencies, including the yen.
Mr. Trump's attitude to trade is another key factor. Talk of a new border tax on imports is dollar-positive, for example, as it would likely crimp imports by U.S. companies, thus curbing their demand for foreign currencies. Adding to the confusion is a lack of clarity over the timing and extent of any trade measures by the Trump administration--and how other countries will respond.

HSBC,"As 'Frexit' Jitters Shake French Debt, Most Investors Stay Calm; Despite worry about risk France might leave the euro, Paris stock market has performed well this year"," Feb 10, 2017",1,"French government bonds are selling off on worries that a possible Marine Le Pen win in national elections could lead France to pull out of the euro, but investors in other markets seem less concerned.
The gap between German and French government bond yields climbed to a four-year high this week , but French corporate credit and equity markets have stayed mainly calm this year, while the euro has appreciated against the dollar.
The disconnect suggests either fears in the government bond market are overblown, or that credit and equity investors have a long way to catch up if investors start to sense Ms. Le Pen could pull off another populist upset in one of the world's biggest economies.
Most analysts, investors and polls predict that Ms. Le Pen--leader of France's anti-immigrant, anti-European National Front party--won't win in spring elections.
""There's clearly political risk ahead in France, and the French [equity] market doesn't necessarily look priced for it,"" said Karen Olney, European equity strategist at UBS. Italian equities were cheap ahead of the country's December referendum on constitutional reform, but the French market still trades in line with the rest of Europe, she said.
The VSTOXX index of eurozone equity volatility, known as Europe's ""fear gauge,"" has picked up slightly this week to a level of around 18, but remains well below its high of 35.5 last June at the time of the British referendum to leave the European Union. France's benchmark CAC-40 stock index is up 1.5% so far this month, better than the 1.2% gain in the Euro Stoxx 50 index of blue chip European stocks.
Corporate bonds prices are steady too, with yields for domestically focused firms moving largely in sync with their international peers. French companies most exposed to a local economic shock like France leaving the euro are those reliant on the domestic market for much of their revenue.
Bouygues SA, the French conglomerate whose activities span construction and telecoms, and supermarket operator Carrefour SA make 62% and 47% of their revenue in France respectively, according to FactSet. Yields on bonds maturing in 2020 issued by each company have risen by 0.24 and 0.2 of a percentage point respectively in the past six months.
That is little different to similar bonds from international French companies like liquor supplier Pernod Ricard SA and health-care company Sanofi SA, which make less than 10% of their revenue in France.
Sentiment in corporate-credit markets across Europe appears relaxed, unlike during the 2010 to 2012 eurozone sovereign-debt crisis, when concerns that Greece's troubles would undermine the single currency sparked a steep selloff in credit.
Anglo-Dutch consumer giant Unilever sold a euro-denominated bond on Wednesday that was priced with a yield lower than French government debt of a similar duration.
Corporate bonds were similarly priced during the sovereign-debt crisis, when bonds issued by large energy and utilities firms yielded less than their governments.
""The disconnect between [government bonds] and credit means there is room for French credit to widen, even
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 227 of 1177
before allowing for the likely pre-election nervousness,"" HSBC said in a research note.
Some investors believe that the corporate credit market may have some catching up to with the government bond market.
""If you're a foreign owner and you just want to avoid the blowups this year, what's the point of running political risk?"" said Chris Telfer, a credit portfolio manager at ECM Asset Management.
""Everyone you speak to is certain that Le Pen won't actually get there, but people are once bitten twice shy,"" he said, referring to Britain's surprise vote to leave the EU and the election of Donald Trump as U.S. President last November.
In currency markets, the euro is up 1.2% against the dollar so far this year, suggesting the common currency isn't priced for a major political upset.
""People aren't really worried by a short or even medium-run risk of a euro breakup, that is definitely not on the agenda,"" said Bastien Drut, strategist at Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager.
There are some signs of uncertainty, however. Three-month risk reversal skews--a trading strategy used to hedge currency risk--for the euro-dollar pair fell to minus 2.2% Wednesday, suggesting some investors are protecting themselves against a fall in the common currency.
These indications of stress are still small compared with currency concerns before Brexit, where three-month risk reversals for the sterling-dollar rate plunged to below minus 6%.
Brexit and the U.S. election also taught investors to be wary of polls. Opinion polls regularly indicate that Ms. Le Pen will lose in the second round of the vote, but burned by the aftermath of the U.S. and U.K. votes, some investors are skeptical about the accuracy of polling.
Their concerns are being reflected in the government bond market.
""We've had two votes, Brexit and the U.S. election, which have shown there should be a significant risk premium,"" said Antoine Bouvet, European rates strategist at Mizuho International.
""The tools we have to measure the outcomes are imperfect at best, and that is enough to keep away some investors,"" he added.

HSBC,"Border Tax Could Upend Global Markets, but Investors Shy Away From Any Bets; Dollar could rise by 25% and oil to $65, economists say, under President Trump's proposed policy"," Feb 12, 2017",1,"A Republican tax plan has analysts predicting seismic shifts in global markets, from a double-digit surge in U.S. oil prices to the strongest dollar since the 1980s. But so far, few investors are willing to bet on it.
Markets are struggling to size up the far-reaching impact of the so-called border adjustment, which would tax imports at a rate of 20% while exempting exports. The aim is to make the U.S. a more attractive place for businesses to invest, while also raising $1 trillion to offset Republicans' proposed tax-cut plans.
Markets face big changes if the proposal becomes law. The dollar could rally by 25% to levels not seen since the 1980s, according to economists including Harvard University's Martin Feldstein. U.S. oil prices could surge to $65 a barrel from a recent $54, Goldman Sachs analysts project, reflecting a sharp tightening in the supply-demand balance in the U.S. market. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the personal-consumption- expenditures price index, could jump to 2.4% or higher from a recent 1.6%, by Goldman's estimate.
""The border tax is the biggest policy story in years,"" said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign-exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets.
Yet investors have been hesitant to bet on these moves, in part reflecting significant uncertainty over whether a border adjustment will become law or what form it might take. The proposal has faced criticism from both U.S. companies and politicians in recent weeks. Republican lawmaker Kevin Brady, one of the architects of the proposal, has said he is listening to objections and looking at ways to smooth the transition for taxpayers.
Goldman Sachs analysts said last month that pricing in global oil markets reflected just a 9% chance of the border
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 232 of 1177
adjustment becoming law.
President Donald Trump has expressed concern about the tax plan, calling it ""too complicated"" in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in January. The administration has since said a border adjustment is one option for paying for Mr. Trump's proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, but skepticism remains on Wall Street.
""The tax doesn't seem to be on the first round of the administration's priorities,"" said Alvise Marino, a foreign- exchange strategist at Credit Suisse.
On Thursday, Mr. Trump said he would make an announcement that would be ""phenomenal in terms of tax"" within the next three weeks.
Still, uncertainty over tax policy has weighed on the dollar, which has fallen 2% this year against a basket of major peers, relinquishing roughly half its postelection rally.
The border tax is expected to boost the dollar because U.S. companies, now exempt from taxes on their exports, would be able to sell more products abroad. When foreigners buy U.S. exports, they must buy the U.S. dollar and sell their local currency, driving the U.S. currency's value. At the same time, the tax could reduce U.S. appetite for foreign goods, which would curtail demand for foreign currencies and boost the dollar.
Advocates say the dollar would likely rise enough to offset the proposed tax, citing how currencies responded to similar tax systems abroad, so consumer prices would remain steady. For example: a 20% import tax on car parts made in Mexico would be met with a similar depreciation in the Mexican peso, so prices would remain stable for both importers and consumers.
But many analysts warn that these projections are based on economic theory. In the real world, the dollar likely wouldn't rise quickly or high enough to offset negative impacts.
Daragh Maher, head of U.S. foreign-exchange strategy for HSBC Holdings, said the value of the dollar and other foreign currencies is driven mostly by demand for assets such as stocks and bonds. Trade makes up only 1.4% of daily trading in the U.S. dollar, according to HSBC.
Analysts say some companies could choose to move jobs and production back to the U.S., as the import tax would temper the cost savings from outsourcing.
""These firms moved their operations to a place like Mexico because it was cheaper to build things there,"" said Mr. Marino. ""The tax is supposed to make these firms indifferent between using their Mexico facilities and making things in the U.S.""
A tax would be especially painful for emerging-market nations such as China, the U.S.'s biggest trading partner. In addition to diminished demand for its exports, the dollar's strength would add to downward pressure on the Chinese currency, the yuan.
Credit Suisse estimates that a border adjustment would reduce merchandise exports from Asia by 3% to 4%, denting the region's growth by around 0.5 percentage point.
""Less global trade, whether through a border tax adjustment or something else, is bad for Asia,"" said Eric Stein, co-
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 233 of 1177

director of global income at Eaton Vance.
A border adjustment would likely benefit Mr. Stein's bets against the Singapore dollar and Chinese yuan, as well as his positions in a type of Treasury bond that protects against U.S. inflation.
""Lots of the policies of the Trump administration are inflationary, and this is one of them,"" said Mr. Stein.
U.S. corporations that depend on imported products say the plan will force them to raise prices and lay off workers. A group of over 100 companies including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp., Nike Inc. and Gap Inc., launched a group called Americans for Affordable Products to lobby against the tax. The plan could also face challenges under World Trade Organization rules, analysts say.
In a statement, Nike said it plans to work with the Trump administration and with Congress ""to explore alternatives to meet the goal of growing the U.S. economy and employment without the complexity and negative impacts of a border adjustment tax.""
U.S. exporters, including Dow Chemical Co. and Lockheed Martin Co., have praised the plan, which would likely bolster their overseas sales. ""The border adjustment tax...will be, for us, a big positive,"" said Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveris on an earnings call.

HSBC,The Suddenly Rising Cost of Making a Car; A jump in automotive commodity prices adds to car makers' worries in 2017," Feb 13, 2017",1,"The voguish theme of ""reflation"" has driven a rally in car stocks over the past three months. But reflation has a dark side, too: rising raw-material prices. The Trump jump in share prices could be an exit opportunity for investors before the squeeze on profits becomes more apparent.
The extra costs necessary to research , design and equip cars with new gizmos, including electric powertrains, self-driving features and connections to the digital cloud have understandably garnered attention in recent months. A step-up in investments in autonomous technology was the key reason why General Motors missed analysts' forecasts for fourth-quarter profit last week.
But a more traditional form of inflation will also weigh on car makers' margins this year: higher input costs. An index of automotive commodity prices like steel and rubber compiled by UBS is currently 38% above its level a year ago. European car makers, for instance, will face between [euro]200 million ($212.63 million) and [euro]700 million in extra costs each, depending on their unit sales, notes Horst Schneider of HSBC.
GM and Mercedes-maker Daimler have both played down the scale of this problem in recent calls with analysts. GM said raw-material costs as they currently stand could trim its profit, all else being equal, by a figure in the ""low hundreds of millions of dollars"" this year, while Daimler's comments hinted at an impact of roughly [euro]200 million--just 1.4% of 2016 adjusted operating profit. Both companies gave outlook statements implying ongoing earnings growth, albeit at a modest rate.
The problem is that such projections look more dependent than in previous years on ongoing growth in vehicle sales. Input costs also rose rapidly in 2010 and 2011, following the financial crisis, but this coincided with a recovery in consumer demand in key markets such as the U.S., China and the U.K. Cutting costs and using up spare capacity in factories more than offset the burden of rising costs on margins. But now both U.S. sales and most car makers' operating margins are at record highs.
If demand remains buoyant in key car markets--and stock prices imply a surge in optimism about prospects in the U.S.--then manufacturers should eke out further profit growth. If it doesn't, however, profits would crater in a perfect storm of falling sales and ballooning product-development and unit-input costs. Heads investors win a bit; tails and they stand to lose a lot. On balance, this looks a good time to be selling car stocks.

HSBC,"Foreign Investors Fret Over 'Frexit' Risk After French Election; Government bonds weaken ahead of the presidential election this spring, while equity and corporate bonds have mainly held up"," Feb 14, 2017",1,"French government bonds have steadily weakened ahead of the country's presidential election this spring, but French shares and corporate bonds have mainly held up. Panicked foreign investors may help explain why. Foreign-based investors own almost two thirds of the government-bond market but less than a third of French listed equity and nonfinancial corporate bonds.
That has raised questions over whether foreign investors are cooling on France and could back up recent evidence that investors are more sanguine about political risk in a country if they are in that country.
The chief risk in France is Marine Le Pen, the populist leader who wants to pull France out of the euro . She is gaining ground in polls, though she's still a distant second in a France's two-stage election. International investors fret about the possibility that Ms. Le Pen, the candidate for the far-right National Front party, will pull off a Brexit- style surprise and shock markets.
French debt maturing in 10 years now yields 0.7 percentage points more than the German equivalent. That spread has risen from as little as 0.21 percentage points last September and reached a four-year high last week.
French equity investors are confident that Ms. Le Pen will lose to a mainstream candidate, according to Socie?te? Ge?ne?rale. ""Foreign investors are less certain,"" the bank added in a recent research note.
While French sovereign yields have ratcheted higher against Germany's, French equities are trading in line with the rest of Europe.
The French CAC 40 has risen by 8.9% in the last six months, against an 8.2% rise for the broader Euro Stoxx index. Over 60% of French sovereign bonds are held abroad, but 28% of locally listed equity and investment fund shares are held overseas. according to the European Central Bank.
Data on Japanese holdings of foreign bonds may reflect that some foreign investors are saying au revoir. Japanese investors have been big buyers of French government debt in recent years. But in the final quarter of 2016 they bought ¥19 billion ($166.7 million), their lowest amount in a year and a half, and they began selling in the final two months of the year.
Foreign investors also hold less French corporate than government debt, owning 26% of bonds issued by nonfinancial companies.
Investors have been selling in that market. The spread between yields on the Bloomberg Barclays France Corporate bond index and the equivalent German index reached 0.35 percentage points last week, high by recent standards. But it has been much higher, a full percentage point in late 2012.
Likewise, daily trading volume in corporate bonds is 59% higher in February in comparison to the average over the last three years, according Trax, a subsidiary of trading platform MarketAxess. But the rise is sharper still in sovereign bonds, where volumes are up 82%.
There has been a recent pattern of locals being more relaxed about domestic political risks. In the immediate aftermath of the U.K's vote to leave the European Union . U.S.-domiciled funds investing in European equities recorded outflows of 9%, compared with 1.7% for funds domiciled in the region.
Analysts at HSBC believe that French corporate markets will catch up to sovereign bonds closer to the second voting round in May, but local biases will remain.
""We think investors are likely to react very differently to wider French spreads in April, based on their country of location, country of parent company and their own views of political outcomes,"" the bank said in a recent research note.

HSBC,China's Property Market Has a New Blind Spot; Home-price data from China's largest online real-estate portal no longer publicly available," Feb 14, 2017",1,"BEIJING--A private-sector data provider has quietly stopped publishing a widely watched barometer of China's property market that was one of the few alternatives to an official gauge, leaving a hole in a government- dominated flow of information on the Chinese economy.
Beijing-based Fang Holdings, China's largest online real-estate portal, has since at least 2010 published its compilation of home prices in 100 Chinese cities into a monthly index. The index usually shows sharper increases in China's runaway property prices than the official index, despite several interventions by Beijing to control property prices in recent years.
Fang has decided to stop updating the index online, to avoid disrupting the property market, Vincent Mo, Fang's chairman and chief executive, told The Wall Street Journal.
Home prices' frothy rise last year--especially in major cities such as Shenzhen, which saw spikes of up to 60%-- raised concerns that a leverage-fueled property boom could destabilize the financial system. That prompted a wave of home-purchase restrictions and tighter mortgage lending policies to rein in the market, which since the end of last year has started to stabilize.
Fang's home-price index showed prices rising at a faster pace than the official measure and was widely referred to in reports by analysts at international banks, including J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank.
Larry Hu, China economist at Macquarie Group, said he prefers to use the Fang index because it was published earlier in the month than official statistics and provides actual prices while the government gauge gives only the change in growth.
""I found the 100-city index much easier to use,"" Mr. Hu said.
In November, the latest month for which Fang's data was available, the average price for homes across 100 cities was 12,938 yuan ($1,879) a square meter, up 18.7% from a year earlier.
By comparison, government data showed that average home prices for the first 11 months of the year rose 10.8% compared with a year earlier. The National Bureau of Statistics said in its statement for November that home prices in first- and second-tier cities were stabilizing.
Mr. Mo said the government hadn't asked the company to stop publishing the home-price data online and that the decision was in line with ""zilu?,"" or the practice of self-discipline, which he said had prompted reflection about what actions best support the economy and Chinese society.
""As an influential research arm, I think it's good for us to see...a more stable development of the market,"" Mr. Mo said.
Investors and economists have long expressed skepticism about China's official statistics. As China's growth slowdown has deepened, Beijing has tried to exercise tighter control of the economic narrative, encouraging a less- gloomy outlook and what Communist Party officials have called ""positive energy.""
Last year, the Chinese government issued verbal warnings to economists, analysts and business reporters to brighten their outlooks on China's economy , according to officials and commentators with knowledge of the matter.
Fang isn't the first private indicator to change how it publishes. In June 2015, HSBC Holdings PLC ended its five- year sponsorship of China's purchasing-managers' index. A few months later, the new sponsor, Caixin Media Co., stopped publishing a gauge of the manufacturing industry, usually referred to as the ""flash PMI,"" that had provided
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 240 of 1177
an early read two weeks ahead of the official purchasing-managers index that analysts and economists had come to rely on.
A recent check of Fang's database software, China Real Estate Index System, showed the index hasn't been updated since November. Fang has continued to provide home-price data separately to clients, government agencies and business partners, Mr. Mo said.
Fang has been particularly useful for investors and watchers of China's housing market because it gathers a comprehensive vault of information, drilling down into sales turnover and square meters sold for specific city districts. Fang, which is publicly traded in New York, reported revenue of $250.1 million in the third quarter of last year, down nearly 13% from the previous quarter.
Mr. Mo said the housing market was volatile last year, leading to a sensitive period when Chinese media reports greatly influenced consumers and that some media outlets had focused on specific parts of Fang's housing data without providing context.
Mr. Mo said Fang expects to restart publishing the index online but didn't know when.
""Because of all the adjustments in the market, especially last year, we think it's probably better for everybody to be more careful,"" he said.

HSBC,"Mexico's Pemex Sets Euro Corporate Debt Record with $4.49 Billion Issue; The debt, issued across three tranches, has lower yields than expected"," Feb 14, 2017",1,"Mexico's national oil company Petro?leos Mexicanos issued [euro]4.25 billion ($4.49 billion) in bonds Tuesday, the largest euro-denominated emerging market corporate bond deal on record.
Emerging market investments have recovered from an initial slump after President Donald Trump's November election victory. Mexican assets in particular sold off after Mr. Trump's win , with the peso falling by as much as 16% against the dollar in the months after the result.
But the peso has rebounded somewhat, rising by 5.6% against the dollar in the last month. Other emerging market investments have also recovered from some of the Trump slump.
The deal is also a landmark for emerging market issuers in euro debt markets.
""The maturing European market is now able to offer deep funding, it's a bit of a coming of age,"" said Jean-Marc Mercier, global co-head of debt capital markets at HSBC, one of the banks acting as a bookrunner for Pemex.
The Pemex debt was issued across three tranches, maturing in 2021, 2024 and 2028. Yields on the bonds came in

lower than expected, at 2.512%, 3.839% and 4.979% respectively, despite the company's financial struggles in recent years.
Tumbling oil prices and pension obligations led to an injection of capital by the Mexican government last year, and Pemex is already highly leveraged.
The company presented its five-year business plan in November, outlining its cost-cutting efforts and plans to reduce oil production below 2 million barrels a day for the first time since 1980.
But rising oil prices have been a boon to energy companies around the world. Yields on the last euro-denominated bond sold by Pemex, a three-year note issued in March last year, have tumbled. The debt initially offered a 3.75% yield, which declined markedly as 2016 went on. The bond yielded 1.34% on Monday.
""When they issue in euros, they're going to get a lower yield than they would in dollar paper,"" said Sailesh Lad, emerging debt portfolio manager at AXA Investment Managers. ""The euro market has always been very small for EM, but over the last 24 months or so we've seen an increase in euro paper.""
Mr. Lad said he hadn't participated in the Pemex deal, as the fund already owns dollar-denominated Pemex debt. ""We're quite comfortable with what we already hold,"" he added.
The euro-denominated market in emerging market debt is still small in comparison to the dollar market, but has grown considerably in recent years.
According to data provider Dealogic, 121 euro bonds were taken to market by emerging market issuers in 2016, more than at any point since the single currency began in 1999.
To be sure, not all investors were enamored with the investment opportunity offered by Pemex.
""We have a cautious view on the fundamentals, so we didn't participate,"" said Charles de Quinsonas, deputy fund manager of the M&G emerging markets bond fund. ""I don't think it's a bad company, but I don't think we're being compensated for the risk and reward at that price.""

HSBC,"Asian Corporate-Bond Investors Shrug Off Trump Doubts; Despite warnings that the U.S. president's economic agenda could be bad for global trade, corporate debt is proving popular"," Feb 16, 2017",1,"HONG KONG--Investors in corporate bonds world-wide seemed to have missed the memo on President Donald Trump.
Despite warnings that Mr. Trump's economic agenda could be bad for global trade and growth--and hence company earnings--corporate debt has proved a popular investment class so far this year.
Nowhere is the trend more surprising than in Asia, where money has kept flowing into even the riskiest debt. The extra yield, or spread, investors demand for holding both investment-grade and high-yield Asian corporate debt versus risk-free U.S. Treasurys has narrowed since the U.S. election last November, and is heading toward its tightest levels since 2008, according to indexes published by Citigroup. Bond yields fall as their prices rise.
The strong demand has come despite analysts' warnings that Asian companies, particularly big exporters, could suffer under any new protectionist measures from the U.S. under Mr. Trump; and that the greenback's recent strength could hit Asian companies that have issued dollar-denominated debt while making most of their earnings in local currencies.
Much of the demand for Asian corporate debt is coming from local investors, who have a massive--and growing-- pool of cash they are keen to deploy, despite diminishing returns they earn for the risk they take on.
""We were cautiously optimistic on credit entering the year, but it has taken me by surprise, the strength of this rally,"" said Harsh Agarwal, head of Asia credit research at Deutsche Bank in Singapore. ""This wasn't anyone's base case when the year started.""
The trend echoes the U.S., where corporate-bond spreads are at their tightest in two years. There, investors have been scooping up debt as the outlook for U.S. companies brightens given the Trump administration's goals to slash taxes and regulation, and spend heavily on infrastructure.
In Europe, investors have also continued to pile into corporate credit in countries like Germany and France, despite the uncertainty created by key elections on the continent this year that has driven spreads wider in Italy and Spain. Appetite has remained high largely thanks to the European Central Bank's purchases of tens of billions of euros worth of corporate bonds.
For sure, macroeconomic concerns persist in Asia, particularly with the U.S. government's trade agenda yet to be defined in detail. Still, the International Monetary Fund reckons the region will see healthy economic growth of 6.4% this year.
To date, the vast majority of Asian companies have remained able to service their debts. The default rate on high- yield corporate bonds was lower in Asia than in the U.S. last year--at 1% versus 3.6%. The measure could rise but is forecast to remain low at 2% in Asia this year, compared with 2.5% in the U.S., according to HSBC Global Asset Management.
Moreover, with interest rates globally still low by historical standards, cash-rich investors are on the lookout for higher-yielding assets. Total household wealth is growing faster in Asia than elsewhere globally, up 4.5% in 2016 to $80 trillion, according to Credit Suisse.
""Clients are saying we have money to put to work--and we need to buy,"" said Deutsche Bank's Mr. Agarwal.
Bond issuers from risky sectors are taking advantage. Earlier this week, Road King Infrastructure Ltd., a Chinese property developer, raised $300 million from its issuance of U.S. dollar bonds at a coupon of 7.95%. The deal met such strong demand--more than $5.5 billion in orders--that it priced nearly 0.7 percentage point lower than the 8.625%-area in which it was marketed.
Asian investors ""tend to invest in what they know"" so their large pool of money--the so-called local bid--typically
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 247 of 1177
stays within the region, said Charles Chang, head of Asia credit strategy at BNP Paribas in Hong Kong.
Because this growing pool of money is chasing a shrinking pool of assets, spreads could continue to grind tighter. U.S. dollar debt issuance in Asia ex-Japan rose to $361.1 billion in 2016, up 8% from a year earlier, according to data from Dealogic. Yet many companies are also redeeming bonds, so net new issuance is falling: It could be around $40 billion-$60 billion in 2017, half the average amount since 2012 said Alfred Mui, head of Asian credit at HSBC Global Asset Management.
The problem with tightening spreads is that there aren't any particularly good outcomes.
Some market stress could emerge leading to a bond market selloff, but even if the Asian economy improves the upside for bond prices could be limited given how tight spreads have become already.
That view has led some investors in the region to look for better deals elsewhere.
""In [Latin America] and emerging Europe, they don't have that local bid that we have in Asia, so their spreads aren't that tight,"" said Jack Siu, Asia-Pacific investment strategist at Credit Suisse in Hong Kong. ""We do see more value in those regions.""

HSBC,"For Winning Bets in Europe, Look to China; Shares of European companies with the tightest links to China have significantly outperformed their peers"," Feb 17, 2017",0,"Europe's economy is gaining strength, but its rallying stock markets may say as much about momentum in China. Shares of European companies with the tightest links to the Chinese economy have significantly outperformed their peers, helping the MSCI Europe index, a basket of stocks based in 15 European countries, rise more than 20% from its bottom in February 2016.
European stocks most closely correlated to the Chinese economy--such as mining companies and producers of
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 249 of 1177
capital goods like machinery and equipment--have fared 30% better than the overall market over the past year, according to an analysis by Deutsche Bank. Sectors with the most negative correlation to China--including telecoms, retail and pharmaceuticals--have performed the worst.
For decades European markets have followed Wall Street's lead, but China is becoming an increasingly big influence on the direction of local markets.
""It's been the year of the China trade,"" said Wolf von Rotberg, a strategist at Deutsche Bank.
To be sure, local shares have also benefited from improvements in both the European and U.S. economies.
The eurozone economy kept pace with that of the U.S. for the first time since 2008 last year while its jobless rate fell to a seven-year low.
The economy is expected to grow 1.6% this year, according to the European Commission, and a majority of fund managers surveyed by Bank of America expect European economic growth and inflation to pick up over the next year.
That has helped renew appetite for the region's equities despite concerns over the potential destabilizing effects of upcoming elections in France and the Netherlands.
But large parts of local stock markets are climbing higher on China's back.
European publicly traded companies collectively generate only 5%-6% of their revenue directly from mainland China, according to data provider FactSet. But China exerts a much bigger influence, through its massive impact on the global economic cycle, commodity prices, and broader appetite for risky assets.
That link was made clear in early 2016, when a meltdown in Chinese stocks and concerns about a falling yuan hit European shares hard. The Stoxx Europe 600 fell roughly 17% in the first six weeks of the trading year amid worries that the world's second-largest economy was on the brink of a downturn--more than twice the declines it posted in the immediate aftermath of Britain's vote to leave the European Union.
But China's economy appeared to stabilize after officials pumped it with cheap credit and state spending, pushing growth to 6.7% in 2016. China's producer-price index hit a five-year high in January 2017 after several slack years, while China's manufacturing sector has posted growth for six straight months . This has supported demand for European machinery and lifted economically sensitive parts of the region's stock market with it, analysts say. Sectors such as German industrials have done particularly well over the past year as a result of China's stimulus program, said Paul Markham, a director at Newton Investment Management.
""Europe is more of an economic follower,"" he said, requiring growth from areas such as China and the U.S. to drive its economy and stock markets higher.
Europe's mining sector, the region's best performer over the past year, has also been lifted by sharp gains in metals prices spurred by expectations for Chinese demand. Copper futures are up about 30% from a year ago and iron-ore futures have climbed to multiyear highs.
China accounts for more than half of global demand for most metals, according to S&P Global Ratings.
The U.K.'s FTSE 350 Mining index jumped 145% from its bottom a year ago, compared with a 32% rise in the broader FTSE 100.
Companies with big direct revenue exposure to mainland China have also outperformed . Luxury-goods maker LVMH Moe?t Hennessy Louis Vuitton, for instance, recently pointed to China as one reason its net profit jumped 14% in the second half of 2016. Its shares are up 31% from a year ago.
But because Europe is following China's lead on the way up, it is also exposed to downside should the country's growth waver.
While few expect a hard landing soon, recent data, including industrial profits and steel production, have suggested China's manufacturing sector may be cooling quicker than expected following last year's record stimulus. Analysts also point to a slowdown of new credit issuance relative to gross domestic product.
That isn't to say Europe isn't highly reliant on domestic and U.S. drivers as well.
Europe's beleaguered banking sector has also been a big driver of the recovery in European bourses, with lenders in the region up around 34% from a year ago, though the gains may have more to do with expectations for higher
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 250 of 1177

U.S. interest rates and a stabilization of Italian banks than with China.
But even among European banks, China exerts influence. Shares of Standard Chartered, which derives roughly 43% of revenue from the Asia-Pacific region, nearly doubled in the last year while HSBC shares rose 68%. That compares with a 32% increase for Deutsche Bank shares and 21% for UBS, two banks with significantly smaller Asian revenue exposure.
""It's been a quiet one...but the Chinese effect has had more of an impact [on European stocks] than Trump,"" said Caroline Vincent, investment director at Cavendish Asset Management, referring to the boost Donald Trump's presidential election gave to many markets.

HSBC,HSBC Holdings Earnings Preview--What to Watch; Analysts expect HSBC to report a fourth-quarter net profit of $1.4 billion," Feb 20, 2017",1,"
HSBC Holdings PLC reports its fourth-quarter financial results Tuesday morning at 0400 GMT. Here's what you need to know:
EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts expect HSBC to report a fourth-quarter net profit of $1.4 billion, according to
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 255 of 1177
consensus estimates compiled by the bank. That compares with a net loss of $1.33 billion in the same period last year from a spike in bad oil and gas loans.
WHAT TO WATCH:
RATES: Expectations of further U.S. rate rises are being baked into HSBC's share price, with the stock up 8% this year. Analysts are looking for more guidance on the bank's sensitivity to rates, particularly on net interest margins and return on equity in its Hong Kong business.
DIVIDEND: Going hand in hand with improved returns is the bank's ability to raise dividends, or do another stock buyback. Bernstein analysts recently presented a bullish case where HSBC's dividend reaches around $0.67 in 2018, from an expected $0.51 for 2016, and another $1.01 a share being available to return to shareholders. To get there, it sees nine U.S. rate increases over three years, a benign Brexit, strong trade finance and good market conditions for selling legacy assets.
GLOBAL TRADE: Trade finance is integral to HSBC, so analysts are looking for any comments from executives on how President Trump could reshape global trade and what the effect might be on key HSBC markets of China and Mexico.

HSBC,Stock Indexes Climb to Records; All 11 sectors of the S&amp;amp;P 500 post gains," Feb 21, 2017",1,"Corrections &Amplifications
The S&P 500 gained 0.6%. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the stock index as the S&P 600.
A broad rally in U.S. stocks lifted major indexes to fresh records again.
All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 rose on Tuesday, led by gains in real-estate, utilities and consumer-staples shares, and the overall index closed at its 10th record of the year.
Investors have been betting that potential tax cuts and fiscal stimulus under the Trump administration will boost corporate profits and keep stocks moving higher .
""Companies didn't all of a sudden become much more profitable,"" said Ron Weiner, managing director of RDM Financial Group at wealth management firm HighTower Advisors. ""The markets are filled with optimism for a number of proposals.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 118.95 points, or 0.6%, to 20743.00, notching its eighth consecutive record. The S&P 500 gained 14.22 points, or 0.6%, to 2365.38, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 27.37 points, or 0.5%, to 5865.95, its 19th record of the year.
Gains in Wal-Mart Stores helped push the S&P 500 consumer-staples sector up 1%. The world's largest retailer

added $2.08, or 3%, to $71.45 after reporting strong sales for the winter holiday season. It was the stock's largest one-day percentage gain since May.
Energy companies climbed 0.7%, as U.S. crude oil for March delivery gained 1.2% to $54.06 a barrel.
U.S. government bonds weakened, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note edging higher to 2.429% from 2.425% Friday. Bond yields rise as prices fall.
In currency markets, the dollar climbed after Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Patrick Harker said in comments released this week that he might support a rate increase in March if there was further evidence of inflation.
The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of 16 currencies, rose 0.3%.
Federal-funds futures, used by investors to bet on central-bank policy, showed a 22% chance of a rate rise in March, compared with an 18% chance on Friday, according to CME Group data.
The Stoxx Europe 600 gained 0.6%. European bank shares fell, however, keeping wider gains in check, with HSBC Holdings down 6.5% after the Asia-focused lender reported unexpectedly weak fourth-quarter results.
Earlier Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average added 0.7%, as a stronger dollar and the prospects of higher U.S. rates lifted shares of financial and auto companies. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.8%.

HSBC,HSBC to Buy Back More Shares After Net Loss Widens; Bank gives mixed outlook for 2017; shares fall 6.5% in London," Feb 21, 2017",1,"HSBC Holdings PLC reported unexpectedly weak fourth-quarter results and said shifting attitudes toward globalization could affect its business.
Executives at the bank said Tuesday that a changed U.S. stance on global trade, the rise of populism in Europe and Britain's planned exit from the European Union have added uncertainty in HSBC's key markets. They gave a mixed outlook for 2017, saying rising interest rates will help it in the medium term but that revenue in the U.K. and emerging markets is being dented by a strong dollar.
HSBC's fourth-quarter earnings fell short of analyst expectations because of a series of charges, but also reflected margin pressures in some businesses.
Its net loss widened to $4.23 billion in the three months to the end of December from $1.33 billion in 2015's fourth
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 259 of 1177
quarter. Full-year net profit sank to $2.48 billion from $13.52 billion.
HSBC's shares fell 6.5%, to £6.66 ($8.30) in London. The stock has gained about 50% in a year, mainly on hopes that future U.S. interest-rate rises would lift margins and revenue.
Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver said political change could shift global trade into regional blocs, while predicting London will remain the dominant financial center in the region even after some business relocates to the EU because of Brexit. HSBC repeated its plans to move about 1,000 jobs to Paris in the next two years.
There was some good news for investors. HSBC said it would buy back as much as $1 billion in shares, adding to $2.5 billion bought back last year, and left the door open for further buybacks as capital is freed up at its U.S. business this year. The bank is among the most strongly capitalized in Europe.
HSBC has undergone a major restructuring since 2011 under the leadership of Mr. Gulliver and Chairman Douglas Flint, exiting from most of Latin America and placing more focus on Asia . Mr. Flint is set to step down after a successor is announced this year, and then the new chairman will seek a successor to Mr. Gulliver. Mr. Gulliver said Tuesday that Mr. Flint might not depart until 2018.
HSBC's struggles to get on top of its financial crime-fighting systems continued. It spent $1.6 billion on implementing global standards--anti-money-laundering systems and controls used across the bank--but the monitor overseeing its compliance with a 2012 U.S. legal settlement found continuing deficiencies.
HSBC agreed to pay $1.9 billion in 2012 to settle allegations by the U.S. Justice Department that it failed to catch money laundering and violated sanctions. The bank admitted to the failings and entered a five-year deferred prosecution agreement.
Mr. Gulliver said the monitor identified some potential failings in its U.K. anti-money-laundering controls at the end of 2016, causing the U.K. financial regulator to order a fresh review.

HSBC,HSBC Feels Chill Wind From Trump on Trade; Protectionism and populism could be a threat to the bank," Feb 21, 2017",0,"HSBC is in a strong position, but there is a danger that investors have become over-optimistic about its potential revenue recovery especially if President Donald Trump really wants to break global trade.
Signs of that danger showed in its full-year results out Tuesday. For a bank that says it generates nearly half its

revenue from business that crosses international borders, rising protectionism and populism were highlighted as threats. Revenues were already weaker than expected at the end of 2016.
The U.K.-based bank fell to a loss in the fourth quarter and saw full-year profits drop by 62%. It had many one-time hits including $3 billion spent on cost-cutting programs, a $3.2 billion goodwill write-off against its shrunken private bank and a $1.7 billion loss on the sale of its Brazilian business.
However, the Brazilian sale did release capital to fund a further $1 billion share buyback for the first half of 2017, following the $2.5 billion done last year. This is less than half the $2.5 billion analysts expect in 2017.
But there should be more capital released: HSBC has approval to extract the first slug of more than $8 billion in excess capital stuck in its U.S. holding company . That first slug could be $1 billion to $2 billion, but the bank won't say until after it gets the money out sometime during the second quarter.
The bank's preference is to reinvest excess capital in growth, mostly in Asia, but growth isn't yet materializing. It looks likely to become increasingly dependent on trade among Asian economies, particularly if President Trump enters a trade war with China, or breaks the North American trade group where HSBC links the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
The harder it is to find growth, the more likely HSBC will have capital to return . But compared with U.S. peers such as J.P. Morgan, which has both capital to return and improving growth prospects, that isn't cause for too much excitement.

HSBC,"Saudi Aramco Picks J.P. Morgan, HSBC, Morgan Stanley as Lead IPO Underwriters; Much of the money raised would go to country's sovereign-wealth fund to diversify economy through investments"," Feb 21, 2017",0,"Saudi Arabia's state-owned energy company has told J.P. Morgan, HSBC and Morgan Stanley they will be the lead underwriters for its planned initial public offering, set to be the largest ever, according to people familiar with the matter.
The three banks will lead the giant offering of about as much as 5% of Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Saudi Aramco, the people said.
The three banks declined to comment. A spokesperson for Aramco said the firm doesn't comment on rumor or speculation.
Analysts say the stake being offered could fetch as much at $100 billion to $150 billion and Saudi Arabian Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has estimated that the entire company is valued over $2 trillion .
Much of the money raised by the IPO would go to the country's sovereign-wealth fund , which would use it to diversify the kingdom's economy through investments. The Financial Times recently reported the three were favorites to win lead roles on the deal.
The IPO's massive size and its importance as part of Saudi Arabia's National Transformation Plan to modernize the kingdom's economy and wean it off oil has pushed banks to try to win a coveted underwriter role. That competition is expected to force underwriters to accept sharply lower fees, though they still stand to gain from a bonanza of fees because of the offering's magnitude.
Participation in a successful IPO also has longer-term implications for the banks by positioning them to win additional, future business as the Middle Eastern country continues to seek advice on reshaping its economy. Prince Mohammed has said the listing would occur in 2018. But complications restructuring Aramco and disentangling its finances from the government could delay the IPO until 2019 , The Wall Street Journal reported last week.
Aramco says it managed over 260 billion barrels of oil reserves for the Saudi kingdom and pumps almost 10 million barrels a day--far more than private-sector competitors such as Exxon Mobil Corp.
With the three main underwriters lined up, the next challenge will be to fill out the rest of the underwriting syndicate. Aramco and its advisers also need to select an exchange to list its shares following the new issue. Aramco is leaning toward listing its giant, state-run oil company on the New York, London or Toronto exchanges and has soured on the prospect of floating shares of the firm on an Asian stock exchange, people familiar with the matter said, The Wall Street Journal reported this week.

XPO Logistics Inc. Chief Executive Bradley Jacobs says the company is ""benefiting from the tailwinds of e- commerce."" The operator reported strong gains in profits and revenue for the fourth quarter, WSJ Logistics Report's Jennifer Smith writes, riding a surge in online shopping that drove demand for logistics businesses. The report, which included $27.3 million in net profits in the fourth quarter and $63.1 million in full-year earnings, marks a kind of watershed for the business: the profits came as overall gross revenue for the business doubled last year over 2015, capping an acquisition shopping spree that has built the company into a $14.6 billion operation. Many of the business units were disparate operations, but Mr. Jacobs says they've been combined to save costs and drive efficient delivery of services. E-commerce trends appear to be backing the combinations, with ""last-mile"" delivery fitting in with warehouse operations and increasingly profitable trucking services in the U.S. and Europe. DB Schenker is back in the market for more U.S. business, and that could lead to more consolidation in American logistics operations. Chief Executive Jochen Thewes tells WSJ Logistics Reports Brian Baskin the German operator, one of the world's largest logistics providers, remains a fairly small presence in a $700 billion-a-year U.S. freight market and expects to settle on an acquisition plan later this year . DB Schenker absorbed one big U.S. logistics operation with its acquisition of BAX Global in 2006, and it may look now toward operators with big domestic strength rather than international players. Switzerland-based competitor Kuehne + Nagel International AG made that sort of move in 2015 with its buy of freight broker ReTrans. But with more than $17 billion in annual gross revenue and the backing of parent Deutsche Bahn AG, the company likely has the backing to make any move its strategy demands.
The U.S. supply chain for organic grains increasingly begins overseas, and that's drawing complaints from American farmers. Supplies of organic corn and soybeans from countries including Turkey, Ukraine and Argentina are surging, the WSJ's Jacob Bunge reports, reflecting the growing appetite of U.S. consumers for organic products and the challenge U.S. companies face in meeting demand . U.S. organic-farming groups say the influx of foreign grain helped slash prices for organic corn by about 30% in 2016, but that the import business presents unfair competition. Some U.S. farmers contend overseas organic farms benefit from looser oversight, giving them an edge over domestic farms. They're seeking better tracking of grains throughout a supply chain where agricultural goods often go through commodities traders, and certification back to the source of the imports. E-COMMERCE
While Washington remains locked in a struggle over how to pay for roads, more states are arriving at a single solution: raise the gas tax. Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Haslam recently joined a parade of governors pressing for or signing fuel tax increases , the WSJ's Cameron McWhirter reports. Nearly 20 states, with both Republican and Democratic governors, have raised gas taxes or recalculated gas-tax formulas in recent years to generate funds for upgrades to aging roads and bridges. This legislative season, at least a dozen more are considering such measures, defying Republican Party barriers against tax increases amid frustration at decaying roads and depleted highway funds. Lawmakers in Washington are preparing to consider a plan to spend as much as $1 trillion on infrastructure, and some believe the state actions may make it politically easier for Congress to raise the federal fuels tax for the first time in 24 years.

Both big- box retailers report sales at their brick-and-mortar stores improved over the holiday season , the WSJ's Sarah Nassauer and Anne Steele report, even as investments in e-commerce helped expand online purchases. With its heavy spending, including the acquisition of Jet.com, Wal-Mart has been under heavy scrutiny, and reported a 16% gain in online sales last quarter--a slowdown from 21% growth the previous quarter.

HSBC,"Saudi Aramco, Petronas to Sign Joint-Venture Agreement; Refining and petrochemicals project will be in the southern state of Johor"," Feb 22, 2017",1,"
Saudi Arabian Oil Co., or Saudi Aramco, and Malaysia's national oil company plan to sign an agreement Monday to jointly develop an up to 89 billion ringgit ($20 billion) refining and petrochemicals project in the southern state of Johor, according to three people familiar with the matter.
The memorandum of understanding between the Saudi oil giant and Petroliam Nasional Bhd., or Petronas, is expected to be signed during a visit by Saudi Arabia's King Salman to Malaysia, the people said.
Saudi Aramco had decided to drop its plans to partner Petronas, people aware of the matter had said in January, after the world's largest oil firm conducted a feasibility study and concluded that the project wouldn't generate sufficient returns.
It wasn't immediately clear if the two oil firms had agreed on new terms to develop the project.
Saudi Aramco and Petronas declined to comment.
The companies were in talks to create a joint venture partnership to build a refinery with capacity to process 300,000 barrels of oil a day, alongside a petrochemical complex with a combined annual chemical output of 7.7 million metric tons, according to the people.
Petronas has previously estimated the proposed complex, located at a fishing town in Johor, just opposite Singapore, would cost some 53 billion ringgit to build. Related facilities ranging from raw-water supply to a plant to turn liquefied natural gas back into gas would cost another 36 billion ringgit.
Saudi Aramco's decision to take part in the project will be a likely boost to Malaysia's only Fortune 500 company. Petronas is recovering from low oil prices over the past two years and was looking for new ways to boost revenue after embarking on a sweeping cost-reduction program.

Treasury's Mnuchin Raises Concerns Over Bank Lending, Liquidity U.K. Banks Unlikely to Keep Full EU Access, Bundesbank Official Says China's Open Markets--Much Talk, Little Action
After agreeing to uphold the ""One China"" policy in a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, U.S. President Donald Trump is moving closer to finally starting a discussion with Beijing over its trade and currency practices. As relations between the new administration and China take hold, however, there are several areas that Mr. Trump has yet to recognize publicly as sore points for the U.S. One of them: Wall Street firms' limited access to China's financial sector.
China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. After a five-year grace period, the country was supposed to open its doors wider to foreign banks. While that happened on paper, in reality rules have made it difficult for foreign banks to penetrate the market. The share of foreign banking operations amounted to just 1.4% of China's total banking assets in 2015, according the China Banking Regulatory Commission. It was 2.4% in 2007.
In practice, foreign banks must create separate companies to operate in China and face difficulties opening branches.
""As a result, foreign banks have almost no retail banking business, and they can't utilize their more efficient banking services to compete head to head against China's own banks,"" said Scott Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. ""There are similar constraints still in place for the securities business, credit ratings, insurance and credit cards.""
Discussions about a bilateral investment treaty started in 2008 and have dragged on without a deal. It isn't clear whether such talks will continue under Mr. Trump.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 275 of 1177
Meanwhile, repeated assurances by Chinese regulators to allow the world greater access to the country's finance industry are getting stale.
The National Development and Reform Commission made such a promise in December. Then, the State Council said it would ease investment curbs, including in banking, securities, futures, fund management and insurance. Its statement was published Jan. 17, the same day President Xi Jinping took to the stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Critics quickly pointed out the irony of an economic nationalist declaring China's openness to the world.
Beijing has kept its finance sector well protected because banks are its major conduit for implementing economic policy. By and large, funds flow to China's corporate sector through state-owned banks, not the securities market.
A foreign commercial bank can own up to 25% of a domestic commercial bank, while a foreign investment bank can own up to 49% of a securities joint venture. For example, HSBC Holdings PLC has a 19.9% stake in Bank of Communications Co., while UBS Group AG and Morgan Stanley have been looking to increase stakes in their securities joint ventures to 49%, from about 25% and about 33%, respectively.
Other areas of finance are up for review. A December draft of revised rules for opening up markets loosened restrictions on the credit-rating industry.
Currently, foreign firms can rate domestic securities only through joint ventures--something the likes of Moody's Investors Service, Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings have been reluctant to do.
Most China observers aren't hopeful about meaningful change to the finance sector, given that Mr. Trump has focused his complaints toward China on its trade and currency practices.
""I don't see China taking a pre-emptive action to further open up its banking market to foreign banks at this stage, given already heightened trade tensions, particularly with the U.S."" said Matthew Phillips, a Hong Kong-based financial-services partner at PwC. ""Trade is going to drive the dynamic between the two countries and until China sees the lay of the land, it might not want to show its hand and further open access to a critical area.""
Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond Trump Team Broadens Search for Fed Regulatory Post
By Ryan Tracy and Andrew Ackerman
WASHINGTON--The Trump administration has broadened its search for a key regulatory job at the Federal Reserve, according to people familiar with the matter, meeting in recent weeks with at least two people about the post of Fed vice chair in charge of bank oversight.
President Donald Trump hasn't announced who he will nominate to the currently vacant post, and his decision won't be final until that happens. He also has at least two other seats on the Fed's seven-member board to fill. One of those is currently vacant, and the other will be open once Fed governor Daniel Tarullo, currently the de facto chief of bank oversight, resigns in early April.
The administration is still said to be considering David Nason, a former Treasury Department official in the
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 276 of 1177

administration of President George W. Bush and currently an executive in the financing arm of General Electric Co. Mr. Nason had emerged as the front-runner for the job weeks ago, people familiar with the matter said at the time.
President Trump's team also recently met with Richard Davis, the chief executive of U.S. Bancorp, and Hal Scott, a professor at Harvard Law School, according to people familiar with the matter.
A spokesman for Mr. Davis, responding to an inquiry on Thursday, said ""Richard is not a candidate for the Fed position. He is focused on a successful CEO transition in April."" U.S. Bank said in January Mr. Davis will be stepping down from the CEO role in April, while remaining on as executive chairman.
Mr. Scott declined to comment. The White House had no immediate comment. A GE spokeswoman had no comment.
The meetings provide more evidence the administration is looking at candidates who will take a less aggressive regulatory posture than the Fed did under the Obama administration, in line with the desire of Mr. Trump and his advisers to pare back regulations spurred by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law.
Mr. Scott has publicly criticized some of the Fed's regulatory moves, for instance by suggesting capital requirements are too strict and calling on the central bank to disclose more about its annual ""stress tests"" of banks' resilience and ""living wills"" that outline how they would fail without taxpayer support. He is director of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, a group of financial industry representatives and academics that comments on regulatory policy, often in ways critical of the Fed.
Mr. Davis has been chief executive of Minneapolis-based U.S. Bank since 2006. His bank, one of the country's largest, has dealt with many of the new rules and stricter enforcement under the Obama administration, though he hasn't railed against them in public as strongly as some other bankers.
Mr. Nason, for his part, appears to be getting a push from people with access to the highest levels of the administration.
On Thursday, Mr. Trump was meeting with manufacturing CEOs at the White House. As the group was waiting for the president within earshot of reporters, Jeffrey Immelt, chief executive of GE, greeted Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and said, ""Secretary, just wanted to tell you Dave Nason is a great guy.""

WSJ Pro: Treasury's Mnuchin Raises Concerns Over Bank Lending, Liquidity By Ryan Tracy
WASHINGTON--Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin raised concerns about banks' ability to meet lending demands on Thursday, suggesting rules affecting bank holdings of cash and securities could be in the Trump administration's crosshairs.
""There's an extraordinary amount of liquidity trapped in the system at banks,"" Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview on Fox Business Network, echoing a comment he made on CNBC earlier in the day. ""We're all for banks being highly regulated but we want to make sure that banks are lending. That is the No. 1 priority for us.""
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 277 of 1177

Mr. Mnuchin didn't specify which rules he was blaming for the problem he perceived. Regulators have adopted several new rules targeting banks' balance sheets in recent years, an effort to prevent them from taking the outsize risks that had destabilized large firms during the financial crisis. As Treasury secretary, Mr. Mnuchin doesn't have final say over regulatory policy, but he is helping to pick the officials who will.
One set of rules, including the so-called liquidity coverage ratio, forces large banks to hold a minimum amount of cash or securities that could be quickly sold, so they would be able to pay their bills in the event of a sudden credit crunch. The restriction means banks can't dedicate that cash to loans or other investments, a downside regulators have so far been willing to accept in the name of a safer financial system.
The Volcker rule, which bans banks from trading for their own account, has also been blamed for affecting market liquidity, or the ability of investors to buy and sell securities quickly at a desired price. Critics say the rule is a big reason why banks have reduced their trading activity, while defenders of the rule point to other factors, such as the rise of electronic trading by non-bank firms.
Mr. Mnuchin has criticized the Volcker rule in the past and did so again in the Fox interview, saying it has ""hurt liquidity"" and that policy makers need to clarify the definition of banned trading.
Meanwhile, an official at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York signaled in a speech Thursday an openness to discussing whether post-crisis rules have struck the right balance between safety and economic growth.
""In my view, it is entirely appropriate to continuously evaluate and rigorously assess the impact to ensure that the observed outcomes are consistent with stated objectives, such as greater resilience, efficient financial intermediation over time, and financial stability,"" said Kevin Stiroh, the New York Fed's head of supervision.
He pointed specifically to liquidity and capital rules, which he said can increase banks' safety while reducing their ability to provide financial services. ""A firm holding a large buffer of low-return, highly liquid assets might be stronger from a liquidity perspective, but might have less lending capacity,"" he said.
Mr. Stiroh also defended post-crisis rules, saying the financial system is much more resilient than it used to be.
The New York Fed doesn't have final say over rules for banks, but it enforces regulations adopted in Washington and participates in the development of new rules.
WSJ Pro: Regulators Issue Guidance Aimed at Robo Investment Advisers By Dave Michaels
U.S. market regulators on Thursday issued their first set of guidelines aimed at robo advisers, a burgeoning class of money managers that have sometimes come under fire for whether they're sufficiently clear about how their platforms work.
Robo advisers such as Betterment LLC and Wealthfront Inc. use algorithms to analyze a client's demographic profile and investment goals in order to build a portfolio for them. Humans aren't involved in picking assets and, as a result, the firms can undercut other brokers and money managers by selling their services at a lower cost.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 278 of 1177

The Securities and Exchange Commission, in guidance issued Thursday, said lack of human interaction means robo advisers should take special care to disclose how they operate, including whether they can cut off clients' ability to trade during bouts of market turmoil. Betterment faced criticism last year for suspending all trading for institutional customers during the mayhem that followed the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union.
""As technology continues to improve and make profound changes to the financial services industry, it's important for regulators to assess its impact on U.S. markets and give thoughtful guidance to market participants,"" said SEC Acting Chairman Michael Piwowar.
Betterment, which manages $7.8 billion in assets, has said it halted trading to protect investors from paying higher transaction costs associated with buying and selling securities when volatility spikes. Some Betterment clients said they weren't informed about the halt. The firm has updated a required regulatory disclosure to provide greater detail around its trading discretion.
""We appreciate the SEC's thoughtful and rigorous analysis of the space,"" said Betterment spokesman Joe Ziemer. ""We think there is valuable guidance for the companies providing these types of services and for investors considering them.""
Investors who use robo advisers typically answer brief questionnaires that provide the firm with factors on which to base a diversified portfolio. But sometimes clients provide inconsistent answers, and not all firms try to resolve that, the SEC said. The SEC said robo advisers might want to use ""alerts"" to inform investors when their answers conflict.
Robo advisers may also need to implement policies that help detect and protect against cybersecurity threats, the SEC said..
WSJ Pro: Business Roundtable Urges White House to Roll Back Financial Rules By Gabriel T. Rubin
WASHINGTON--A trade group representing large U.S. companies urged the White House to repeal or modify a slew of regulations, including several that affect financial services firms.
The letter from the Business Roundtable, which was sent a day in advance of a meeting between President Donald Trump and manufacturing executives on Thursday, identifies four financial regulations the executives and their members would like to see rolled back. The letter was addressed to Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. president who now heads Mr. Trump's National Economic Council.
The Business Roundtable called on the Trump administration to overhaul the shareholder proposal process to pare down the ability of ""activist investors with insignificant stakes in public companies"" to ""pursue social or political agendas"" and to reconsider a Dodd-Frank Act requirement for firms to disclose CEO pay as a ratio of average employee pay.
Both of those rules are under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission, as is a rule to require public companies to disclose whether their products contain ""conflict minerals"" originating in certain central African countries. The Business Roundtable asks that that rule be reconsidered as well.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 279 of 1177

They also requested a ""transitional period"" in order to comply with new margin requirements for over-the-counter derivatives.
The Trump administration has made deregulation a key part of its governing agenda, releasing an executive order shortly after Mr. Trump took office that called on federal agencies to eliminate two regulations for every new one created.
The Business Roundtable's requests followed the unveiling of Trump administration principles earlier in February on how to overhaul the financial regulatory system. Mr. Trump has directed the Treasury Department, under Secretary Steven Mnuchin, to undertake a broad review of financial rules as part of the administration's efforts to spur economic growth.
U.K. Banks Unlikely to Keep Full EU Access, Bundesbank Official Says By Paul Hannon
U.K.-based bank operations are unlikely to retain access to the European Union's single market after Brexit and a transition period to allow for a measured relocation process would be desirable, a senior Bundesbank official said Friday.
The U.K. voted in June 2016 to leave the EU and the government is expected to trigger a two-year period of exit talks next month. In January, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said the U.K. intended to leave the EU's single market and would instead seek a new free-trade agreement to allow the country to continue selling goods and services easily to EU member states.
However, Andreas Dombret, a member of the German central bank's executive board who is responsible for financial regulation, said that would make it unlikely that U.K.-based banks would retain a ""passport"" that would allow them to sell services in the EU.
""It seems that the prospects for EU market access through the U.K. look rather dim,"" said Mr. Dombret, speaking at the opening of a London office by Zeb, a German consultancy focused on financial services.
The U.K. could seek a status known as equivalence, under which the EU would recognize that its regulatory regime was the same as its own and its regulated institutions would therefore gain access to the bloc. However, Mr. Dombret said this status was likely to be too uncertain for banks making long-term location decisions. He added that there was no precedent for financial services being ""fully integrated"" in a free-trade agreement between the EU and another country.
Mr. Dombret warned that a transition period to allow banks a longer period in which to move some operations out of London might prove politically difficult, even if it made economic sense.
He said it was even possible that the two years of negotiations could end without an agreement, leaving the U.K. to exit from the bloc without any special deal--an outcome that would be economically damaging to both the U.K. and the EU.
""While economic policy will of course be an important topic during negotiations, we should not count on economic sanity being the main guiding principle,"" he said.

Bankers worry that such an outcome would interrupt access to complex financial instruments for businesses and investors around Europe, since the provision of those products is concentrated in London.
Mr. Dombrets acknowledged that a sudden halt in the availability of products that allow businesses and investors to manage currency and other risks could threaten financial stability across the continent. But he said he was confident financial institutions would prepare for every possible outcome.
""We are working under the assumption that the financial sector will adapt to whatever outcome the negotiations will yield,"" he said. ""It is not a pressing financial stability risk.""
Mr. Dombret also warned against the U.K. easing regulation to retain banks, or other parts of Europe doing so to attract institutions that are on the move.
""We must avoid a regulatory race to the bottom at all costs,"" he said. U.S. Renews Real-Estate Data Targeting Order
The U.S. Treasury Department extended for another six months a data-collection program to aid a crackdown on money laundering in real estate.
The program, which began in March 2016 and was expanded in August, requires title insurance companies to identify the true owners of limited liability companies that buy luxury real estate in all-cash transactions in some large cities, including New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Miami. It was set to end Thursday; the renewal expires Aug. 22.
Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, which issued the directives, known as geographic targeting orders, said in a statement that the data collected thus far corroborate the agency's concerns about the use of shell companies to buy high-end property.
Acting FinCEN director Jamal El-Hindi said in the statement that the geographic-targeting orders are ""producing valuable data"" that's assisting law enforcement and are ""serving to inform our future efforts to address money laundering in the real-estate sector.""
Stephen Hudak, a FinCEN spokesman, declined to comment on any future plans to address the issue. Risk &Compliance Journal reported last year on the orders representing the first step toward broader anti-money laundering compliance requirements for the real-estate industry, which had previously fended off such efforts from the federal government after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
The goal, Treasury says, is to make it more difficult for buyers, particularly foreigners, to launder money through U.S. property purchases. About one-third of the transactions covered by the orders involve a person who is already the subject of a suspicious-activity report, FinCEN said.
Treasury says the orders impose the requirements on title-insurance companies because such insurance is a common feature in the vast majority of real-estate transactions, including those that don't involve banks, which would perform checks for money-laundering risks when considering whether to fund a mortgage. As such, Treasury says, the title insurance companies ""can provide FinCEN with valuable information"" about transactions of
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 281 of 1177

concern.
Michelle Korsmo, chief executive of the American Land Title Association, a trade group representing the companies covered by the orders, said the efforts of their member for the past year ""appear to be beneficial"" to the federal government's work identifying money-laundering schemes in real-estate purchases.
""We continue to work closely with our members and FinCEN to collect the needed information as efficiently as possible,"" said Ms. Korsmo.
FinCEN collects and analyzes suspicious-activity reports filed by financial institutions, and Mr. Hudak said banks have also been filing more reports related to potential money laundering involving real estate as a result of the attention generated by the geographic targeting orders.
Mr. Hudak said the orders flagged, among others, beneficial owners suspected of being involved in public corruption in Asia and South America, and a beneficial owner who engaged in $160 million of suspicious financial activity and sought to disguise ownership of related financial accounts. He declined to provide further detail.
At some point, said Andrew Ittleman, a partner at Fuerst Ittleman David &Joseph PL, FinCEN will have to start the process of writing regulations to permanently formalize the process.
""Kicking the can down the road isn't the way this is supposed to be addressed. It's not the way federal agencies are supposed to create rules,"" he said.
Capital One Discloses Probe Into Anti-Money Laundering Program By AnnaMaria Andriotis
Capital One Financial Corp. is under investigation for its anti-money-laundering program, according to the company's annual securities filing.
The bank disclosed Thursday that it is under investigation by the New York District Attorney's Office, the Justice Department and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department over ""certain former check casher clients"" of its commercial banking business and over its anti-money-laundering program.
The bank's November filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said it had received subpoenas and requests for testimony, but not that it was being investigated.
A Capital One spokeswoman said the bank used different words in the filing to describe the same situation.
As previously disclosed, Capital One has also been the subject of an open consent order with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency since July 2015 over regulatory deficiencies in its anti-money-laundering program.
The OCC action has posed a hurdle for Capital One's planned acquisition of the Cabela's Inc. credit-card portfolio, raising the possibility another bank will snatch that deal away. That deal was announced last year when Bass Pro Shops agreed to purchase Cabela's. Capital One agreed to buy the credit-card business as part of the deal.
On Capital One's earnings call last month, Chief Executive Richard Fairbank said the bank didn't expect to receive
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 282 of 1177

regulatory approval for the purchase before Oct. 3. That is when Cabela's and Bass Pros Shops can walk away from the transaction. He added that the bank wouldn't be able to refile its application for the deal until after ""we have completed our work under the AML consent order.""
WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup Brazil's Credit Market Likely to Recover in 2H
The amount of credit in Brazil's financial system, which started this year declining, is expected to recover some ground in 2H, says the economist team at Banco de Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Brasil. ""Banks will continue adopting a cautious approach on lending (mainly in the first half) due to the risk of higher delinquency rates by individuals and by companies. But, there is scope for some acceleration of credit supply from the second half of this year on, following higher economic growth rate,"" it says. Credit totaled BRL3.07T ($1T) in January, down 3.9% from the same month in 2016. (rogerio.jelmayer@wsj.com)
Regulators Grant Reprieve on New Margin Requirements
US and European regulators grant a six month grace period to smaller financial firms that don't yet have paperwork ready to meet new margin requirements set to kick-in on March 1 for certain swaps transactions. Banks have complained that some of their smaller clients -- including pension funds and insurance firms -- aren't yet ready to begin posting so-called variation margin. US bank regulators and European policy makers agreed to the grace period a week after the CFTC adopted a similar move. ""The final rule incorporated a phase-in period for swap entities to begin exchanging variation margin with their swap counterparties,"" the US banking regulators said in a statement. ""The phase-in period gave markets and firms time to adjust to the new requirements, which were adopted in October 2015."" (andrew.ackerman@wsj.com; @amacker)
Bank Execs Await Loan-Loss Rule
Executives at US banks say they're getting ready for a new accounting rule that will revamp how they treat loan losses, but they expect it to cause increases in their loan impairments that will cut into their regulatory capital, a Deloitte &Touche survey says. The rule, which banks will start adopting as soon as 2019, will require them to book losses on soured loans much faster, and is expected to require some banks to set aside more in reserves for loan losses. Seventy percent of the 31 banks responding to the Deloitte survey say they've started preparations for the new approach, and majorities say they expect their impairments of mortgages, consumer loans and commercial loans to rise by at least 10%. As a result, majorities of those surveyed anticipate declines in their regulatory-capital ratios, and more than 80% expect their earnings to become more volatile under the new model.

New China Framework to Hit W-M Products
A new framework by Chinese financial regulators aims to clamp down on wealth-management products, a longtime goal of authorities. Banks have been hiding such products off their balance sheets, leaving room on their books to make more loans. NSBO Research notes wealth-management products generally banned by banking regulators from investing in commercial property. The products, though, have been able to do so ""by investing in asset-management products sold by brokers or fund companies' subsidiaries--which are not prohibited from these kind of investments"" by securities regulators. But the new framework, led by China's central bank and yet to be approved by top leaders, would ban asset-management products from investing in other ones. How effective

Chinese financial regulators have come up with a draft framework on overseeing the country's near-$9 trillion asset-management industry. Among the new requirements, firms would have put aside reserves equal to 10% of product-management fees and be barred from promising guaranteed returns. Gavekal Research describes the work a ""rare coordinated move by the People's Bank of China--together with the banking, securities and insurance regulators""--which ""signals a more-joined-up approach to financial supervision"" in China's efforts ""to curb the rapid expansion of"" shadow finance there. At the end of 2016, banks' exposure to off-balance-sheet wealth-management products totaled CNY26 trillion, 30% higher than a year earlier. ""Under the draft rules, financial institutions--which have previously found ways to arbitrage China's fragmented regulatory environment--will be subject to coordinated supervision and tighter restrictions,"" says Gavekal.

'Tailored' Accounting Takes Companies Into Alternate Reality
In these days of alternative facts , some companies are pushing alternative accounting.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is increasingly calling out companies that offer a different flavor of ""non-GAAP"" accounting--reporting their numbers as if they could calculate them using assumptions or practices not permitted under generally accepted accounting principles. This goes beyond the SEC's crusade against companies using more traditional tactics like stripping out costs from their customized measures, generally making their numbers look better than under GAAP.

Tom Perez's Bank-Friendly Record a Bad Fit for DNC
Tom Perez, the former Labor Secretary and current candidate to chair the Democratic National Committee, could ""kneecap"" the Democratic Party's quest to return to power with his ""established record of not taking on the banks,"" writes Matt Stoller for the Intercept . During his time as a high-ranking Justice Department official and as Labor secretary, Mr. Perez repeatedly declined to prosecute financial executives accused of wrongdoing, Mr. Stoller writes. The Obama administration's Justice Department focused on financial settlements rather than criminal prosecutions in these cases, a position that is out of step with the opinions of the Democratic Party's base, he says.
Over the past six months , traders of corporate loans--one of Wall Street's most manual businesses--have shaved more than 20% off the average time it takes to settle trades. This occurred without a major technological disruption to the business.
Standard Chartered PLC said its troubled principal finance unit toted up a $650 million loss last year, weighing on the bank's efforts to improve returns.
Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC reported its ninth straight annual loss but pledged an extra £750 million ($951.6 million) of costs cuts this year and said it hoped 2017 would mark the end of its decadelong restructuring.

HSBC,"Deng's Take: China's Open Markets--Much Talk, Little Action; Foreign banks must create separate companies to operate in China and face difficulties opening branches."," Feb 24, 2017",0,"After agreeing to uphold the ""One China"" policy in a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, U.S. President Donald Trump is moving closer to finally starting a discussion with Beijing over its trade and currency practices. As relations between the new administration and China take hold, however, there are several areas that Mr. Trump has yet to recognize publicly as sore points for the U.S. One of them: Wall Street firms' limited access to China's financial sector.
China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. After a five-year grace period, the country was supposed to open its doors wider to foreign banks. While that happened on paper, in reality rules have made it difficult for foreign banks to penetrate the market. The share of foreign banking operations amounted to just 1.4% of China's total banking assets in 2015, according the China Banking Regulatory Commission. It was 2.4% in 2007.
In practice, foreign banks must create separate companies to operate in China and face difficulties opening branches.
""As a result, foreign banks have almost no retail banking business, and they can't utilize their more efficient banking services to compete head to head against China's own banks,"" said Scott Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. ""There are similar constraints still in place for the securities business, credit ratings, insurance and credit cards.""
Discussions about a bilateral investment treaty started in 2008 and have dragged on without a deal. It isn't clear whether such talks will continue under Mr. Trump.
Meanwhile, repeated assurances by Chinese regulators to allow the world greater access to the country's finance industry are getting stale.
The National Development and Reform Commission made such a promise in December. Then, the State Council
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 287 of 1177
said it would ease investment curbs, including in banking, securities, futures, fund management and insurance. Its statement was published Jan. 17, the same day President Xi Jinping took to the stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Critics quickly pointed out the irony of an economic nationalist declaring China's openness to the world.
Beijing has kept its finance sector well protected because banks are its major conduit for implementing economic policy. By and large, funds flow to China's corporate sector through state-owned banks, not the securities market. A foreign commercial bank can own up to 25% of a domestic commercial bank, while a foreign investment bank can own up to 49% of a securities joint venture. For example, HSBC Holdings PLC has a 19.9% stake in Bank of Communications Co., while UBS Group AG and Morgan Stanley have been looking to increase stakes in their securities joint ventures to 49%, from about 25% and about 33%, respectively.
Other areas of finance are up for review. A December draft of revised rules for opening up markets loosened restrictions on the credit-rating industry.
Currently, foreign firms can rate domestic securities only through joint ventures--something the likes of Moody's Investors Service, Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings have been reluctant to do.
Most China observers aren't hopeful about meaningful change to the finance sector, given that Mr. Trump has focused his complaints toward China on its trade and currency practices.
""I don't see China taking a pre-emptive action to further open up its banking market to foreign banks at this stage, given already heightened trade tensions, particularly with the U.S."" said Matthew Phillips, a Hong Kong-based financial-services partner at PwC. ""Trade is going to drive the dynamic between the two countries and until China sees the lay of the land, it might not want to show its hand and further open access to a critical area.""

HSBC,World Trade Flows Grew at Slowest Pace since Financial Crisis; Signs of a modest pickup toward year-end," Feb 24, 2017",1,"International trade flows grew at the slowest pace since the financial crisis in 2016, but there were signs of a modest pickup as the year drew to a close.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 289 of 1177
The Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis said on Friday that the volume of exports and imports of goods was 1.2% higher than in 2015, marking a slowdown from the 2% rate of growth recorded in the preceding year and the smallest rise since volumes crashed in 2009.
However, there were signs exports and imports might be reviving, with volumes up 1.1% in the final three months of the year compared with the third quarter, almost double the rate of increase in the three months to September. The sluggishness of trade in 2016 partly reflected broader weakness in the demand for goods, with developed economies recording their slowest expansion since 2013 and some large developing economies still contracting. But many economists believe there are other reasons for low rates of trade growth since 2012, including the increased use of trade barriers other than tariffs and a reversal in the creation of so-called global value chains--the process by which large companies moved parts of their production and associated jobs overseas.
While trade flows are driven by global economic growth, economists have long believed they in turn boost growth and worry recent weakness is contributing to the anemic nature of the global expansion. There is growing concern about the impact on the global economy should U.S. President Donald Trump proceed with his pledge to remake trade relationships in an effort to protect jobs.
Speaking at a news conference Thursday, the head of Germany's central bank warned that protectionism would undermine prosperity everywhere .
""It is international trade and interaction that underpins our prosperity,"" Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank, said. ""Trade promotes the spread of fresh, productive ideas and new, improved products. It is therefore trade which stimulates productivity, which in turn is what drives wages higher.""
Over the longer term, world trade has usually grown at 1.5 times the rate of total economic output. During the period of rapid globalization in the 1990s, trade grew at twice the rate of economic output.
However, it appears to have grown more slowly than total output in 2016.
Despite the end-of-year pickup, trade experts see little prospect of a significant revival in trade flows in 2017.
""The rise of protectionism is more likely to accelerate than slow down,"" Raoul Leering, head of international trade research at ING Bank, said. ""The uncertainty around possible import tariffs by the U.S. also leads to a 'wait and see' attitude of companies with regard to offshoring, another driver of trade.""
Mr. Leering expects trade flows will again grow more slowly that broader economic output in 2017.
Amid much gloom, there are some positives for world trade. An international agreement to streamline the movement of goods across borders came into force Thursday, cutting trade costs by 14.3%, according to the World Trade Organization. The Trade Facilitation Agreement should make it more affordable for smaller firms to engage in trade.
""By cutting red tape and making global supply chains more secure, the TFA will undoubtedly increase flows of cross-border business, enabling more small and mid-sized businesses to reap the benefits of trade, helping to boost economic prosperity and potentially adding $1 trillion to global merchandise exports,"" Natalie Blyth, global head of trade finance at HSBC, said.

HSBC,Standard Chartered and HSBC: Small Dividends From Rising Rates; Both banks are struggling for growth; interest rates will only help a little.," Feb 24, 2017",0,"U.S. interest rate rises are good for Asia-focused banks, HSBC and Standard Chartered, but they probably won't deliver the punch that investors might hope.
When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, both banks get a boost to net interest income because they do a lot of international lending in dollars and have large businesses in Hong Kong, which follows U.S. interest rate policy directly because its currency is pegged to the dollar.
Banks globally have rallied since President Donald Trump's election win on hopes of expansionary economic policies and rising rates. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen lifted rates in December. HSBC expects two more rises in 2017. But while this will help both banks, rate rises alone are likely to add only 1% to 2% to their total revenues. Like HSBC, Standard Chartered's problem is where to find growth without taking excessive risk , or offering too much low-return corporate credit that doesn't also bring other more profitable business, such as selling bonds or cash management. Standard Chartered had a better year in 2016 than 2015, though it still reported a small full- year net loss on Friday. Bad-debt charges dropped 40% while revenues were down 11% compared with 2015. They at least rose quarter by quarter through 2016.
Profitable growth isn't easy, so higher rates are the surest route to better revenues for now. At Standard Chartered a half-point rate rise globally would add about $300 million to $400 million in net interest income, but if only U.S. rates move, the gain would be smaller. For HSBC, U.S. rates alone rising half a point would add more than $500 million in revenue.
With the Standard Chartered's 2016 revenue being $13.8 billion and HSBC's $48 billion, such additions are small beer. For investors in both banks, growth will remain hard to find.

HSBC,The World's Most Radical Experiment in Monetary Policy Isn't Working; A generation of Japanese accustomed to falling prices have diminished the impact of negative interest rates and other stimulus policies that were supposed to spur wage and price increases; 'people love to save'," Feb 26, 2017",1,"
During Japan's go-go 1980s, Hiromi Shibata once blew a month's salary on a cashmere coat, wore it a few times, then retired it. Today, her daughter's idea of a shopping spree is scrounging through her mom's closet in Shizuoka, a provincial capital.
""About a third of my wardrobe is hand-me-downs from my mom,"" says 26-year-old Nanako Shibata, who lives in Tokyo. To save on the 112-mile trip home, she rides the bus instead of the speedy bullet train, once a symbol of Japan's rise.
The U.S. appears to be leading other parts of the globe out of an extended era where central banks relied heavily on low and negative interest rates and stimulus to jump-start growth and keep prices from falling. The Federal Reserve has raised U.S. interest rates , and the European Central Bank is considering easing its stimulus.
Japan remains definitively stuck, despite a long and aggressive experiment with ultralow rates. A quarter-century after its property bubble burst, a penny-pinching generation has come of age knowing only economic malaise, stagnant wages and deflation--a condition where prices fall instead of rise.
The belief that deflation will continue has become so ingrained it has presented seemingly insurmountable challenges to monetary policy, a lesson for other countries that are traveling a similar path.
""It is hard to change the deflationary mind-set even with radical policies,"" says Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asia economics for HSBC. ""I would argue Japan will remain in its funk and will remain there for many years.""
Japan is nearly four years into a Central Bank stimulus effort involving printing trillions of yen and guiding interest rates into negative territory, perhaps the globe's most aggressive such efforts under way. Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda's shock-and-awe stimulus , launched in April 2013, fizzled after a short-lived spurt of growth and rising prices. Japan fell back into deflation last year. More recently, the inflation rate has been bouncing around near zero.
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 294 of 1177
In November, Mr. Kuroda postponed his goal of reaching 2% inflation , all but admitting he is out of ideas. He said in a series of speeches last year that an entrenched ""deflationary mind-set"" stifled hope that wages or prices will rise, limiting the impact of monetary policies such as negative rates. Mr. Kuroda declined to comment through a spokesman.
Japan's inflation rate has ticked above zero in recent months, which economists attribute to the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, a stronger dollar and higher oil prices--not economic fundamentals in Japan. Few see Japan returning to robust growth and rising prices.
Deflation is bad for an economy because it undermines economic growth. Businesses earn less, so they invest less, cut wages and stop hiring. Amid the economic uncertainty, consumers stop spending, furthering the downward spiral.
The idea behind ultralow rates is that they jolt consumers and businesses into spending by kindling inflation. But Japan's deflationary expectations have become so routine that consumers and businesses refrain from spending no matter how low the central bank goes. There is evidence, in fact, that rock-bottom rates are backfiring by frightening consumers into saving for perilous economic times, not spending.
In an era of central-bank improvisation, no other nation has pushed the envelope as much. The Bank of Japan was the first to lower its benchmark rate to near zero in 1999, long before Europe, the U.K. and the U.S. did so in response to the 2008 financial crisis. In 2001, Japan began flooding its financial system with cash to try to spur inflation and growth, a practice called quantitative easing that was later adopted in the West.
Mr. Kuroda in 2013 began pumping so much money into the financial system--eventually around $700 billion a year--that some investors worried hyperinflation or asset bubbles would form. That hasn't happened. Last year, the Bank of Japan followed the European Central Bank in guiding rates into negative territory, a radical attempt to force banks to lend more money by making it costly if they don't.
Japan's predicament today was almost unthinkable during its 1980s boom, when Japanese tycoons bought trophy properties such as New York's Rockefeller Center and Tokyo real-estate prices were the world's highest. In 1989, Japan initiated interest-rate hikes that popped real-estate and stock-market bubbles.
Since then, annual growth has averaged less than 1% amid periodic recessions. Prices began falling in the late 1990s.
Japan's economy dropped to the world's third-largest after fast-growing China surpassed it as No. 2. The Nikkei stock-market average is around half its 1989 peak. Property prices have fallen broadly for a quarter of a century. Frozen-dessert maker Akagi Nyugyo ran an apologetic advertisement last year after implementing a 9 cent increase, its first in 25 years. Japanese companies are sitting on nearly $2 trillion in cash, idle money that officials contend should be invested in Japan.
The deflationary landscape is deeply imprinted on the 20 million Japanese between ages 20 and 34 who grew up after prices started falling. Wage increases, rising stocks or banks that pay decent interest on deposits are all hypotheticals to them. They live in a world where anything they buy today might be had for less tomorrow. Their instinct is to do the safe thing and economize.
They reject the consumerism of their parents' generation as excess. Some live with roommates in group homes, a new phenomenon for Japan, and dine on $3 beef bowls. If they spend on anything, it is travel. In a deflationary society, experiences don't lose value, while anything you buy does.
Some older Japanese who knew the privations of the postwar years see a worrisome lack of ambition in younger people. Japan uses the term ""neets"" to describe young people ""not in education, employment or training,"" while ""freeters"" work unstable part-time or contract jobs. Japanese ""parasite singles"" never leave their parents' home, and women complain about ""herbivore men"" uninterested in the opposite sex.
""Their problem is they are too comfortable,"" says Heizo Takenaka, a former economy minister. ""Their expectations are low. We wanted to own the excellent cars. But they don't seem to want to.""
Many economists believed the Bank of Japan's 2013 stimulus would be enough to jolt the nation out of its downward spiral of weak growth and falling prices. Mr. Kuroda and others in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's

government point to an initial burst of inflation and growth as signs the stimulus will eventually work. Others say the monetary policies worked until they were undermined by a 2014 sales-tax increase.
A Bank of Japan survey in October found only 5% of respondents planned to spend more next year, while 48% intended to cut.
Keita Kameyama, a 30-year-old civil servant in Kagawa, a rural province, has been saving around 25% of his $40,000 salary each year to eventually marry his longtime girlfriend. He lives at home with his mother, drives an old Honda and rarely shops.
The central bank's stimulus measures had no effect on Mr. Kameyama's spending. He still salts away his money in plain-vanilla bank accounts. He fears Japan's long stagnation will wipe out his pension, and worries he won't have enough money to care for his mother--a growing concern in a country with twice as many people over 60 than between 20 and 34.
He sees bank accounts, which offer minuscule interest rates on deposits despite negative short-term rates, as the only way to save. Hyakujushi Bank, Ltd. the biggest in Kagawa, pays only 0.05% on deposits and has paid less than 1% since 1995.
""People in Kagawa love to save,"" says Mr. Kameyama. ""I have heard [the Bank of Japan] is trying very hard to get people to spend their money, but I don't think I will be opening my wallet.""
Many young Japanese economize because they simply don't have enough money. More are working low-paying and temporary jobs with no benefits.
""Companies aren't growing, and they have aging workforces that they can't fire,"" says Takuji Okubo, an economist and founder of the Japan Macro Advisors research group. ""So there's no room to hire young people.""
Automobile, beer and cosmetics firms have slashed young-adult advertising and market to retirees instead, says Yohei Harada, head of the youth-marketing unit at Tokyo advertising agency Hakuhodo Inc. ""The role of parents and children is getting reversed, where the parents from the bubble generation still act like children and want to buy the fancy car, while their children in the post-bubble generation worry about their parents' spending,"" he says. Takashi Saito, a 33-year-old unmarried entrepreneur, was living in group apartment in Tokyo in 2015 when he decided to start a business.

For $45 a month, clients rent three articles of clothing at a time, which they can return for others when they like.
Mr. Saito thought it would be easy to get a loan because Japan's low-rate policies are meant to spur banks to lend more to small businesses. It wasn't.
He asked Japan Finance Corp., a state-owned institution set up to lend to small businesses, for $200,000. After much haggling, he got less than $50,000. A year later, as the business grew, he asked for more. He was rejected. Japan Finance Corp. declined to comment.
Bank analysts say Japanese lenders have become more conservative, particularly with startup companies that have no collateral, because low rates cut into profits. In the 11-months after Japan's rates went negative last year, Japan Finance Corp.'s loan portfolio shrank.
Mr. Saito raided savings, borrowed from family and is hoping for venture capital.
Japanese clothing brand Uniqlo became a hit in the deflation era, appealing to a nation of penny pinchers with inexpensive casual wear. But customers stopped buying Uniqlo after price increases in 2015, forcing the retailer to cut prices to win back sales.
Uniqlo founder Tadashi Yanai blames negative rates and other central bank policies, such as quantitative easing, for worrying consumers. ""It's anxiety about the future,"" he said in an interview. ""They have to stop negative rates. That's idiotic.""
J.P. Morgan Chase &Co.'s Japan economist, Masaaki Kanno, says the deflation mind-set is entrenched because it is rational. With wages unchanged for 25 years, young adults don't believe they will earn more in the future.
Some economists contend the government should try even more fiscal stimulus and monetary easing. Others argue the stimulus has already saddled Japan with so much debt--now 230% of gross domestic product--that it

Ms. Shibata, the Tokyo resident who raids her mother's closet, recently cut her hours at a job-placement service to three days a week. To do so, she moved into an apartment that rents for half what she was paying. She has stopped shopping altogether. She sees no point in pouring her time into a career. She is pursuing contemporary dance instead.

HSBC,Lafarge Holcim Rally Could Rock On," Feb 27, 2017",0,"LAFARGEHOLCIM'S SHARES HAVE JUMPED more than 50% since Barron's wrote a positive piece on the global cement and aggregates giant a year ago (""European Cement Giant LafargeHolcim Looks Rock- Solid,"" Feb. 20). The stock, now 55.65 Swiss francs ($55.24), could rally another 25% if management maintains its focus on capital discipline and keeps a pledge to return more cash to shareholders.
LafargeHolcim (ticker: LHN.Switzerland), based in Jona, Switzerland, could also get a liftfrom an upturn in global cement markets in 2017. HSBC forecasts cement volumes will be ""meaningfully higher"" this year in emerging markets, North America, and Europe, the first time since 2008-09 that all three regions could be headed in the same direction. Lafarge- Holcim might be a big beneficiary of a U.S. construction boom inspired by the policies of President Donald Trump.
HSBC analyst John Fraser-Andrews expects LafargeHolcim to have a freecash- flow yield of more than 12% by 2019, up from a projected 6.6% last year. The company could have an estimated CHF1.97 billion in surplus cash in 2018-19, which could help fund a planned CHF1 billion stock buyback and special dividends, together totaling 6% of its market capitalization.
LafargeHolcim management, led by CEO Eric Olsen, has wrung synergies ahead of schedule from the 2015 merger of France's Lafarge and Switzerland's Holcim. The company achieved its 2016 synergy goal of CHF450 million in the third quarter, and then added another CHF100 million to the annual target. LafargeHolcim is expected to report next week that it earned CHF1.49 billion, or CHF2.52 a share, for 2016, on revenue of CHF27.43 billion. Earnings could rise to CHF3.06 a share this year, and CHF3.88 in 2018, buttressing the case for more stock market gains. -"
HSBC,"Growth Is in the Cards-and Chips, and Phones"," Feb 27, 2017",0,"The decline of cash has created lucrative new opportunities for Global Payments,aprovider of payment-processing technology and services.Memoto shareholders: The party isn't over.
DESPITE THE PROLIFERATION OF CREDIT cards and mobile-payment apps, 85% of the world's transactions still rely on cash. That is a potential gold mine for companies such as Global Payments, which are facilitating the shiftaway from paper money. McKinsey Global Institute expects the global payment industry to generate $2.2 trillion in revenue by 2020, up 22% from 2015.
Global Payments (ticker: GPN) provides technology and services to help small and midsize merchants process more than seven billion electronic transactions a year. The Atlanta-based outfit has grown in recent years through acquisitions and partnerships, and generates about 30% of its revenue outside North America, including 9% in the United Kingdom.
Global Payments shares have more than tripled in the past five years, to $78, although the stock has been flat for nine months, partly due to concerns about the impact of the U.K.'s pending exit from the European Union. Yet some analysts see potential upside of 15% in the year ahead, based on industry trends and the company's integration of Heartland Payment Systems, a smaller rival that it purchased in early 2016 for around $4 billion.
Global Payments is expected to earn $543 million, or $3.56 a share, in the fiscal year ending in May, on revenue of $3.3 billion, with earnings jumping to $4.20 a share in 2018. (The company converted on Jan. 1 to a calendar year, but analysts won't update estimates until it files an amended 10K, probably this week.) Shares trade for 18.6 times
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 300 of 1177
Wall Street's 2018 consensus earnings estimate, just above rival Vantiv's (VNTV) price/earnings ratio of 18.2. First Data (FDC), another rival, fetches 10 times 2018 estimates; it has a wider range of businesses.
Steven Kwok, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette&Woods, thinks that Global Payments could command up to 22 times his fiscal-2018 earnings target of $4.15 a share in the next year, implying a stock price around $90.
Kwok argues that currency fluctuations are masking the underlying growth of the business, and notes that the midpoint of management's 2017 earnings-guidance range assumes a 24% increase, year over year, excluding currency effects. Much of the advance stems from the Heartland deal, which could lead to cost savings of $135 million and help Global Payments add new customers and services.
Until five years ago, Global Payments and its rivals chiefly provided merchants with software to connect to credit- card networks. The business, facilitated by independent sales organizations, was easy to replicate, and vendors competed largely on price. With margins eroding, the company switched to a direct-sales model, allowing for closer relationships with clients. Global Payments also beefed up its investment in technology and data analytics, to help merchants better handle e-commerce and mobile payments and run loyalty programs.
To aid the transition, CEO Jeffrey Sloan, a former Goldman Sachs banker, bought up smaller payment-technology companies. With the Heartland deal, Global Payments acquired a large direct-sales organization, swelling its sales team to 1,500 people from fewer than 100. Today, the wholesale business accounts for less than 10% of revenue, while direct sales contribute 60%. Merchants typically pay Global Payments a fee per transaction, or a percentage of the amount processed.
The rest of Global Payments' revenue comes from integrating payment-processing systems into software used by customers to handle routine financial tasks, such as billing and inventory management. This business, which involves partnerships with more than 2,000 software vendors, didn't exist five years ago, but is critical to the company's future, not least because it facilitates customer retention. The softwareintegration business has been expanding at a midteens rate, and analysts expect it to generate about half of total revenue in a couple of years.
Global Payments' transition has led to a steady increase in operating profit margins. It forecasts a near-1% improvement this year, suggesting margins of 30%-plus. ""We are just getting going,"" Sloan says.
An investment in more services and a hefty sales force looks well timed. If the U.S. economy continues to strengthen, transaction volume could grow, encouraging smaller and midsize businesses to invest in payment- processing upgrades that larger merchants already have undertaken, says Moshe Katri, an analyst at Wedbush.
Global Payments also could enjoy more pricing power. Heartland typically operated as the low-cost option for customers such as restaurants, leaving room to liftprices gradually. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Christopher Brendler estimates that repricing could add up to four percentage points of revenue growth a year through 2019. The Heartland deal also will boost Global Payments' e-commerce business, which accounts for about 10% of U.S. sales. Sloan says he wants to double it in the next few years.
While investors have penalized Global Payments for international exposure, that gives the company a long-term advantage over rivals such as Vantiv, which has yet to push abroad. Global Payments has focused on striking deals with large non-U.S. banks, including HSBC (HSBC) in the U.K. and Asia, and Erste Group Bank (EBS.Austria) in Eastern Europe, to gain market share. Sloan wants to expand in India and China, and also move into Japan.

Global Payments could produce $773 million of free cash flow this year. While the company pays a dividend of four cents a share, it has used its cash chiefly to trim net debt, now around $3.8 billion, and make acquisitions. Analysts expect Global Payments to strike more deals in 2018, possibly for non-U.S. companies. That could liftrevenue and ignite the shares.

The Bottom Line
Global Payments could have 15% upside, to $90, as revenue and profits increase. The company is expected to benefit from cost savings and pricing power.
""We are just getting going,"" says CEO Jeffrey Sloan of Global Payment's rising profit margins.

HSBC,"British Land, Oxford Properties Close to Selling London's 'Cheesegrater' Skyscraper; The companies are in advanced talks to sell the Leadenhall Building"," Feb 28, 2017",1,"
British Land PLC and Oxford Properties Group are close to completing the sale of a prominent London skyscraper in what would be one of the city's biggest ever property deals.
The companies on Tuesday said they were in advanced talks to sell the Leadenhall Building, known as the Cheesegrater for its triangular shape. The building is a joint venture between British Land, one of the U.K.'s biggest landlords, and Oxford Properties, the real-estate arm of Canadian pension fund OMERS.
Analysts for months have expected British Land to sell its 50% stake in the building to fund other projects and lower its level of debt. But now both owners are discussing a sale. Chinese buyers reportedly have been leading in
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 303 of 1177
the bidding process.
Britain's decision to leave the European Union has contributed to a collapse in property transactions over the past year. But investors from China and Hong Kong have become increasingly active.
A fall in the value of sterling against the yuan, as well as relatively strong returns in London, have made London real estate more attractive to Chinese investors .
Economic and political factors in China and Hong Kong--such as worries parts of the property market are overheated, and the possibility Beijing could impose more stringent curbs on outbound capital flows--have also spurred the buying spree.
British Land and Oxford Properties ""are in advanced discussions regarding the possible sale of their interests in the Leadenhall Building,"" a statement from the U.K. real-estate investment trust said.
""It is not certain that these discussions will lead to a sale of the building,"" the statement said.
A sale could be the biggest real-estate transaction in London since Qatar's sovereign-wealth fund bought the London headquarters of HSBC Holdings PLC for over £1.1 billion in 2014. The deal, for a skyscraper in the city's Canary Wharf financial district, was the biggest-ever sale of a single building in the U.K. capital.

HSBC,London's 'Cheesegrater' Sold to Chinese Firm for $1.4 Billion; Weaker pound against the yuan reignites Asian interest in property in the city," Mar 1, 2017",1,"CC Land Holdings Ltd, backed by a Hong Kong property tycoon, has agreed to pay £1.15 billion ($1.42 billion) for a London skyscraper in one of the city's biggest ever real estate deals.
British Land PLC and Oxford Properties Group, the real-estate arm of Canadian pension fund OMERS, said Wednesday that they sold the Leadenhall Building, known locally as the Cheesegrater for its triangular shape. Investment in London property from China and Hong Kong has surged in recent months. A weak pound versus the yuan, alongside economic and political pressures at home , have been driving the acquisition spree.
CC Land Holdings, controlled by Cheung Chung Kiu, bought a different London office building for £292 million earlier this year.
At 736 feet, the Cheesegrater is the tallest tower in London's main financial district. It was valued at £915 million at the end of September.
The deal is the biggest transaction of a single London building since Qatar's sovereign-wealth fund bought the London headquarters of HSBC Holdings PLC for over £1.1 billion in 2014.

Investors from China and Hong Kong bought more than £3 billion of central London property last year, more than those from the U.S. or Europe, according to real-estate broker JLL.
The influx stands out because U.K. property transaction volumes have fallen sharply in the last year. Britain's decision to leave the European Union , as well as high prices following a multi-year property boom, have made some overseas investors wary of current values.
But for Chinese investors, London property looks much different.
Currency has been a big factor. While the yuan has lost value against the dollar, it is up 12% versus sterling since the Brexit vote last June, making assets in the U.K. a bargain.
Yields on London property are also attractive relative to those in Hong Kong, a boon for investors hunting for returns in an environment of ultra-low interest rates at global central banks.
The average capitalization rate--a measure of yield--on offices in the City of London was 4.6% at the end of last year, according to Real Capital Analytics. In Hong Kong, the yield on offices was just 2.6%.
Worries that the Chinese property market is overheated , and the possibility that Beijing could impose more stringent curbs on outbound capital flows from China is also speeding efforts to invest overseas, further driving demand for London property.
Analysts for months have expected British Land to sell its 50% stake in the Cheesegrater. British Land said Wednesday it will use the money from the sale to pay down its debt.
The Cheesegrater's 46 floors of office space are fully let. Completed in the summer of 2014, the building's angled design stems from local planning requirements that preserve views of St. Paul's Cathedral from certain vantage points.
""This sale shows continued investor appetite for best in class, well located property in London,"" said Tim Roberts, head of offices and residential at British Land, in a statement.

HSBC,Eurozone Inflation Rises Above ECB's Target; Consumer prices were 2.0% higher in February," Mar 2, 2017",1,"The annual rate of inflation in the eurozone rose above the European Central Bank's target for the first time in four years during February, driven higher by another rise in energy prices.
The move above the ECB's target of close to, but below, 2% completes a big turnaround for the inflation measure.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 307 of 1177
As recently as May of last year, consumer prices were below their levels of a year earlier, and the 1% level was breached for the first time in more than three years as recently as December.
However, the surge in inflation is unlikely to prompt a big change soon in the ECB's policy . Policy makers, including ECB President Mario Draghi, have been at pains over recent weeks to stress that they have yet to be convinced that the current rate of inflation will be sustained when the rise in energy prices comes to a halt.
""If oil prices stay at the current levels, February should mark the peak in inflation for this year,"" said Fabio Balboni, an economist at HSBC. ""So Mario Draghi should be able to fend off pressures for the ECB to start tapering QE at the upcoming ECB meeting on 9 March.""
In December, the ECB announced an extension of its bond-buying program, which is known as quantitative easing, to the end of this year from a tentatively scheduled conclusion in March, though it reduced the monthly value of purchases.
The European Union's statistics agency Thursday said consumer prices were 2.0% higher in February than in the same month a year earlier, the highest rate of inflation since January 2013 and a pickup from 1.8% in January 2017.
However, that acceleration was mostly down to a 9.2% rise in energy and a 5.2% rise in food prices over the year. The core measure of inflation--which strips out items such as energy and food--was unchanged at 0.9%, while prices of manufactured goods rose at a slower pace than in January.
The rise in the headline rate of inflation will likely amplify calls from some parts of the eurozone for an unwinding of the stimulus measures launched since June 2014, when the currency area seemed at risk of slipping into long period of deflation.
German politicians and economists have been lining up in recent weeks to call for a policy change from Frankfurt, worried that the combination of higher inflation and rock-bottom interest rates will hurt the nation's savers. Speaking Wednesday, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann suggested he would prefer that less stimulus were deployed , and urged his fellow policy makers not to wait too long before removing it.
""The hawks on the council will point to the headline rate of 2% and suggest that it is sufficient justification for a less accommodative stance of monetary policy,"" said James Athey, a money manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. ""Conversely, Draghi and some of the more dovish council members will reference core CPI at a mere 0.9% and suggest that the headline rate overstates the health of the economy so should be looked through."" Important in translating the recent rise in energy prices into a sustained boost to inflation is what central bankers call ""second-round effects,"" which occur when businesses raise their charges to cover higher costs, and when workers secure higher wage increases to protect their real spending power.
There are some signs that businesses are beginning to respond to a rise in their energy bills. According to a survey of 3,000 companies by data firm IHS Markit, eurozone manufacturers raised their prices at the fastest rate in over 51?2 years during February as their costs jumped.
""Not only are higher commodity prices and the weak euro pushing up firms' costs, but there's also growing evidence of a sellers' market developing for many goods as demand exceeds supply, which suggests core inflationary pressures may be starting to rise,"" said Chris Williamson, IHS Markit's chief business economist.
The February pickup in the eurozone is a fresh sign that the global economy is emerging from a long period of deflationary pressure marked by excess capacity in factories and labor markets. On Wednesday, the U.S. Commerce Department reported the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure rose to 1.9% in January, the highest level since 2012.
Figures also released by Eurostat Thursday showed the prices of goods leaving the eurozone's factory gates were 3.5% higher than a year earlier, the largest annual rise since March 2012. Excluding energy providers, prices rose by 1.5%, a sign that underlying inflationary pressures are building, if modestly.
With unemployment still high, a significant rise in pay deals seems unlikely over coming months. Eurostat Thursday said the jobless rate was unchanged at 9.6% in January, although 56,000 fewer people were without work. Over the 12 months to January, the number of unemployed workers fell by 1.1 million, but that still left 15.6

million without jobs, roughly equivalent to the population of the Netherlands, the eurozone's fifth largest member. The ECB may need to see a further strengthening of the jobs market before it can be sure that inflation is on course to rise to and stay at its target. And that may take a while.
""Unemployment is so high, it could take years to get down to a level consistent with inflation rising,"" said David Owen, chief European economist at Jefferies.

The South Korean company is looking to list its Malaysian subsidiary, Lotte Chemical Titan, in the late second quarter or early third quarter of this year. If successful, the IPO will be the biggest such offering in nearly two years. Plans to list Lotte Chemical Titan last year were delayed after South Korean prosecutors charged the parent's chairman and four of his family members with tax evasion, embezzlement and illegal business deals . The chairman's sister was sentenced to three years in prison in January. The conglomerate was also forced to scrap the IPO of the group's hotel unit, Hotel Lotte Co., last year.

HSBC,Foreign Investors Spurn China's Markets; Concerns ranging from tight capital controls to a lack of transparency to expensive valuations have kept money managers on the sidelines," Mar 2, 2017",0,"SHANGHAI--China is opening its financial markets more than ever to global investors, hoping the charm offensive will attract more money just as it struggles to stem heavy capital withdrawals.
The expected gusher of funds hasn't materialized.
In just over 12 months, China has opened its $9 trillion bond market to overseas investors and launched a trading link between the Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock markets that allows foreigners to trade the shares of some of the country's fastest-expanding companies. This week, Chinese regulators allowed overseas investors in its bond
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 312 of 1177
market to buy financial products traded domestically that will let them hedge currency risks.
But while foreigners may have long sought to invest in stocks and bonds in China, where annual economic growth is near 7%, as the last great frontier in global markets, they have so far been hesitant.
Overseas investors' Chinese bondholdings dropped to 1.3% of the total outstanding by the end of last year, a fall from 1.4% before the market's broad opening in February 2016. Money flowing into Shenzhen stocks from Hong Kong has been tepid, averaging just 5% of the daily 13 billion yuan ($1.89 billion) quota allowed in February. The trend is similar for a trading link between Shanghai and Hong Kong set up in 2014.
Investors cite several worries, including time-consuming registration processes and confusion over the tax rules on capital gains. Some said markets in China are too expensive. Shares on Shenzhen's small-cap ChiNext board trade at 71 times earnings. The yuan's slide in the past year has put off many, even though the slump has paused recently.
Others refer to regular state interventions in markets, such as the heavy share-buying by government-backed funds whenever Chinese stocks dip. Another worry: whether, given China's tight capital controls, investors will be able to get their money out of China as readily as it is being welcomed in.
""There's a risk that at any point the authorities can step in. That risk must be compensated for foreign investors, for example, by a cheaper market,"" said Lukas Daalder, chief investment officer at Robeco Investment Solutions in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.
For China, where monthly capital withdrawals are roughly $30 billion to $60 billion, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts, there is a big potential prize from further opening up its markets.
Stock-index provider MSCI Inc. has kept mainland-listed Chinese stocks out of its key indexes, citing concerns such as restrictions on capital withdrawals. Some $500 billion could in time pour into Chinese shares, about 10% of the market's total value, if they were included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, HSBC Holdings PLC analysts estimated last summer.
Chinese bonds, meanwhile, aren't included in major bond indexes run by banks like J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. and Citigroup Inc. that are commonly tracked by global fund managers, partly because of concerns about issues like market regulation and capital controls. Goldman reckons some $250 billion could eventually flow into Chinese debt markets if the bonds were admitted.
Some investors who have been eager to jump into China said regulators' latest move to give them more ability to hedge risks resolved a big hang-up.
""Now we are ready, we are finalizing"" plans to invest in the onshore market, said Jean-Charles Sambor, deputy head of emerging-market fixed income at BNP Paribas Investment Partners in London, which manages [euro]560 billion ($591 billion). ""Regulatory issues are gradually being clarified; we are much more comfortable.""
Still, few foreign asset managers have created funds dedicated to China's onshore bond market, said Chantal Grinderslev, senior adviser at Z-Ben Advisors, a Shanghai-based strategic consultant, given a lack of demand from investors. Exceptions include U.S.-based hedge fund Bridgewater Associates LP, which has registered seven products to invest in Chinese bonds. A Bridgewater spokesman said the fund is ""looking forward to investing in China and are moving forward to do that."".
""No one wants to be at a cocktail party saying they don't have a China strategy,"" said Ms. Grinderslev. ""But for the majority of firms, it's more lip service than action.""
U.K.-based Standard Life Investments is typical of major investment funds keeping their China powder dry. A big turnoff is Chinese regulators' lack of transparency, said Mark Baker, an emerging-market portfolio manager at the firm in Hong Kong, adding that currently unfavorable market conditions--from rising inflation, which hurts bondholders by eating away at the value of future payments, to a weakening currency--have taken away any urgency to invest in China.
""It doesn't really feel like a slam-dunk trade at the moment,"" said Mr. Baker. ""We're just not there banging the table asking for access on the basis of the investment opportunity alone.""
Wayne Bowers, executive vice president of Northern Trust Asset Management, which manages $942 billion, said
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 313 of 1177

another concern is the absence of a level playing field between domestic and foreign firms in the country. ""One of the questions we ask on a regular basis is how I am going to be treated both in terms of liquidity, withholding tax and underlying regulatory oversight,"" said Mr. Bowers.

HSBC,The Big Losers From Investment Banking's Shrinking Pie; The banks still reshaping their books and strategies are falling behind," Mar 3, 2017",0,"The global investment banking pie is shrinking and what is worse, Europeans are getting a thinner share. Investment banking and trading revenue fell in 2016 for the fourth year in a row, according to Coalition, an independent research firm. Revenue has shrunk on average more than 3% a year since 2012.
But many of Europe's biggest investment banks are doing worse than this. They may have reported big recoveries in fourth-quarter activity, but the last three months of 2015 were a washout, so the comparison was generous. More importantly, the Europeans still lagged behind U.S. rivals, suggesting they continue to lose market share. Part of the problem is that they are still shrinking their balance sheets or increasing their capital--or both--long after their U.S. rivals have made these adjustments.
The European investment banks that were biggest in the past are still struggling most with profitability. It is the second-tier investment banks that are reporting better returns, according to Goldman Sachs analysts: BNP Paribas, HSBC and Socie?te? Ge?ne?rale. One big reason: they are paying out less in penalties for past wrongdoing. In revenue terms, the picture is more mixed, but one thing is clear: almost all the Europeans are finding it tough to attract business while being stingier with their capital, or taking less risk.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 317 of 1177
One way to track this is to look at the amount of quarterly revenue they produce per dollar, or euro, or Swiss franc of risk-weighted assets they have in their investment bank and markets divisions.
The bigger investment banks, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and UBS, all finished 2016 producing less revenue per unit of risk than they did at the start of 2015. Deutsche did by far the worst with the last quarter of last year being almost 40% worse than the first quarter of 2015. The German bank has by far the largest restructuring job on its hands and has lost clients due to concerns about its stability.
Credit Suisse and UBS, lost 24% and 31% respectively. They had a particularly strong start to 2015 due to activity generated by the Swiss National Bank's shock move to delink its currency from the dollar. But take the second quarter of 2015 as the starting point to adjust for this and both banks' revenue per unit of risk is still down more than 20%.
In fact, of all seven banks, only HSBC did better in the final quarter of 2016 than at the start of 2015, suggesting it is capturing investment banking activity from rivals.
U.S. banks are helped by America's capital markets being bigger, deeper and recovering more rapidly, while Europe's remain slow and Asia's more dependent upon a fickle class of wealthy individuals. President Donald Trump looks likely to loosen regulatory reins, giving U.S. banks even more boost. Unless Europeans get better at sweating the capital they have, they will continue to lose ground.

Hurdle to Deregulation--Banks Are Doing Well
Republicans have been waiting since 2010 to make wholesale changes to the Dodd-Frank Act--but now, when they finally control both the White House and Congress, they are running up against an unexpected political challenge: a good portion of the financial sector is doing just fine.
For years, Republicans' case for major changes to financial regulatory policy has been buoyed by adverse lending and credit conditions. But of late, many banking indicators have been quite positive.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. released data this week showing the U.S. banking industry's annual profits hit a record in 2016 . A survey from the National Federation of Independent Business , cited by Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen in her testimony on Capitol Hill last month, found that just 2% of small business owners surveyed cited credit access as a problem. And U.S. bank-loan growth has outpaced GDP growth since 2011, according to Fitch Ratings.
""We have seen healthy growth in actual lending in the economy,"" Ms. Yellen said at the hearing .
Of course, the picture isn't all rosy. Small-business lending in June 2016 was down by nearly $100 billion from
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 320 of 1177
June 2008. The number of community banks, which provide more than half of small-business loan volume, has declined by roughly 28% since the financial crisis.
Based on that, Paul Kupiec of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, reaches a profoundly different conclusion than Ms. Yellen: ""The data tell us that, overall, bank lending growth remains anemic.""
It's true the available data allow for different, but both fact-based, conclusions about the current overall credit landscape.
Still, even the most vociferous defenders of Dodd-Frank--including the Senate Banking Committee's top Democrat, Sherrod Brown--support tweaking aspects to provide for community-bank relief.
It will be far more difficult to win support for changes to the regulatory regime for large banks, for several reasons: Democrats, including red-state senators who are up for re-election in 2018, have little to gain by supporting such changes. Additionally, the banks themselves are lukewarm toward--if not opposed to--a large-scale overhaul of regulations they have spent millions to comply with over the past several years. And with a ready-made attack-ad soundbite about how banks had record profits in 2016, many Republicans may find that their energy is better spent on more popular priorities, like revamping the tax code or making changes to the Affordable Care Act.
It's already becoming clear that financial deregulation isn't a top priority for Congress or the White House. It went unmentioned during President Donald Trump's address to Congress this week, and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill continue to delay their plans to introduce Dodd-Frank overhaul legislation.
Republican leaders are well aware that the window for passing major legislation is short and political capital is not unlimited. It's unclear whether financial deregulation will make the cut.
Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond
SEC's Piwowar: Obama-Era Retirement-Savings Rule Boon for Trial Lawyers
By Dave Michaels
WASHINGTON--The acting head of the Securities and Exchange Commission blasted a regulation opposed by stockbrokers and the Trump administration, saying the rule was written to ""increase profits"" for trial lawyers.
Michael Piwowar Thursday added his voice to a strident debate over the future of the retirement-savings regulation known as the ""fiduciary"" rule. The Labor Department plans to delay the rule by 60 days, setting the stage for its repeal or considerable revision.
Mr. Piwowar said the rule was ""highly political"" and was ""never about investor protection.""
The regulation, widely opposed by Republicans in Congress, would hold brokers to a higher standard when they advise investors saving for retirement. Under the rule, investors using individual retirement accounts would have a new right to sue brokers who don't adhere to the best-interest standard. Wall Street groups have said the SEC should have written the rule because the agency oversees all of Wall Street, not only retirement accounts such as IRAs and 401Ks.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 321 of 1177

""I have a very nuanced view of the DOL fiduciary-duty rule,"" Mr. Piwowar said at a conference sponsored by the Investment Adviser Association. ""I think it is a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad rule.""
Mr. Piwowar's comments show how unlikely the SEC is to propose stricter standards for brokers even if the Labor Department's effort is rescinded.
If the SEC were to draft its own version of the rule, the commission should focus its efforts much more narrowly, perhaps by restricting the practice of brokers holding themselves out as ""financial advisers,"" Mr. Piwowar said. The title may confuse investors who don't understand that the person might be a broker, not an investment adviser, who is held to a higher standard under the law, he said.
""If someone calls themselves a financial adviser, that means absolutely nothing,"" he said.
Under federal law, investment advisers must put their clients' interest ahead of their own financial gain. Brokers are held to a lower standard of care, known as suitability, that says investment recommendations must fit a client's goals or risk tolerance.
Mr. Piwowar also said he wasn't ""enamored with"" a proposal--floated by former Chairman Mary Jo White--to outsource some exams of investment advisers.
Lacking enough manpower, the SEC only examines about 11% of all advisers annually for compliance with federal securities laws. The SEC has never examined thousands of money managers it oversees, despite adding scores of examiners and doubling its spending over the last 13 years.
Using outside examiners, such as audit firms, would require the SEC to beef up its own oversight of those third parties, he said.
""It's not a free lunch,"" he said.
Morgan Stanley's Revised Capital Plan Approved by Fed By Ryan Tracy
WASHINGTON-- Morgan Stanley received approval from the Federal Reserve for a revised plan to return capital to shareholders, a positive development for the bank after the central bank rebuked its planning processes in last year's ""stress tests.""
The bank was the only top U.S. firm in 2016 not to receive full approval from the Fed for its plans to return capital to shareholders as part of the annual tests. The Fed gave Morgan Stanley a ""conditional non-objection"" to its capital plan, meaning the firm had to resubmit a plan to address the regulator's perceived shortcomings. The Fed said at the time that Morgan Stanley's capital planning process ""exhibited material weaknesses.""
On Thursday the Fed said it had approved the resubmitted plan ""as a result of progress made by the firm in addressing deficiencies."" The stress-testing exercise is already under way again this year for Morgan Stanley and other banks, with results likely in June.
WSJ Pro: CFPB Chief Puts Credit-Reporting Firms on Notice
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 322 of 1177

By Yuka Hayashi
WASHINGTON--The head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Thursday urged credit-reporting companies to improve how they resolve disputes with consumers and vowed to keep scrutinizing the accuracy and quality of credit reports.
CFPB Director Richard Cordray said credit-reporting firms as well as companies that furnish information to them, such as banks and credit-card companies, must make investments to upgrade their systems so they can better identify and correct errors in reports and respond to consumer inquiries and complaints.
The warning follows the CFPB's January enforcement action against two major credit-reporting companies, Equifax Inc. and TransUnion, over alleged deceptive marketing and selling of credit scores to customers. The two companies agreed to settle the claims by collectively paying more than $17.6 million in restitution to consumers and $5.5 million in fines, without admitting or denying the CFPB's findings.
Credit-reporting companies track consumers' credit history and produce reports used by financial companies to determine their eligibility to take out mortgages and auto loans, and in some instances even to get a job.
Signaling its intention to police the industry closely, the watchdog agency on Thursday released a report detailing what its examiners look for while conducting examinations and highlighting problems uncovered in the sector. And as a way to improve consumers' access to credit reports, the agency expanded its Open Credit Score Initiative by releasing a list of companies that offer credit-card customers--and sometimes the general public--free access to credit scores.
""The era of 'dispute purgatory,' where consumers have to spend months or even years making repeated efforts to dispute inaccurate, negative information in order to get someone's attention, should become a thing of the past,"" Mr. Cordray said at a meeting of the bureau's advisory board members representing industry and consumer groups.
The CFPB, established after the financial crisis to improve consumer protection, in 2012 became the first government agency to supervise the national consumer-credit-reporting companies. They are among the financial- servicing companies that cater to banks and other financial firms, where consumers cannot ""vote with their feet"" by choosing another provider when they are dissatisfied. The CFPB has recently ratcheted up scrutiny of these sectors, including mortgage and student-loan servicing companies.
As of Feb. 1, the CFPB has handled 185,700 complaints from consumers related to credit-reporting firms, accounting for one in six complaints it receives.
SEC Civil Claims Against Texas Attorney General Are Dismissed By Dave Michaels
A federal judge dismissed civil claims that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton defrauded investors by recruiting them to invest in a technology company without disclosing he was being compensated to promote the company's stock.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 323 of 1177

U.S. District Judge Amos Mazzant dealt the Securities and Exchange Commission a wholesale defeat in an opinion that rejected every claim it made about the legality of Mr. Paxton's conduct. Judge Mazzant found Mr. Paxton didn't have a duty to tell investors he got shares in the company, Servergy Inc., in exchange for raising $840,000 in investor funds.
""Paxton's conduct simply does not give rise to liability under federal securities laws,"" Judge Mazzant wrote.
""I have maintained all along this whole saga is a political witch hunt,"" Mr. Paxton said in a written statement. ""Today's ruling...confirms that these charges were baseless when the SEC initially brought them.""
SEC spokesman John Nester declined to comment.
The alleged violations took place before Mr. Paxton's election as attorney general, dating to a time when he was a state lawmaker representing a suburban Dallas district. Since being elected attorney general in 2015, Mr. Paxton has continued a tradition among Republican state officeholders of suing the U.S. government over federal policies and laws he disputes, such as challenging former President Barack Obama's plan to defer deportation of several million people in the country illegally.
The SEC case against Mr. Paxton turned on the regulator's claim that he had a fiduciary duty to disclose his compensation to people he recruited as investors, including members of a private investment club. The SEC argued Mr. Paxton's relationship with the group--he was a member of it--meant that he should have told fellow members he received 100,000 Servergy shares to find investors for the computer company, which develops secure, cloud-based servers.
The SEC said Mr. Paxton told the group that Servergy was a ""great company"" and even told one member of the investment group that the offering price would double in the next week if he didn't invest.
However, Judge Mazzant decided that the SEC failed to show that Mr. Paxton's relationship with the group's members meant he owed them a duty to disclose his compensation.
""Whether or not someone thinks he should have done that, it does not justify the SEC bringing a case that has no plausible legal basis,"" said Matthew Martens, a partner at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP who represented Mr. Paxton.
Mr. Paxton still faces state criminal charges in Texas related to similar claims. A grand jury in Collin County, north of Dallas, indicted Mr. Paxton in 2015 on charges including two first-degree felonies relating to securities fraud and one third-degree felony related to failing to register as an investment adviser. Mr. Paxton has pleaded not guilty and has said he won't resign, which state Democrats have called for him to do.
'Flash Boys' Exchange IEX Criticizes Nasdaq Order-Type Proposal By Alexander Osipovich
IEX Group Inc. criticized a proposal for a new way to submit stock orders by Nasdaq Inc., saying it would enable ""predatory trading strategies"" that hurt investors.
In November, Nasdaq unveiled a proposal for an ""extended life"" order type, which would encourage the posting of
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 324 of 1177

buy and sell orders on the Nasdaq Stock Market that last at least one second.
In return for a commitment to keep the order live for a second or longer, the order would gain priority over others. Nasdaq's proposed order type has been seen as an alternative to IEX's best-known feature, the ""speed bump,"" a delay imposed to thwart certain predatory high-speed trading strategies.
IEX said in a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission Thursday that the proposal ""raises significant concerns about the potential for information leakage."" The letter was a fresh salvo against incumbent stock exchanges from IEX, made famous by Michael Lewis' 2014 book ""Flash Boys,"" which cast the firm's founders as advocates of investors fed up with rapid-fire trading.
Nasdaq's extended-life order has also come under fire from big electronic trading firms such as Citadel Securities LLC, which said the rejiggering of the exchange's standard queue priority model was unfairly discriminatory to market makers.
According to Nasdaq, the idea is to give retail investors a better chance of getting trades done at a favorable price. The problem for slower-moving investors is that their orders can get stuck in the back of long queues before being executed, and ultrafast electronic trading firms ahead of them in the queues will quickly cancel their orders if they believe the price of a stock is about to move against them.
So by the time the slower investor's order gets executed, the price of the stock is often about to drop, if they have placed a buy order, or rise, if they were trying to sell--the opposite of what the investor would want.
According to IEX, the problem is that the proposal envisions a special flag identifying extended-life orders that would be visible in a detailed market-data feed that Nasdaq sells to its biggest customers.
The presence of that flag would help sophisticated trading firms figure out which orders were coming from retail investors or from big institutional investors, according to IEX.
A Nasdaq spokesman said the company would respond to IEX's criticism through the SEC's comment process.
Foreign Investors Spurn China's Markets
By Shen Hong, Anjie Zheng and Rachel Rosenthal
SHANGHAI--China is opening its financial markets more than ever to global investors, hoping the charm offensive will attract more money just as it struggles to stem heavy capital withdrawals.
The expected gusher of funds hasn't materialized.
In just over 12 months, China has opened its $9 trillion bond market to overseas investors and launched a trading link between the Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock markets that allows foreigners to trade the shares of some of the country's fastest-expanding companies. This week, Chinese regulators allowed overseas investors in its bond market to buy financial products traded domestically that will let them hedge currency risks.
But while foreigners may have long sought to invest in stocks and bonds in China, where annual economic growth is near 7%, as the last great frontier in global markets, they have so far been hesitant.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 325 of 1177

Overseas investors' Chinese bondholdings dropped to 1.3% of the total outstanding by the end of last year, a fall from 1.4% before the market's broad opening in February 2016. Money flowing into Shenzhen stocks from Hong Kong has been tepid, averaging just 5% of the daily 13 billion yuan ($1.89 billion) quota allowed in February. The trend is similar for a trading link between Shanghai and Hong Kong set up in 2014.
Investors cite several worries, including time-consuming registration processes and confusion over the tax rules on capital gains. Some said markets in China are too expensive. Shares on Shenzhen's small-cap ChiNext board trade at 71 times earnings. The yuan's slide in the past year has put off many, even though the slump has paused recently.
Others refer to regular state interventions in markets, such as the heavy share-buying by government-backed funds whenever Chinese stocks dip. Another worry: whether, given China's tight capital controls, investors will be able to get their money out of China as readily as it is being welcomed in.
""There's a risk that at any point the authorities can step in. That risk must be compensated for foreign investors, for example, by a cheaper market,"" said Lukas Daalder, chief investment officer at Robeco Investment Solutions in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.
For China, where monthly capital withdrawals are roughly $30 billion to $60 billion, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts, there is a big potential prize from further opening up its markets.
Stock-index provider MSCI Inc. has kept mainland-listed Chinese stocks out of its key indexes, citing concerns such as restrictions on capital withdrawals. Some $500 billion could in time pour into Chinese shares, about 10% of the market's total value, if they were included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, HSBC Holdings PLC analysts estimated last summer.
Chinese bonds, meanwhile, aren't included in major bond indexes run by banks like J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. and Citigroup Inc. that are commonly tracked by global fund managers, partly because of concerns about issues like market regulation and capital controls. Goldman reckons some $250 billion could eventually flow into Chinese debt markets if the bonds were admitted.
Some investors who have been eager to jump into China said regulators' latest move to give them more ability to hedge risks resolved a big hang-up.
""Now we are ready, we are finalizing"" plans to invest in the onshore market, said Jean-Charles Sambor, deputy head of emerging-market fixed income at BNP Paribas Investment Partners in London, which manages [euro]560 billion ($591 billion). ""Regulatory issues are gradually being clarified; we are much more comfortable.""
Still, few foreign asset managers have created funds dedicated to China's onshore bond market, said Chantal Grinderslev, senior adviser at Z-Ben Advisors, a Shanghai-based strategic consultant, given a lack of demand from investors. Exceptions include U.S.-based hedge fund Bridgewater Associates LP, which has registered seven products to invest in Chinese bonds. A Bridgewater spokesman said the fund is ""looking forward to investing in China and are moving forward to do that."".
""No one wants to be at a cocktail party saying they don't have a China strategy,"" said Ms. Grinderslev. ""But for the majority of firms, it's more lip service than action.""

U.K.-based Standard Life Investments is typical of major investment funds keeping their China powder dry. A big turnoff is Chinese regulators' lack of transparency, said Mark Baker, an emerging-market portfolio manager at the firm in Hong Kong, adding that currently unfavorable market conditions--from rising inflation, which hurts bondholders by eating away at the value of future payments, to a weakening currency--have taken away any urgency to invest in China.
""It doesn't really feel like a slam-dunk trade at the moment,"" said Mr. Baker. ""We're just not there banging the table asking for access on the basis of the investment opportunity alone.""
Wayne Bowers, executive vice president of Northern Trust Asset Management, which manages $942 billion, said another concern is the absence of a level playing field between domestic and foreign firms in the country.
""One of the questions we ask on a regular basis is how I am going to be treated both in terms of liquidity, withholding tax and underlying regulatory oversight,"" said Mr. Bowers.
WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup CFPB's Cordray: Judge Gorsuch 'Very Very Capable'
Neil Gorsuch and Richard Cordray may sit on the opposite ends of the ideological spectrum for top legal officials on the government payroll. But the conservative Supreme Court nominee and the Democratic head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have a strong common element: As young lawyers, they clerked for the same two Supreme Court justices: Byron White and Anthony Kennedy. So when Cordray was asked to comment on Gorsuch, he offered a generous praise. ""I think he is a conscientious, very very capable judge,"" Cordray said in an interview with CNBC. ""Justice White and Justice Kennedy taught me a lot of lessons that I think I carried into my approach to enforcing the law and respecting the law to this day and I am sure at Judge Gorsuch does as well.""

Insider Case Against Gambler Walters Will Proceed
A federal judge on Wednesday declined to dismiss the insider-trading case against legendary gambler William ""Billy"" Walters, rejecting the defense's argument that government leaks about the investigation to the press had unfairly influenced the grand jury. In a 20-page ruling, US District judge said Walters failed to show that he was harmed by any leaks. Lawyers for Walters had moved to dismiss the case in January, after federal prosecutors in Manhattan wrote in court papers that a FBI agent had admitted to sharing secret information about the insider- trading probe with journalists from The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.

China Drags Feet on Consolidating Financial Regulation
China's top leadership is dragging its feet on consolidating financial regulation, as other countries have done in times of heightened risk. Top banking regulator, Guo Shuqing, said that plans to form a ""super-regulator"" were just rumors, at a press conference Thursday morning in Beijing. Some analysts are expecting a merger between China's banking and insurance regulator that would give more power to Guo, who was appointed to his position as chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission just last week. China's central bank has stepped up efforts to streamline regulation of wealth management products, which have been a headache for authorities as issuers and sellers dodge regulatory loopholes. WMPs totaled 29.1 trillion yuan by the end of 2016, up 23.8% from the

Crowdfunding Gets Off to a Slow Start, SEC Data Shows
Equity crowdfunding, a new way of raising small amounts of capital that was authorized by Congress in 2012, is off and running. But judging from how much it has raised so far, crowdfunding isn't going to revolutionize the capital markets anytime soon.
The Securities and Exchange Commission published research Tuesday showing that companies raised about $8.1 million using equity crowdfunding last year. That figure was spread over about 28 deals, meaning the average successful raise was about $290,000. More than 130 offerings didn't report raising any money at all, according to the SEC's figures.

The methodology international regulators use to measure capital held by systemically important financial institutions has ""several shortcomings,"" according to research by Sylvain Benoit,Christophe Hurlin and Christophe Perignon for HEC Paris, a French business school. Using regulatory data for 119 U.S. and international banks, the researchers find that ""the current scoring methodology severely distorts the allocation of regulatory capital among banks"" and say that the current scores are driven too much by factors that are exogenous to the banks, like exchange rates or the actions of other banks.

They suggest that's part of the reason why stock markets have been reaching new highs, anticipating a government ""whose regulations and policies reflect such practical wisdom -- for investors, business owners, health-care consumers and taxpayers,"" according to the editorial.

HSBC,"Inflation Is Back, But Where It Goes from Here Depends on the Region; A major factor in higher global prices has been oil, but that effect is likely to abate by second quarter"," Mar 4, 2017",0,"
Inflation is back around the globe--even in Japan, the poster-child of an economy long beset by falling prices. The big question now is whether it will stick around.
A major factor in higher global prices so far has been oil, which hit a 13-year low in January 2016 and has nearly doubled since. When that is fed into annual inflation rate data, it helps drive up the year-over-year comparisons.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 331 of 1177
But that effect is likely to start to abate by the second quarter, absent another run-up in oil prices this year. At that point, global inflation trends could start to diverge.
In developed markets like the U.S., Europe and Japan, the impact of tightening labor markets will step in to pick up where oil has left off, economists say. In emerging markets, though, inflation may moderate as a result of weak underlying economic growth.
That could lead to differing policy paths for global central banks, ""with less accommodation or even outright tightening needed in developed markets but continued accommodation, if not outright easing, needed to cushion growth in emerging markets"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asia economic research at HSBC Holdings PLC in Hong Kong.
On Friday, Japan reported that core consumer prices, which exclude fresh food but include energy, rose for the first time in more than a year in January, up 0.1% from a year earlier. Petroleum inflation accelerated 9.2% from a year earlier, compared with 0.5% in December, according to Capital Economics.
Eurozone consumer prices rose 2% in February, the highest annual rate of inflation since January 2013, largely due to a 9.2% increase in energy costs, according to Eurostat. In the U.S., a 10.8% rise in energy costs drove annual inflation to 2.5% in January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The trend marks a turnaround from a year ago, when the word ""deflation"" was closer to economists' lips. The specter of falling prices pushed Japan's central bank into new policy experiments, from setting negative interest rates to setting a target rate for 10-year government bonds.
The European Central Bank started buying corporate bonds in June, and the U.S. Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold throughout last year.
In Japan, policy makers are growing confident that the inflation rate will accelerate to more than 1% within a year or so--even as oil prices stabilize--as the country rides the tailwinds of stronger U.S. economy and a weaker yen, according to people close to the central bank. A lower yen would drive up import prices, underpinning higher inflation.
Historically, it has taken nine months for currency weakness to show up in inflation readings, said Shuichi Ohsaki, Japan rates strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Tokyo. He expects the impact of the weakening yen to kick in by April. The yen was last at 114.25 per U.S. dollar.
Bank of Japan officials are also gaining confidence that wages will rise this year. While companies remain cautious about giving base-wage increases to full-time workers, they are seen as more willing to raise their bonuses while increasing hourly wages for part-time or temporary workers, who are in short supply.
In a speech last month, BOJ Deputy Gov. Hiroshi Nakaso pointed to tightening labor market conditions as evidence of Japan's improving ""output gap,"" which measures the difference between an economy's actual and potential output.
This week, the U.S. reported that the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell to the lowest level in nearly half a century. While unemployment is still high in Europe, the figure fell to a seven-year low of 9.6% in December and held steady in January, the latest data available.
Tightening labor markets could lead to ""second-round effects,"" as workers with higher wages spend more and businesses raise prices to cover their costs, giving inflation an extra boost, said HSBC's Mr. Neumann.
In Asia's emerging markets, there are few price pressures beyond fuel. Food prices, which tend to make up a larger share of inflation baskets than energy, have been stable. Moreover, ""relatively subdued economic growth will also help keep inflation in check,"" wrote Capital Economics in a note.
""At this stage, even though we expect growth in Asia to pick up from last year, we don't think the pace is strong enough to create genuine inflation pressures,"" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ Bank in Singapore.
In China, where the consumer-price index rose 2.5% in January from a year earlier--the fastest pace in more than 21?2 years--many economists believe that inflation will moderate this year as the effects of government stimulus fades and Beijing turns its attention to tamping down potential asset bubbles.

HSBC,"Inflation Is Back, But Where It Goes from Here Depends on the Region; A major factor in higher global prices has been oil, but that effect is likely to abate by second quarter"," Mar 5, 2017",1,"Inflation is back around the globe--even in Japan, the poster-child of an economy long beset by falling prices. The big question now is whether it will stick around.
A major factor in higher global prices so far has been oil, which hit a 13-year low in January 2016 and has nearly doubled since. When that is fed into annual inflation rate data, it helps drive up the year-over-year comparisons. But that effect is likely to start to abate by the second quarter, absent another run-up in oil prices this year. At that point, global inflation trends could start to diverge.
In developed markets like the U.S., Europe and Japan, the impact of tightening labor markets will step in to pick up where oil has left off, economists say. In emerging markets, though, inflation may moderate as a result of weak underlying economic growth.
That could lead to differing policy paths for global central banks, ""with less accommodation or even outright tightening needed in developed markets but continued accommodation, if not outright easing, needed to cushion growth in emerging markets"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asia economic research at HSBC Holdings PLC in Hong Kong.

HSBC,Deutsche Bank: Big Capital Call Offers Little Long-Term Reward; The German lender is seeking stability but investors will likely be underwhelmed," Mar 5, 2017",0,"
Deutsche Bank wants another [euro]8 billion ($8.5 billion) from long-suffering investors. The big concern will be that they are throwing more good money after bad since they put in the same amount in 2014.
The bank is promising yet another strategy rethink, reversing several plans put in place in 2015. And while there is the promise of quick, if small, dividends, the headline target of a 10% return on tangible equity in some undated future is underwhelming.
The capital raise has long been expected , but it is coming now with another new strategy. Two big things have happened: Its capital needs have become more clear, and it suffered a
shock loss of revenues last year due to fears over its stability.
On capital, the bank has been waiting with more concern than most for the outcome of global rule changes that threaten to significantly raise its requirements.
These changes are still not fully agreed upon months after they should have been, but one thing is clear: Banks won't have to start implementing them for five years and will have a further five years to meet them. That gives Deutsche Bank a lot of time to adjust whatever the outcome.
Deutsche Bank also has settled most of the costliest regulatory fines that were long hanging over it. But fear over its ability to pay a $14 billion mortgage-related fine initially demanded by the Justice Department was the spark for revenue shock in the final quarter of 2016.
As the bank's shares fell and the cost of insuring its debt against default shot up, it became more expensive for clients to trade with Deutsche Bank. Many took their business elsewhere.
Deutsche Bank's revenues dropped by [euro]3.5 billion last year in a shrinking investment banking market and about [euro]1 billion of that was down to the riskiness of the bank itself rather than simple activity trends.
So Deutsche Bank is seeking more stability. It will now keep Postbank, the domestic retail business it said it would sell at its last strategy plan in October 2015. It will also recombine its global markets business with its investment bank, having only separated them in 2015, and make it more focused on more stable corporate clients.
It also wants to lower the cost for its clients of dealing with Deutsche Bank as a counterparty, for example in derivative contracts. To do that it is bolstering its balance sheet by lifting its target capital ratio above 13% from 12.5% now, which it hasn't yet met and always looked too low. The rights issue should lift it to 14%.
The future Deutsche Bank now looks more like HSBC than Credit Suisse or Goldman Sachs. However much sense that might make, its past strategic missteps and reversals will mean yet another capital raise will be met grudgingly at best.

Prospects for SEC Paralysis--Jay Clayton Edition

As Securities and Exchange Commission chief, Mary Jo White struggled to advance her agenda through the often- fractious commission , due in part to the agency's depleted ranks last year. Notably, the agency's quorum requirements handed Michael Piwowar, the agency's sole Republican, a veto over action he didn't support.
A similar dynamic is shaping up to potentially stymie Jay Clayton, President Donald Trump's pick to head the SEC, albeit in reverse, politically speaking: Kara Stein, the SEC's sole Democrat, will have a veto over Mr. Clayton's agenda.
That's because once Mr. Clayton joins the commission, the agency will be operating with just three members--two fewer than its full complement. The SEC's quorum rules require all three members to be present for the agency to pass a regulation, bring a civil lawsuit or take virtually any other action not delegated to staff.
By simply refusing to show up to a vote, a dissenting Ms. Stein would be able to block the agency from acting altogether.
For Mr. Clayton, this means trouble for his agenda, which is expected to focus on easing what he sees as unnecessary regulations on raising capital. It's unlikely Ms. Stein, an outspoken supporter of tough postcrisis regulation, would support a deregulatory approach.
(The nomination of Mr. Clayton, a political independent, is pending before the Senate Banking Committee, which has yet to schedule a nominations hearing.)
To be sure, the SEC gridlock theoretically lasts only until the Trump administration has time to nominate, and the Senate confirms, individuals to fill the two other vacancies at the agency. It's unclear how long that will take, but the Trump administration is generally behind the ball in filling key regulatory positions compared to its immediate predecessors. That means it could take many months before the SEC is operating at full strength.
The two commissioner vacancies in question have long gone unfilled in part because Senate Democrats couldn't agree in 2015 on who should fill one of the seats, which formerly belonged to Luis Aguilar. The Obama White House's preferred successor, a well-known corporate attorney, was shot down by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and her allies before he could be nominated.
The Obama administration's eventual selection, law professor Lisa Fairfax , had only limited support among Senate Democrats and failed to advance through the chamber in the last Congress. Ms. Fairfax's nomination died along with that of Hester Peirce, a Republican tapped for the second vacancy (to succeed ex-commissioner Daniel Gallagher).
Mr. Trump now has an opportunity to renominate Ms. Peirce, though it is unclear if he will do so. It's also unclear whom the White House will tap to fill Mr. Aguilar's slot, though Mr. Trump could elect to nominate a second Republican or independent to fill Mr. Aguilar's old seat, WSJ Pro Financial Regulation reported last week .

looking pretty good. For the past five years, it has been a totally different game plan, with asset managers playing defense against the federal government, scrambling to deflect a barrage of new regulations and letting a few get into the goal.
But with Republicans now controlling the White House, Congress and the regulatory agencies, sponsors of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are gearing up to fight for new regulations of their own--regulations, they say, that would promote growth and innovation. And they expect the next leader of the Securities and Exchange Commission, breaking from Obama-era worries that funds could be a source of systemic financial risk, to favor these measures.

New Class of Mutual Fund Shares in Limbo as 'Fiduciary' Rule Is Delayed
The delay of a rule that tightens standards on brokerages' retirement-savings advice is disrupting efforts to roll out a new class of mutual-fund shares designed to comply with the regulation.
Work to create these transaction or ""T"" shares has been delayed or suspended while the Labor Department reviews the rule for repeal or revision, according to some brokerage firms familiar with fund managers' efforts surrounding the shares. The new fund shares would feature uniform sales charges across all fund categories to help eliminate any pay incentive that might cause a broker to recommend a higher-cost fund over a less-expensive similar option in potential violation of the Labor Department's ""fiduciary"" rule.

Deutsche Bank to Tap Market for $8.5 Billion
Deutsche Bank AG said Sunday it will seek to raise [euro]8 billion ($8.5 billion) through a share sale, a move aimed at shoring up the German lender's capital less than two years into a major restructuring under Chief Executive John Cryan.
The bank is also reorganizing major businesses for the second time in 18 months, in two cases reversing high- profile strategic decisions from 2015. It is keeping the Postbank retail-banking business in Germany it had sought for two years to sell. And it is recombining its corporate-finance and deal-advisory business with its sprawling trading unit, following a costly move to split them in late 2015.
Trump's Pick for SEC Chairman Clears Ethics Hurdle

One big reason: they are paying out less in penalties for past wrongdoing.
In revenue terms, the picture is more mixed, but one thing is clear: almost all the Europeans are finding it tough to attract business while being stingier with their capital, or taking less risk.

HSBC,"China Foreign-Exchange Reserves Vault Back Above $3 Trillion; PBOC says forex reserves rose by $6.92 billion in February from a month ago, beating economists' forecast of a $28 billion drop"," Mar 7, 2017",1,"BEIJING--China's foreign-exchange reserves rose last month for the first time in eight months due to Beijing's concerted effort to stanch capital outflows as well as valuation changes in the stockpile's assets.
The reserves--the world's largest--increased by $6.92 billion in February to $3.005 trillion, following a drop of $12.31 billion in January, according to data released by the People's Bank of China on Tuesday. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected a $28 billion decrease in February.
The gain lifted the reserves back above the $3 trillion mark, after their fall below that level in January. Economists
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 349 of 1177
attributed the increase to the government's broad-ranging measures to stem the flow of money moving offshore, prop up a yuan weakening against the U.S. dollar and bolster sagging confidence in the economy.
""All outflow channels have been basically closed, so it is not too shocking to me,"" said HSBC economist Ma Xiaoping.
Chinese authorities have stepped up scrutiny of foreign-exchange activities by companies and households. The measures include controls on Chinese companies seeking to invest overseas, restrictions on converting the yuan into foreign currencies and a crackdown on underground banks often used to evade controls to move money offshore.
Also helping the February reserves tally, some assets in the portfolio gained in value, offsetting the depreciation of other major currencies against the U.S. dollar, China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange said in a statement after the data release.
The weakening of the euro and pound against the U.S. dollar last month likely resulted in a negative valuation effect on China's reserves, but February's rebound in major government-bond prices also likely yielded a sizable valuation gain, said economists at UBS Securities Asia. They estimated February's total valuation gain at about $5 billion.
Beijing kept the yuan steady against the U.S. dollar in February, when the yuan rose about 0.1%. UBS economists said that likely helped to ease pressures to send money offshore.
Outflow pressures may pick up soon, as the Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates either in March or June, said HSBC's Ms. Ma. Beijing will unlikely follow the Fed's footsteps to raise benchmark rates, as it still needs to stabilize domestic economic growth, she said.
""Stability is clearly a message policy makers want to send now,"" she said.
Economists have said that authorities are focused on stabilizing economic growth and the yuan exchange rate to ensure a smooth transition ahead of a Communist Party leadership shuffle later this year."
HSBC,"Why Central Banks Are Stockpiling Foreign Reserves; 'External reserves are a form of insurance for sovereigns against crisis and defaults,' says an analyst"," Mar 7, 2017",0,"Central banks around the world are loading up on foreign-currency reserves, highlighting the fragile underpinnings of the global economic recovery despite a more buoyant mood in financial markets.
In emerging economies, reserve levels have stabilized after two years of big declines. Two-thirds of the 30 biggest emerging markets grew their reserves last year, and foreign-currency holdings in Israel, Vietnam and the Czech Republic recently reached all-time highs.
China's foreign reserves also rose by $6.9 billion in February compared with the previous month, rebounding for the first in eight months. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected a $28 billion drop but the gains pushed China's reserve total back above the $3 trillion mark.
Rising reserve balances are often a reassuring sign for investors, because they show individual nations have the capacity to deal with market shocks or economic downturns that hit their currencies. Foreign reserves, which are used to pay for imports and service foreign-currency debt, are especially important for fast-growing but volatile emerging markets.
""External reserves are a form of insurance for sovereigns against crisis and defaults,"" said Chia-Liang Lian, head of emerging-market debt at Western Asset Management.
Even some central banks in Europe, where big spikes in reserves are usually associated with periods of intense global stress, have been padding their coffers . Switzerland's holdings of foreign assets jumped last month at their fastest pace in more than two years, while Denmark has also stepped up its foreign-currency purchases.
But many investors and analysts worry that underlying the reserve buildup are global trade and capital imbalances that could make the world vulnerable to a fresh crisis should they be disrupted by political or economic unrest. Another period of U.S. dollar strength, which some analysts are predicting if the Federal Reserve keeps pushing interest rates higher, is one potential shock. During the global market selloff early last year, a strong dollar and rising dollar-denominated debt levels in the developing world prompted a rout in emerging-market assets.
The rising reserve totals also suggest that bank officials are accumulating dollars because they have concerns about the global economy, despite a bullish investor mood that has lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average to record highs this year as it soared above 21000 .
The pace of economic growth is picking up in the U.S. and Europe, and analysts say that if President Donald Trump pushes through his corporate tax overhaul and deregulation plan the U.S. economy could expand faster.
The increase in emerging-market reserves reflects in part a rally in commodities prices , which rose about 28% last year and comprise a big part of the developing world's exports. Capital inflows, which in emerging markets excluding China were up nearly 60% last year to $192 billion, have also bolstered reserve levels for these countries. Reserve levels for emerging markets peaked at $8 trillion in 2014, according to the International Monetary Fund. Then they fell sharply after central banks churned through about $1 trillion of reserves to support faltering currencies.
But that cash drain stopped last year. Excluding China's holdings, reserves in the 30 biggest emerging markets held steady at $3.9 trillion in 2016, Fitch Ratings estimated.
The overall figure obscures the fact that two-thirds of the countries grew their reserves last year. The broad number was unchanged largely because several governments in the Middle East dipped into foreign-currency holdings to meet budget needs during the oil-price rout.
China had been another major exception before reserves grew again last month. Economists attributed the increase to the government's broad-ranging measures to stem the flow of money moving offshore, prop up a yuan weakening against the U.S. dollar and bolster sagging confidence in the economy.
""All outflow channels have been basically closed, so it is not too shocking to me,"" said HSBC economist Ma Xiaoping.
In much of the rest of the developing world, reserves were already on the rise. They grew substantially in Egypt, Nigeria and Thailand in recent months. In January, Russia added $13 billion to its $390.6 billion in reserves, its largest monthly increase in more than four years.
Many central banks also accumulate foreign reserves when they purchase assets denominated in other currencies,

using freshly created money. They do this to weaken their currencies, protecting exports and giving a boost to inflation. The Czech central bank intervened in January on a massive scale to maintain its currency target against the euro.
The Swiss National Bank said Tuesday its foreign-exchange reserves swelled nearly 25 billion Swiss francs ($24.63 billion) last month to 668 billion francs, the biggest rise since December 2014, the month before the Swiss abandoned a cap on the franc's value. The pile of foreign reserves is greater than Switzerland's entire gross domestic product.
The franc is regarded as one of the world's safest currencies given Switzerland's stable economy and low debt, meaning its value usually increases when investors seek safety instead of returns.
Analysts cited elections in France this spring, in Germany this fall and continued political uncertainty in Italy, the U.S. and U.K. as reasons for the relentless demand for the franc and other safe-haven currencies.
""Such phases of increased political uncertainty are problematic for us because the Swiss franc is considered a safe haven,"" Swiss Central Bank Chairman Thomas Jordan said in a Swiss newspaper interview on March 4. Liyan Qi and Grace Zhu contributed to this article.

HSBC,"China Foreign-Exchange Reserves Vault Back Above $3 Trillion; PBOC says forex reserves rose by $6.92 billion in February from a month ago, beating economists' forecast of a $28 billion drop"," Mar 8, 2017",1,"BEIJING--China's foreign-exchange reserves rose last month for the first time in eight months due to Beijing's concerted effort to stanch capital outflows as well as valuation changes in the stockpile's assets.
The reserves--the world's largest--increased by $6.92 billion in February to $3.005 trillion, following a drop of $12.31 billion in January, according to data released by the People's Bank of China on Tuesday. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected a $28 billion decrease in February.
The gain lifted the reserves back above the $3 trillion mark, after their fall below that level in January. Economists

attributed the increase to the government's broad-ranging measures to stem the flow of money moving offshore, prop up a yuan weakening against the U.S. dollar and bolster sagging confidence in the economy.
""All outflow channels have been basically closed, so it is not too shocking to me,"" said HSBC economist Ma Xiaoping.
Chinese authorities have stepped up scrutiny of foreign-exchange activities by companies and households. The measures include controls on Chinese companies seeking to invest overseas, restrictions on converting the yuan into foreign currencies and a crackdown on underground banks often used to evade controls to move money offshore.
Also helping the February reserves tally, some assets in the portfolio gained in value, offsetting the depreciation of other major currencies against the U.S. dollar, China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange said in a statement after the data release.
The weakening of the euro and pound against the U.S. dollar last month likely resulted in a negative valuation effect on China's reserves, but February's rebound in major government-bond prices also likely yielded a sizable valuation gain, said economists at UBS Securities Asia. They estimated February's total valuation gain at about $5 billion.
Beijing kept the yuan steady against the U.S. dollar in February, when the yuan rose about 0.1%. UBS economists said that likely helped to ease pressures to send money offshore.
Outflow pressures may pick up soon, as the Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates either in March or June, said HSBC's Ms. Ma. Beijing will unlikely follow the Fed's footsteps to raise benchmark rates, as it still needs to stabilize domestic economic growth, she said.
""Stability is clearly a message policy makers want to send now,"" she said.
Economists have said that authorities are focused on stabilizing economic growth and the yuan exchange rate to ensure a smooth transition ahead of a Communist Party leadership shuffle later this year.

HSBC,"Central Banks Ratchet Up Foreign-Currency Reserves; 'External reserves are a form of insurance for sovereigns against crisis and defaults,' says an analyst"," Mar 8, 2017",1,"Corrections &Amplifications The change in Israel's foreign-currency reserves is shown with a blue line in a chart accompanying this article. An earlier version of the chart incorrectly labeled Israel's data as light green in the legend. (March 15, 2017)
Central banks around the world are increasing foreign-currency reserves, highlighting the fragile underpinnings of the global economic recovery despite a bullish mood in financial markets.
In emerging economies, reserve levels have stabilized after two years of big declines. Two-thirds of the 30 biggest emerging markets increased reserves last year, according to Fitch Ratings. Foreign-currency holdings in Israel, Vietnam and the Czech Republic recently reached new records, their central banks have reported.
China's foreign reserves rose by $6.9 billion in February compared with the previous month, rebounding for the first time in eight months and pushing the reserve total back above the $3 trillion mark.
Some central banks in Europe also have been padding their coffers . Switzerland's holdings of foreign assets jumped last month at their fastest pace in more than two years, while Denmark has also stepped up its foreign- currency purchases.
There are likely several reasons for the concurrent increases.
Reserves rise when central banks buy foreign currencies to keep their own currencies from appreciating too fast, which can hurt their exporters and undermine economic growth.
In Europe, big increases in reserves are often associated with periods of intense global stress. Some analysts suggested that elections this year in France and Germany, as well as political uncertainty in the U.S. and U.K., may be prompting investors to seek safety in currencies like the Swiss franc, putting upward pressure on the currency. That has led the Swiss central bank to buy foreign currencies to keep the franc from strengthening too much. Emerging-market countries also stockpile reserves in an effort to fortify their markets and economies against sudden shocks that could cause foreigners to pull out money.
""External reserves are a form of insurance for sovereigns against crisis and defaults,"" said Chia-Liang Lian, head of emerging-market debt at Western Asset Management.
Rising reserve balances can be a reassuring sign for investors, because they show individual nations have some capacity to deal with market shocks or economic downturns. The value of many nations' reserves has risen recently as the U.S. dollar has declined.
But many investors and analysts worry that underlying the reserve buildup are global trade and capital imbalances that could make the world vulnerable to a fresh crisis should the flow of capital be disrupted by political or economic unrest.
Another period of U.S. dollar strength, which some analysts are predicting if the Federal Reserve keeps pushing interest rates higher, is one potential shock. During the global market selloff early last year, a strong dollar and rising dollar-denominated debt levels in the developing world prompted a rout in emerging-market assets.
The rising reserve totals also suggest that bank officials are accumulating dollars because they have concerns about the global economy, despite a rally that has lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average to records this year as it soared above 21000 .
The pace of economic growth is picking up in the U.S. and Europe, and analysts said that if President Donald Trump pushes through his corporate tax overhaul and deregulation plan, the U.S. economy could expand faster. That could lead the Fed to raise interest rates more aggressively, triggering a reversal of capital flows from emerging markets back to the U.S.
The increase in emerging-market reserves reflects in part a rally in commodities prices , which rose about 28% last year, according to the S&P GSCI Index, and comprise a big part of the developing world's exports. Capital inflows, which in emerging markets, excluding China, were up nearly 60% last year to $192 billion, have also bolstered

reserve levels for these countries.
Globally, total reserves rose in last year's third quarter to $11.01 trillion, up from $10.97 trillion a quarter earlier, according to the latest data available from the International Monetary Fund. The level was below the peak of $12 trillion in mid-2014.
Reserve levels for emerging markets peaked at $8 trillion in 2014, according to the IMF. Then they fell sharply after central banks churned through about $1 trillion of reserves to support faltering currencies, a process by which they buy their currency using U.S. dollars or other major currencies.
But that cash drain stopped last year. Excluding China's holdings, reserves in the 30 biggest emerging markets held steady at $3.9 trillion in 2016, Fitch Ratings estimated.
Despite the fact that two-thirds of the countries increased reserves, the broad number was unchanged largely because several governments in the Middle East dipped into foreign-currency holdings to meet budget needs during the oil-price rout.
China had been another major exception before reserves rose again last month. Economists attributed the increase to the government's broad measures to stem the flow of money moving out of the country, prop up a yuan weakening against the U.S. dollar and bolster sagging confidence in the economy.
China's reserves fell by $320 billion last year, according to the Institute of International Finance. Some analysts said the return to reserve growth last month could signal a notable shift after the central bank burned through $1 trillion in foreign currency over the past few years.
""All outflow channels have been basically closed, so it is not too shocking to me,"" said HSBC Holdings PLC economist Ma Xiaoping.
In much of the rest of the developing world, reserves were already on the rise. They increased substantially in Egypt, Nigeria and Thailand in recent months. In January, Russia added $13 billion to its $390.6 billion in reserves, its largest monthly increase in more than four years.
Many central banks also accumulate foreign reserves when they purchase assets denominated in dollars and other hard currencies. They do this to slow down the appreciation of their currencies, protecting exports and giving a boost to inflation. The Czech central bank intervened in January on a large scale to maintain its currency target against the euro.
The Swiss National Bank said Tuesday that its foreign-exchange reserves swelled nearly 25 billion Swiss francs ($24.7 billion) last month to 668 billion francs, the biggest rise since December 2014, the month before the Swiss abandoned a cap on the franc's value against the euro.

HSBC,"U.K.'s Iranian-Owned Banks, Freed of Sanctions, Now Face Trust Barriers; Big banks are unwilling to deal with the Iranian entities"," Mar 8, 2017",1,"Just after the European Union lifted sanctions on several of Iran's biggest banks last year, Bank Sepah International PLC creaked back to life.
The Iranian-owned, British-licensed bank, located on a prime street in London's financial district, was all but mothballed for nearly a decade due to sanctions designed to force Iran to abandon its nuclear program. Then in 2015, Iran reached a landmark agreement on the program with the U.S. and other world powers, paving the way for Iranian banks to reconnect to the global financial system. Bank Sepah, which once processed more than 2,000 transactions a month and had a $1.5 billion balance sheet, was eager to get back to business.
Yet, more than a year after the nuclear deal, Bank Sepah still hasn't processed a single commercial transaction, other than paying 28 employees and some vendors, because it is still effectively frozen out of the financial system, especially in the U.K., by big banks unwilling to risk dealing with Iranian entities.
""They've all just said it's not in their risk appetite at this current time,"" said Gary Bishop, chief operating officer of the bank who joined last April to help bring it up to speed.
Those problems are expected to worsen under President Donald Trump, whose administration has taken an antagonistic position against Iran , including the nuclear deal. The predicament of Bank Sepah, and other Iranian banks, shows the lasting impacts of sanctions on foreign financial institutions and how uncertain political environments can create a kind of extended limbo for companies and banks coming off barred lists.
""On paper, there may be banks removed from sanctions, but the geopolitical environment suggests this is not a done deal,"" said Juan Zarate, a former Treasury Department official who now advises U.S. and U.K. banks and other institutions on financial crime and sanctions issues. ""Western institutions feel it is very risky.""
The U.S. still maintains sanctions on dozens of Iranian financial institutions, companies and individuals believed to be connected to the country's nuclear program and its Revolutionary Guard, the elite Iranian military unit that reports directly to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. But the U.S. State Department encouraged non- American banks to fill the gap and help Iran reintegrate into the system. John Kerry, while still Secretary of State, traveled to London last year to push the issue directly with bankers. The entreaties have been rejected.
One risk big the U.K. banks have cited in public documents is that Iranian banks aren't up to the same anti-money- laundering and financial fraud standards. In recent years, some of those banks paid billions of dollars in fines to U.S. authorities for sanctions and money-laundering violations involving Iran.
  PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 360 of 1177
Bank Sepah's situation is similar to several other Iranian-owned banks in the U.K., including Persia International Bank PLC and Melli Bank PLC., most of which specialize in trade finance to facilitate imports and exports to Iran from abroad They are technically free to do business but unable to actually do so because big U.K. banks refuse to process their transactions.
The problems are worse for banks owned by the Iranian government, but private banks are still unable to do business with big European banks, said Parviz Aghili, the managing director of Middle East Bank.
That could affect trade because the smaller European banks willing to do business with Iranian bank don't have space on their balance sheets to finance big trade deals.
""What I'm concerned about is bigger transactions, in the case of Boeing, in the case of for instance Airbus,"" he said, citing recent jet deals worth tens of billions of dollars. ""Unless the manufacturers assist it would be very difficult, because the smaller banks are really not in a position to handle the kind of requirements Iran has.""
Sitting in Bank Sepah's office, where a 1970s-era de?cor is accented with Persian carpets in the hallways and a picture of Mr. Khamenei in the entryway, Mr. Bishop described a quandary for the Iranian-owned banks in Britain: Their parent banks have succeeded in restarting financial transactions through branches in Europe and Asia, but they can't use the traditional payment systems in the U.K. because larger banks like HSBC Holdings PLC and Citigroup Inc. have refused to clear the Iranian-owned bank transactions.
Those banks declined to comment.
Another potential option for Bank Sepah was to use an account at the Bank of England to gain access to the U.K. payment system. But the bank couldn't open an account without opening a reserve account where they would deposit funds in the form of British government bonds, and no big bank would help them obtain them, Mr. Bishop said.
The only European institution that agreed to let the Bank Sepah clear transactions is the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank. So far, Bank Sepah hasn't made any commercial transactions through the arrangement.
""They're in an invidious position because they are a U.K. regulated and authorized bank, but they can only access the European clearing system through Germany,"" said Sue Millar, Bank Sepah's attorney in London with the firm Stephenson Harwood.
Bank Sepah has tried to respond to concerns about the Iranian banks' financial fraud standards. It agreed last year to license a software package from Swift, the global payment intermediary, to screen staff communications for key risk words and political names. The deal, however, has been delayed because Swift realized a portion of the program was American and required it to obtain a license from the U.S. government. Swift declined to comment. ""It's almost like there is a will out there to stop Iran gaining access to what was promised,"" Mr. Bishop said. The situation is not too different from during the sanctions period, where Bank Sepah staff were hung up on if they tried to call another bank.
The Iranian-owned British banks are now considering filing an arbitration case with the Payment Systems Regulator in the U.K. to force banks to do business with them.
""We will assess any applications we receive under these powers in line with guidance we have published,"" said a spokesman for the agency.
To make big banks more comfortable, the top three Iranian-owned British banks have joined forces to create their own ""Radar List"" of companies in Iran they won't do business with because of potential ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard. U.S. officials have estimated the group controls as much as half of Iran's economy through holdings in property, oil and gas, and telecommunications.
""We know we have to be whiter than white and cleaner than clean,"" Mr. Bishop said. ""We recognize the eyes of the regulators will be on us.""

HSBC,"Google, a Cloud-Computing Upstart, Seeks Credibility; Search giant faces an uphill battle against incumbents Amazon and Microsoft"," Mar 8, 2017",1,"
Google conquered internet search. It is having a tougher time winning the rapidly growing cloud-computing industry.
Google is pitching potential corporate customers on its vast network of computers and artificial-intelligence tools, and often undercutting the prices of the two incumbents that dwarf it, cloud-computing pioneer Amazon.com Inc. and corporate-tech veteran Microsoft Corp.
But to catch those rivals, analysts say Google must build more credibility among corporations wary of running their businesses on the servers of an internet-search company with little experience supporting the technology needs of big companies, other than its own.
In response, Google has been expanding its sales, marketing and customer-support staff in an effort to cater to traditional industries.
But Google Cloud chief Diane Greene says the company's technology, and not its business fundamentals, will help it succeed. ""The business-side stuff is not rocket science. It is blocking and tackling,"" she said. ""The part that is rocket science, that's the part I like coming to the party with.""
Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., touted its progress at its cloud conference in San Francisco on Wednesday and announced new customers, including global bank HSBC Holdings PLC. HSBC, which also uses Amazon's and Microsoft's cloud services, said it is using Google's technology to improve its money-laundering detection, run simulations and make complex calculations.
The shift to cloud computing threatens to displace billions of dollars of technology spending as companies from corporate giants to hot startups store their data and run their digital businesses on other companies' computer servers.
Google faces an uphill battle against Amazon and Microsoft. The industry juggernaut, Amazon Web Services, earned $12.22 billion in cloud revenues last year, while Deutsche Bank estimates $2.42 billion for Microsoft's Azure cloud service and $900 million for Google. Those numbers don't include sales of cloud-based productivity tools,
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 363 of 1177
such as Microsoft's Office 365 and Google's Gmail and Google Docs.
While both Microsoft and Google are expected to more than double their cloud sales over the next two years, Microsoft will grow faster than Google, despite its bigger size, Deutsche Bank forecasts.
Ms. Greene said Google is gaining traction, winning most of the time when competing with Amazon or Microsoft for new companies moving to the cloud.
Amazon and Microsoft rebuff that suggestion. ""We rarely see (Google) among the last two finalists for big deals-- especially when it comes to larger customers or enterprises,"" said Ariel Kelman, vice president of marketing for AWS.
Google is only included in about one in 20 of Microsoft's sales engagements, said Judson Althoff, Microsoft's executive vice president of world-wide commercial business . ""And when they do, most customers chose Microsoft.""
Google says the race is far from over. It believes its cloud business could one day eclipse its massive advertising business, which accounted for 88% of Alphabet's $90 billion in sales last year. ""It is so early,"" Ms. Greene said. ""Ninety-five percent of the world's data is not in the cloud.""
Indeed, analysts and cloud executives, including Ms. Greene, predict the cloud and related corporate-tech spending could one day be a $1 trillion market.
Google hired Ms. Greene, a co-founder of enterprise-tech firm VMware Inc., in late 2015 to show it is serious about the cloud. The company's cloud business had been geared toward app developers and tech firms, and some of its biggest clients are still Snap Inc. and Spotify AB.
Amazon and Microsoft boast deep relationships with large corporate customers, as well as vast ecosystems of partners that sell and support their technology. Google needs to convince corporate customers, app developers and cloud consultants that it will develop a similar foundation for its cloud business, said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group LLC, a venture firm that invests in cloud startups.
Mr. McIlwain believes Google trails its rivals in that area, in part because it hasn't built the same sort of longstanding relationships with major consulting firms required to land large corporate customers.
Google is now bolstering its services for traditional companies by hiring workers specialized in industries such as health care, finance and retail, to help make Google's cloud products work for those sectors. Google said it added more cloud employees than any other division last year, and is in the process of hiring 1,000 employees focused on cloud customers.
Google is also adding partnerships with enterprise-software firms that have strong toeholds with big corporations so their software works on Google Cloud, such as SAP SE, which announced its compatibility Wednesday. SAP already works with Amazon's and Microsoft's cloud offerings.
Ms. Greene said now that Google can handle big companies' needs, it aims to win customers with its artificial- intelligence and data-analytics tools.
Analysts say Google's AI tools are top-of-class. For instance, Airbus SE's satellite-imaging group uses Google's image-recognition tool to spot and remove clouds from its satellite images. Ocado Group PLC, a British online- grocery company, uses Google's voice-recognition and language-processing tools to let software monitor its customer-service calls to measure customer sentiment. On Wednesday, Google unveiled a new artificial- intelligence tool for companies to make videos searchable based on their content.
But analysts also say competing on product isn't enough. ""They win quite often when they get invited to the party, but they're not invited to the party enough,"" said Dave Bartoletti, principal analyst at Forrester Research.

HSBC,HSBC To Name AIA CEO Mark Tucker as Chairman; Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver plans to announce he will leave the bank in 2018," Mar 12, 2017",0,"
Corrections &Amplifications
HSBC Holdings PLC is set to name AIA Group Ltd. Chief Executive Mark Tucker as its next chairman, the first time the bank has hired from outside for the role in its 152-year history. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the age of the company. Also, the photo caption incorrectly spelled the name of Mark Tucker. (March 12) LONDON--HSBC Holdings PLC is set to name AIA Group Ltd. Chief Executive Mark Tucker as its next chairman, the first time the bank has hired from outside for the role in its 152-year history.
Mr. Tucker will join the bank in the fall, people familiar with the matter said Sunday, succeeding outgoing HSBC veteran Douglas Flint. Mr. Tucker, currently based in Hong Kong, will relocate to London.
Mr. Flint's planned departure is the first step in refreshing the bank's leadership and setting out its next set of goals. HSBC Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver, who has said he would leave once Mr. Flint's successor is in place, is to announce he will leave the bank in 2018, a person familiar with the matter said Sunday.
That announcement, and formal word of Mr. Tucker's joining, is expected to come after AIA confirms Mr. Tucker's departure in an announcement early Monday in Hong Kong.
Mr. Tucker has been at AIA since 2010. He joined the insurer as its former owner, American International Group Inc., readied it for an initial public offering in Hong Kong. Before AIA, Mr. Tucker was chief executive of Prudential PLC, building its Asian franchise in the 1990s, and has been a nonexecutive director at the Bank of England.
Along with resigning from AIA, Mr. Tucker will also step down from the board of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the people familiar with the matter said.
Mr. Flint, alongside Mr. Gulliver, helped HSBC reshape itself and adapt to harsher regulation and lower profitability for banks after the financial crisis. Their five-year strategy plan in 2011 saw the bank rein in its sprawling global operations, closing dozens of business and exiting from much of Latin America.
After HSBC paid $1.9 billion in a 2012 settlement over money-laundering lapses, Mr. Flint and Mr. Gulliver oversaw a costly effort to raise financial crime-fighting standards at the bank, which is still subject to a deferred- prosecution agreement that was part of the settlement.
The two men were seen by analysts and investors as a formidable duo, with Mr. Flint becoming a top voice in bank regulation circles, and Mr. Gulliver credited with managing the bank's risks with the eye of the trader he once was. But some investors had urged the bank not to let Mr. Flint and Mr. Gulliver linger too long, and last year they
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 366 of 1177
clarified their plans to leave.
Mr. Flint became chairman in December 2010 and has been on HSBC's board since 1995, the year he joined the bank as finance director. Mr. Gulliver, at the bank since 1980, became CEO at the start of 2011.
Since starting in Hong Kong in 1865, HSBC has always selected insiders as chairman, even when it meant falling afoul of U.K. corporate-governance recommendations. It had said that this time around it would bring in an outsider.

HSBC,"Markets Defy Global Political Storms; Volatility levels in stocks, bonds and currencies have eased and big investors are avoiding major calls"," Mar 12, 2017",0,"If the world seems particularly unpredictable these days, no one appears to have told investors.
From the uncertainties around President Donald Trump's policies to the sudden belief the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this month , there are plenty of unsettling factors in the U.S. Other reasons to fret include France's close presidential election and heightened instability around North Korea.
Yet none of this is roiling financial markets. The level of volatility in global stocks, bonds and currencies--evidenced by the prices for key derivatives known as options--is close to catatonic.
Among the reasons: Subdued market swings in recent weeks are feeding into expectations things will continue this way. Big investors are steering clear of major calls on the market's direction. And despite the disquiet about politics, global economic growth has been steady.
There remains a ""lack of conviction"" among major institutional investors such as hedge funds, according to Rakesh Patel, head of equities for Asia Pacific at HSBC in Hong Kong. In turn, their demand for products such as options is mixed, as investors tend to buy these when they have a strong view about the market's direction or want to protect themselves against worst-case scenarios.
""There is an oversupply of volatility in the market,"" he said. ""The ecosystem of volatility markets, whereby volatility is recycled from wealthy clients to banks and on to institutional investors, has broken down a bit.""
Investors pay close attention to volatility, the amount an asset swings over a given period. Choppy stocks or bonds
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 368 of 1177
can be a turnoff for those who prefer steady returns, but can present the brave with more opportunities for profit. Most investors look at both realized volatility, a measure of an asset's recent swings, and implied volatility, which gauges expectations of future gyrations. The latter is derived from the price of options--popular hedging instruments that give investors the choice to buy or sell assets at a certain price by a future date. The two measures are linked. If investors feel markets are relatively calm, they tend to be less willing to shell out for options, which depresses implied volatility.
Despite the surge in some markets since the American election in November, notably U.S. stocks , day-to-day moves have been subdued. The S&P 500 posted no daily 1% swings in the first two months of the year, compared with three in November and December.
The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, which reflects investors' expectations for moves in the S&P 500 over the next 30 days, has fallen this year, hitting 11.66 on Friday--well below its 10-year average of 21. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch MOVE index, which measures expectations for swings in Treasurys, has also declined in 2017. Emerging-market stocks have been calm too. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF posted seven swings of 1% or more in January and February, compared with 16 such moves in the last two months of 2016.
The CBOE Emerging Markets ETF Volatility Index in turn dropped to 15.23 last month, its lowest level since 2014. The index, which measures expectations for swings in the ETF, has since ticked higher, ending at 17.07 on Friday, but remains below its average of 24.5 based on data going back to March 2011.
Currency volatility has faded too, given the pause in the dollar's postelection rally late last year. J.P. Morgan's gauge of emerging-market currency volatility fell to 9.26 on Tuesday, its lowest level since 2015 and below its 10- year average of 10.9. The index measures expectations for swings in currencies such as the Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Chinese yuan over three months.
The reluctance of influential investors to make major market bets, a factor in the volatility slump, is driven in part because many have already lost money this year as the postelection run-up in the dollar and Treasury yields cooled.
Market participants say investors are unwilling to wager on political uncertainties, such as the timing and extent of Mr. Trump's economic plans or upcoming elections in the Netherlands and France.
""At a time when the Fed is hiking interest rates and we've just had a massive reshape of U.S. politics, volatility does seem remarkably low,"" said Mirza Baig, head of foreign exchange and interest-rate strategy in Asia at BNP Paribas.

HSBC,HSBC Says AIA CEO Mark Tucker Will Be Next Chairman; New chairman will lead effort to find successor to CEO Stuart Gulliver," Mar 13, 2017",1,"Corrections &Amplifications
HSBC Holdings PLC is set to name AIA Group Ltd. Chief Executive Mark Tucker as its next chairman, the first time the bank has hired from outside for the role in its 152-year history. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the age of the company. Also, the photo caption incorrectly spelled the name of Mark Tucker. (March 12) HSBC Holdings PLC named AIA Group Ltd. Chief Executive Mark Tucker as its next chairman--the first time the bank has hired an outsider for the role in its 152-year history.
Mr. Tucker will become chairman on Oct. 1, a month after joining as a board member, HSBC said in a statement Sunday. He will succeed outgoing HSBC veteran Douglas Flint, who has been in the job since late 2010.
Mr. Tucker, who is currently based in Hong Kong, will relocate to London. He will also resign from the board of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he was a nonexecutive director.
The appointment marks a cultural shift for HSBC, after more than a century of promoting insiders to the chairman job, usually after having spent their entire career at the bank.
Mr. Tucker's first job will be to hire a new chief executive: CEO Stuart Gulliver will retire in 2018, the bank said Sunday, as expected.
In a seven-year career at Asian insurer AIA, Mr. Tucker took the company through its separation from former owner, American International Group Inc., in a 2010 initial public offering that repaid the U.S. government for AIG's financial crisis bailout. Mr. Tucker, 59, won accolades and AIA's share price zipped up as the insurer cut costs and expanded its range of products to boost profits. Shares of AIA have more than doubled since the IPO.
Before AIA, Mr. Tucker was chief executive of Prudential PLC, invigorating the staid insurer by building its Asian franchise in the 1990s. Between 2009 and 2012, he was a nonexecutive director at the Bank of England.
Mr. Tucker is known as a smart and measured hand, but with the dynamism to have taken risks in making acquisitions and moving the insurer into higher-margin protection policies in China and elsewhere.
Mr. Tucker will be replaced by Ng Keng Hooi, AIA's regional chief executive, the insurer said Monday.

A marquee hire for the bank, HSBC said Mr. Tucker will receive annual compensation of £1.5 million ($1.8 million), plus benefits and a relocation allowance of £300,000.
Mr. Flint's base salary was also £1.5 million.
Alongside Mr. Gulliver, Mr. Flint helped HSBC reshape itself and adapt to harsher regulation and lower profitability for banks after the financial crisis. Their five-year strategy plan in 2011 saw the bank rein in its sprawling global operations by closing dozens of businesses and exiting much of Latin America. They also dismantled an outdated structure that gave country managers almost unfettered control, and installed global business heads.
After HSBC paid $1.9 billion in a 2012 settlement over money-laundering lapses, Mr. Flint and Mr. Gulliver oversaw a costly effort to raise financial crime-fighting standards at the bank, which is still subject to a deferred- prosecution agreement that was part of the settlement. Both men are likely to have left the bank before the agreement lifts, in mid-2018 at the soonest.
Mr. Flint and Mr. Gulliver were seen by analysts and investors as a formidable duo, with Mr. Flint becoming a top voice in bank regulation circles and Mr. Gulliver credited with managing the bank's risks with the eyes of the trader he once was. However, some investors urged the bank not to let Mr. Flint and Mr. Gulliver linger too long and in 2016 they clarified their plans to leave.
Mr. Flint became chairman in December 2010 and has been on HSBC's board since 1995, the year he joined the bank as finance director. During his tenure, he signed off on acquisitions that would haunt the bank later, including in the U.S., where the bank lost billions from acquiring subprime lender Household International Inc. in 2003, and in Mexico, where the bank admitted in its 2012 settlement admitted to having allowed drug-trafficking proceeds to flow into the U.S. from its bank there.
Mr. Gulliver has been at the bank since 1980 and became CEO at the start of 2011. He survived questions around accountability, when HSBC was found to have helped clients of its Swiss private bank avoid taxes in the 2000s. HSBC apologized in 2015 for what it called historical events and paid $43 million in compensation to authorities in Geneva for organizational failings.
After a messy succession process in 2010, when then-CEO Michael Geoghegan was spurned and Mr. Flint was elevated from chief financial officer to the chairman job, HSBC said it would hire an external chairman next time around. The bank had been under pressure for years to look outside for the role, as its decades-long practice knocked up against U.K. corporate governance reforms that frown on executives becoming chairman.

* Demanding and Direct: HSBC's New Chairman Mark Tucker
* Analysis: History-Making New Chairman Is a Wise Choice

HSBC,"Markets Defy Global Political Storms; Volatility levels in stocks, bonds and currencies have eased and big investors are avoiding major calls"," Mar 13, 2017",1,"If the world seems particularly unpredictable these days, no one appears to have told investors.
From the uncertainties around President Donald Trump's policies to the sudden belief the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this month , there are plenty of unsettling factors in the U.S. Other reasons to fret include France's close presidential election and heightened instability around North Korea.
Yet none of this is roiling financial markets. The level of volatility in global stocks, bonds and currencies--evidenced by the prices for key derivatives known as options--is close to catatonic.
Among the reasons: Subdued market swings in recent weeks are feeding into expectations things will continue this way. Big investors are steering clear of major calls on the market's direction. And despite the disquiet about politics, global economic growth has been steady.
There remains a ""lack of conviction"" among major institutional investors such as hedge funds, according to Rakesh Patel, head of equities for Asia Pacific at HSBC in Hong Kong. In turn, their demand for products such as options is mixed, as investors tend to buy these when they have a strong view about the market's direction or want to protect themselves against worst-case scenarios.
""There is an oversupply of volatility in the market,"" he said. ""The ecosystem of volatility markets, whereby volatility is recycled from wealthy clients to banks and on to institutional investors, has broken down a bit.""
Investors pay close attention to volatility, the amount an asset swings over a given period. Choppy stocks or bonds can be a turnoff for those who prefer steady returns, but can present the brave with more opportunities for profit. Most investors look at both realized volatility, a measure of an asset's recent swings, and implied volatility, which gauges expectations of future gyrations. The latter is derived from the price of options--popular hedging instruments that give investors the choice to buy or sell assets at a certain price by a future date. The two measures are linked. If investors feel markets are relatively calm, they tend to be less willing to shell out for options, which depresses implied volatility.
Despite the surge in some markets since the American election in November, notably U.S. stocks , day-to-day moves have been subdued. The S&P 500 posted no daily 1% swings in the first two months of the year, compared with three in November and December.
The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, which reflects investors' expectations for moves in the S&P 500 over the next 30 days, has fallen this year, hitting 11.66 on Friday--well below its 10-year average of 21. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch MOVE index, which measures expectations for swings in Treasurys, has also declined in 2017. Emerging-market stocks have been calm too. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF posted seven swings of 1% or more in January and February, compared with 16 such moves in the last two months of 2016.
The CBOE Emerging Markets ETF Volatility Index in turn dropped to 15.23 last month, its lowest level since 2014. The index, which measures expectations for swings in the ETF, has since ticked higher, ending at 17.07 on Friday, but remains below its average of 24.5 based on data going back to March 2011.
Currency volatility has faded too, given the pause in the dollar's postelection rally late last year. J.P. Morgan's gauge of emerging-market currency volatility fell to 9.26 on Tuesday, its lowest level since 2015 and below its 10-
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 374 of 1177
year average of 10.9. The index measures expectations for swings in currencies such as the Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Chinese yuan over three months.
The reluctance of influential investors to make major market bets, a factor in the volatility slump, is driven in part because many have already lost money this year as the postelection run-up in the dollar and Treasury yields cooled.
Market participants say investors are unwilling to wager on political uncertainties, such as the timing and extent of Mr. Trump's economic plans or upcoming elections in the Netherlands and France.
""At a time when the Fed is hiking interest rates and we've just had a massive reshape of U.S. politics, volatility does seem remarkably low,"" said Mirza Baig, head of foreign exchange and interest-rate strategy in Asia at BNP Paribas.
One explanation is that economic growth in the U.S., Europe and China has been decent, Mr. Baig said. The broad outlook is more settled than this time a year ago, when fears about China's economy stoked the last extended period of high volatility in global markets.
To be sure, cheap options prices could begin to attract some investors. James Kwok, head of currency management for Amundi Asset Management in London, said he owns some euro put options, which rise in value if the euro declines, in preparation for the French election. One of the leading candidates, Marine Le Pen, has said she wants to pull France out of the European single currency .

HSBC,Dow Drops as Investors Await Cues From Fed; The Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan are set to make interest-rate decisions this week," Mar 13, 2017",0,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average and U.S. government-bond prices slipped Monday as investors prepared for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates later this week.
The Fed is widely expected to raise borrowing costs Wednesday for the first time this year, with federal-funds futures tracked by CME Group pointing to a roughly 95% chance of a rate rise. That has helped push bond yields higher as stocks have continued to climb on the back of a strengthening economy and hopes for improved corporate earnings.
""It's the calm before the storm,"" said David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Global Asset Management. ""The market is still coalesced around three tightenings this year, but there's certainly room for four.""
Expectations that the Fed would boost short-term rates lifted the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note to 2.609%--the highest close since September 2014--from 2.582% Friday. Yields move inversely to prices.
The Dow industrials fell 21.50 points, or 0.1%, to 20881.48 amid relatively light trading activity. The S&P 500 inched up 0.87 point, or less than 0.1%, to 2373.47, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 14.06 points, or 0.2%, to 5875.78. Keeping risk sentiment subdued, U.S. crude-oil futures for April delivery fell 0.2%, to $48.40 a barrel, after losing 9% of their value last week. Prices have been dragged down by concerns that growth in U.S. oil production could foil OPEC's plan to shift the market into a shortage.
Health care was the worst-performing sector of the S&P 500 Monday, shedding 0.2% as investors awaited a Congressional Budget Office analysis of a Republican bill to replace Obamacare that was released after the market closed.
Merck &Co. fell 98 cents, or 1.5%, to $64.15, among the biggest declines in the Dow industrials.
Intel shares dropped 75 cents, or 2.1%, to 35.16 after the chip maker struck a $15.3 billion deal to buy Mobileye, which makes technology for self-driving cars. Shares of Mobileye soared 13.35, or 28%, to 60.62.
The Stoxx Europe 600 advanced 0.4% as a pickup in metals prices boosted the mining sector.
Earlier Monday, shares in Asia mostly ended higher, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gaining 1.1%.
Shares of HSBC Holdings climbed 0.8% in London after the global bank said it was choosing an outsider as chairman for the first time. AIA Group Chief Executive Mark Tucker is set to become chairman on Oct. 1.
In addition to the Fed, the Bank of Japan, Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank are all set to hold meetings this week.
Investors are also watching as Dutch voters head to the polls this week in the first of a series of key elections in the eurozone this year. The performance of Geert Wilders' antiestablishment party is seen as a bellwether for the chances of other populist candidates, including France's Marine Le Pen, a foe of the euro who is seeking the French presidency.

HSBC,HSBC's History-Making New Chairman Is a Wise Choice; Bringing in an outsider should help the banking giant to focus on growth," Mar 13, 2017",1,"
Appointing a new chairman is usually a big moment for a bank: Breaking with over 150 years of tradition in the process adds to the magnitude. So for HSBC Holdings, the appointment of Mark Tucker --the first ever bank outsider to hold the role and an insurance industry veteran to boot--is a major change.
HSBC, one of the world's largest banks that has struggled to grow after a so-called ""lost decade"", looks to have chosen well. Mr. Tucker has plenty of experience in Asia, the region that dominates HSBC's earnings. As chief executive since 2010 of AIA, the insurance company spun out of AIG after the financial crisis, and before that as boss of Asia-focused Prudential PLC, Mr. Tucker has come to know the region's complexities. AIA, for example, has managed
to successfully expand its business in China despite a crackdown on the insurance industry there.
Of more interest to HSBC shareholders may be Mr. Tucker's focus on growth at AIA . He took on accretive acquisitions, expanded the company's banking partnerships and ventured into new markets. The value of AIA's new insurance business has quadrupled on Mr. Tucker's watch, along with a doubling of its operating profits and a threefold increase in its dividends per share. Mr. Tucker's prior experience at Prudential, divesting underperforming businesses and warding off a hostile takeover are also noteworthy.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 380 of 1177
With his experience across different jurisdictions in Asia, Mr. Tucker could help make capital allocation more efficient at HSBC as it implements its next three-year strategic plan, starting from 2018. That's important for a bank which still has a significant portion of its capital in businesses and geographies that don't earn an adequate return on equity, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. He will also lead the search for current CEO Stuart Gulliver's replacement next year, when he is expected to step down.
A nagging question is whether an insurance executive can make it at a big bank with $2.4 trillion in assets, given all the regulatory burdens banks now face. Mr. Tucker's roles as a nonexecutive director at Goldman Sachs and on the Court of the Bank of England's financial stability, risk and audit committees offers some reassurance. He's not the first insurance man to make such a move: Credit Suisse turned to former Prudential veteran Tidjane Thiam, who is now reworking the lender's business model and carrying out extensive cost-cutting. Mr. Thiam is finding that a turnaround won't come without significant pain.
Shareholders at AIA were disappointed with Mr. Tucker's departure, with its share price dropping almost 3% on Monday in Hong Kong. But their counterparts at HSBC sent the stock up 2.4%. With a tailwind from higher U.S. rates, HSBC's new chairman-to-be should be well-positioned to set the course.

Crisis Vets Urge GOP to Keep Bank-Resolution Tool
Ben Bernanke, Lawrence Summers and other top crisis-era policy makers have a message for congressional Republicans and the Trump administration: if you don't want bailouts, keep a key provision of Dodd-Frank.
The alumni of the meltdown and its aftermath are urging lawmakers to preserve Title II of the 2010 regulatory- overhaul law. The section lays out orderly liquidation authority, a process that empowers the federal government to take over and wind down a failing financial firm in emergency situations. Trump administration officials, including White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have criticized OLA for failing to preclude the need for bailing out failing banks.
""We are going to probably at some point talk about whether OLA works and whether OLA should ever be triggered, because no one thinks that we really solved 'too big to fail,'"" Mr. Cohn said in a Wall Street Journal interview last month.
The GOP is in a rare position of strength given its control of both chambers of Congress and the White House. But without a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, much of the party's deregulatory wish list will have to go through the budget reconciliation process. That means that in many cases, Republicans will be able to make changes only to regulations that have a budgetary impact, such as OLA (as my colleague Ryan Tracy laid out in detail ).
Messrs. Summers and Bernanke, in essays published in January and February, respectively, argue that gutting OLA would be a terrible mistake.
""This repeal, if enacted, will exacerbate moral hazard, impair financial stability, increase economic vulnerability and in all likelihood increase the national debt,"" Mr. Summers, who was director of the NEC under President Barack Obama, wrote in the Washington Post .
Mr. Bernanke, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, echoed Mr. Summers's dire language about the importance of OLA.
""It is an essential tool for ensuring that financial stress does not escalate into a catastrophic crisis,"" Mr. Bernanke wrote in a blog post for the Brookings Institution . He argued that bankruptcy proceedings--as laid out in Title I of Dodd Frank--aren't capable of speedily resolving a firm in turmoil during a ""period of high financial stress."" He also defended OLA against criticisms that it is a ""thinly disguised, taxpayer-funded bailout."" As part of OLA, the Federal

Deposit Insurance Corp. is authorized to use Treasury Department funds to provide temporary liquidity to a firm undergoing resolution, but Mr. Bernanke noted that all costs are ultimately borne by private actors like the stakeholders of the failing firm.
As with other aspects of financial deregulation, it remains to be seen whether a repeal of OLA has the support necessary to pass the Senate, even with a simple majority. But the old guard clearly wants to make sure the idea is shelved.
Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond
Bharara's Probes Likely to Continue After His Exit
By Nicole Hong, Erica Orden and Peter Nicholas
The sudden departure of the top U.S. prosecutor in Manhattan raises uncertainty about the federal government's approach to trying financial crimes and global terrorism cases, even as it isn't likely to change the course of several high-profile investigations.
Preet Bharara was fired as Manhattan U.S. attorney on Saturday, a day after the Justice Department asked the 46 remaining U.S. attorneys appointed by ex-President Barack Obama to step down.
While it isn't unusual for a new administration to fire holdover U.S. attorneys, Mr. Bharara's refusal to resign is extremely rare, and it was surprising given that then-President-elect Donald Trump had invited him to Trump Tower in late November and asked him to stay on as Manhattan U.S. attorney, Mr. Bharara told reporters at the time.
The Manhattan U.S. attorney has wide jurisdiction in prosecuting financial crimes and other white-collar cases, and prosecutors in that office have been particularly aggressive in charging and arresting people outside the U.S. for federal crimes like terrorism, sanctions violations and cybercrime. Mr. Bharara, who has served in the role since 2009, had become prominent with a string of insider-trading and public-corruption investigations.
Mr. Trump had tried to phone Mr. Bharara on Thursday--two days before the firing--to thank him for his service and ""to wish him luck,"" a White House aide said Sunday.
After receiving the message that Mr. Trump was trying to reach him, Mr. Bharara called Joseph ""Jody"" Hunt, chief of staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, to say it was inappropriate for the president to be contacting U.S. attorneys, ""particularly ones that have jurisdictions over important matters,"" according to a person familiar with the call.
Mr. Hunt agreed it was inappropriate, and Mr. Bharara suggested that Mr. Hunt convey that information immediately to Mr. Sessions, the person familiar said. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment on the call.
The White House appears to be unhappy with Mr. Bharara's handling of the situation. In reference to Mr. Bharara's ouster, the White House aide said: ""The U.S. attorneys are political appointees, and all 46 of the holdovers from the Obama administration received the same resignation letter. It's fair to say that 45 of the 46 behaved in a manner befitting the office.""
The aide added: ""As much as Preet wants everything to be about Preet, everyone was treated the same way.""
Mr. Bharara, in response to the White House's comments, said: ""It was my understanding that the president himself has said anonymous sources are not to be believed.""
The firings don't force pending investigations across the country to be put on hold, as U.S. attorney's offices have career prosecutors who will fill in until new ones are confirmed. In Manhattan, Mr. Bharara's departure is unlikely to have a significant impact on continuing probes, largely because the interim leader of the office, Joon Kim, is a close friend and longtime colleague of Mr. Bharara's.
Since 2013, Mr. Kim has served in various leadership roles within the Southern District of New York, including most recently as deputy U.S. attorney.
""We anticipate that the work of the office will continue for the foreseeable future with minimal disruptions,"" said a lawyer within the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office.
Most notably, Mr. Bharara leaves behind his office's yearlong probe into New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio , a Democrat, and his aides in connection with a corruption investigation into the mayor's fundraising operations. That
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 384 of 1177

probe has escalated in recent weeks, with federal prosecutors questioning both the mayor and one of his top aides, according to people familiar with the matter.
The mayor has said he and his allies have done nothing wrong and have followed the law.
It is also unclear whether the office's pursuit of white-collar crime, an enforcement area where the Southern District has been a pioneer since the 1960s, might shift. Mr. Bharara's office secured more than 80 insider-trading convictions in recent years, exposing webs of improper tips and favors that reached across Wall Street to some of the most successful and wealthy hedge-fund managers. Along the way, Mr. Bharara has been criticized for not holding individual executives accountable for actions related to the financial crisis.
Mr. Bharara's departure will be closely watched in financial circles because he oversaw the increased use of wiretaps and confidential informants in white-collar cases--basically treating them no differently than drug cases. This was a successful but controversial approach, and it is unclear whether his successor would employ similar tactics amid pressure by some defense lawyers and others.
Spokespeople for the Justice Department and the White House declined to comment on when Mr. Trump would name a permanent successor to Mr. Bharara.
Messrs. Bharara and Kim both joined the Southern District in 2000, where they sat near each other as entry-level line prosecutors and often went out drinking, according to a person familiar with their relationship. Mr. Bharara was the one who brought Mr. Kim back to government in 2013, after Mr. Kim had spent seven years working at law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen &Hamilton LLP.
To this day, their families are friends, the person familiar said.
Mr. Kim returned to the office just as Mr. Bharara was preparing to prioritize public-corruption cases, his handling of which has upended politics in Albany and New York City in recent years.
Mr. Kim has been personally involved in those investigations. The office has convicted both one-time state legislative leaders, brought charges against nine people with close ties to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and is handling its probe of Mr. de Blasio and his aides.
Last fall, Mr. Kim was present at the questioning by federal prosecutors of Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, according to a person familiar with the matter, and he also attended the questioning of Mr. de Blasio by assistant U.S. attorneys in recent weeks.
Mr. Cuomo hasn't been charged with wrongdoing. The case against Mr. Cuomo's longtime top aide Joseph Percoco and others close to the governor is expected to go to trial by the end of the year.
Mr. Bharara's firing comes amid a tumultuous start to Mr. Sessions's stint as U.S. attorney general. On March 2, Mr. Sessions said he would recuse himself from any investigations into Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential elections. He did so after his office said he had met twice with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the presidential race, despite testifying at his confirmation hearing in January that he did not have ""communications with the Russians.""
Beyond the next few months, it remains to be seen how the Southern District's priorities might change under Mr. Sessions and the Trump administration. The Southern District has long had a reputation for operating independently of Washington, which has sometimes been a source of frustration for the Justice Department and for other U.S. attorney's offices, according to former federal prosecutors.
In his first month leading the Justice Department, Mr. Sessions has made lowering violent crime a priority and is traveling to Richmond, Va., on Wednesday to speak about the issue with law enforcement. Whether the emphasis on violent crime trickles down to U.S. attorney's offices like the Southern District is an open question.
One person long seen in the New York City legal community as a possible successor to Mr. Bharara under a Trump administration is Marc Mukasey, a white-collar defense lawyer who works at Greenberg Traurig LLP, the law firm that also employs longtime Trump adviser and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Mukasey's father is former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who sat near Mr. Sessions during his confirmation hearing and testified on his behalf.
The younger Mr. Mukasey declined to comment.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 385 of 1177

Mr. Sessions has already made comments that could signal future disagreements between the Justice Department and the Southern District. In a recent radio interview, he expressed concerns about trying international terrorists in federal courts in New York, saying he preferred using the military commissions at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.
Both the Manhattan and Brooklyn U.S. attorney's offices have a long history of securing convictions from international terrorists in federal court. The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, in particular, pursued some of the earliest terrorism prosecutions in the 1990s and was at the heart of the debate after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks about whether terrorists captured overseas could be tried in civilian courts.
During Mr. Bharara's tenure, there were several high-profile terrorism trials in Manhattan federal court, including one that led to the jury conviction and life sentence of Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, the son-in-law of Osama bin Laden. Manhattan federal prosecutors have also been particularly aggressive in charging and arresting individuals outside the U.S. At a 2015 speech, Mr. Bharara said: ""Somebody once made the mistake of asking me, 'What again is your jurisdiction exactly?' And I said, 'Are you familiar with Earth?' ""
These international cases have required significant cooperation from law enforcement in other countries. That level of cooperation may be affected by the arrival of the Trump administration, given the president's emphasis on an ""America first"" posture in foreign affairs, according to former federal prosecutors.
WSJ Pro First: CFPB, Justice Department Poised to Square Off in Court
By Yuka Hayashi
WASHINGTON--A court case questioning the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is about to take an unusual turn, with the Trump administration's Justice Department expected to oppose the independent watchdog agency--one of only a few instances in recent decades where two federal entities square off in court. Justice Department lawyers indicated earlier in March that they would side with PHH Corp., the mortgage lender challenging the CFPB's structure, as they requested an extension of the deadline for submitting briefs weighing in on the case.
The court has extended the deadline to Friday. Oral arguments are scheduled for May 24.
The PHH case has gone through various twists and turns in recent months, as a federal appeals court ruled the CFPB's structure unconstitutional and gave the president power to remove its director at will. The holding was invalidated four months later by the same court, paving the way for a rehearing. Meanwhile, the case has become part of a thorny political battle as Republicans look for ways to weaken the CFPB, which they have long criticized as an example of regulatory overreach.
In the request to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the Justice Department lawyers led by Chad Readler, acting assistant attorney general, didn't specifically say they would oppose the CFPB, but alluded to their position by saying that ""the views of the U.S. on matters involving the president's removal power are not always entirely congruent with the view of independent agencies.""
""It would be a significant development if you have the Department of Justice arguing that a federal statute is unconstitutional,"" said Joe Palmore, co-chairman of the appellate and Supreme Court practice group at law firm Morrison &Foerster LLP, who works with trade groups critical of the CFPB. ""The members of the court would certainly pay attention to what the U.S. says.""
Trump administration officials have indicated they want to install new leadership at the CFPB but have acknowledged the pending court case is an obstacle. A White House representative said last month that President Donald Trump believed the CFPB was unaccountable and that the initial decision made by the three-judge panel at the D.C. Circuit court was correct.
In a Friday filing related to the rehearing, PHH said the CFPB was plagued by ""many constitutional problems"" and that giving the president power to remove the director at will won't be enough to resolve the case. ""The appropriate remedy is to strike down the CFPB in its entirety,"" lawyers representing PHH wrote. ""There can be no remand to an unconstitutional agency.""
Legal experts say court cases in which two government entities confront each other are extremely rare.

Among them, 1988's Morrison v. Olson stands out owing to its similarity to the current case. That case involved a dispute between the House Judiciary Committee and the Justice Department over the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate an Environmental Protection Agency program. A Justice Department lawyer argued that naming an independent counsel who couldn't be removed by the president was a violation of the Constitution's separation of powers clause. The lawyer, whose claim was rejected by the Supreme Court, was Theodore Olson, then assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel, who now represents PHH in the case against the CFPB.
Among other big cases that involved government agencies facing off is 1990's Metro Broadcasting Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission, in which the Justice Department sided with the company that challenged the FCC's policy giving preference to minority broadcasters in obtaining licenses. The Supreme Court sided with the FCC.
In general, agencies in the executive branch speak with a single voice on legal questions. But it is possible for the Justice Department, which is run by an attorney general who answers to the president, to take a legal position opposing the head of an independent agency who doesn't, said Aditya Bamzai, an assistant professor at University of Virginia School of Law. ""The very nature of independence creates this possibility, which might happen in the PHH case,"" he said.
The court's February decision to throw out the panel's ruling and rehear the case came after the Obama administration's Justice Department requested such a step.
Once the D.C. Circuit court hands down its ruling, more unusual questions will arise, this time about the role of the Justice Department in the possible appeal proceedings to the Supreme Court. The CFPB is authorized to defend itself in federal appeals court but must be represented by the Justice Department at the Supreme Court. Arguing that the CFPB wouldn't be adequately defended by Mr. Trump's Justice Department, Democratic lawmakers and consumer groups earlier asked the court for permission to intervene in the case. The request was rejected.

SEC Denies Winklevoss Application for Bitcoin ETF
By Dave Michaels and Paul Vigna
The Securities and Exchange Commission denied an application for the first exchange-traded fund that would track the price of bitcoin, a high-profile rejection for the digital currency and the Winklevoss brothers behind the proposal.
Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and their Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust first applied for approval of the product nearly four years ago. The bitcoin industry had been hoping an exchange-traded product would make the currency attractive to Wall Street and retail investors. The denial sets that back, at least momentarily, and sent the price of bitcoin tumbling.
The price, which traded as high as $1,326 on Friday in anticipation of a possible approval, plummeted to as low as $1,022 after the SEC decision on heavy trading volume that reportedly led to delays on some bitcoin exchanges. It was most recently trading at $1,108.
The SEC's judgment, posted in an order on the regulator's website, marks the end, for now, of a long and drawn-out odyssey to package bitcoin into an exchange-traded product that could create a broader investor base for the virtual currency. The shares would have traded under the symbol COIN on the Bats BZX Exchange, operated by CBOE Holdings Inc..
""We remain optimistic and committed to bringing COIN to market, and look forward to continuing to work with the SEC staff,"" said Tyler Winklevoss, the chief financial officer of Digital Asset Services, LLC. ""We began this journey almost four years ago, and are determined to see it through.""
The SEC provided two main reasons for the denial, both related to bitcoin itself and the markets in which it trades. That could mean other proposed bitcoin products will face the same objections.
Under the law, the exchange listing the bitcoin product--in this case, Bats--must have agreements with significant exchanges that monitor trading in the commodity. The SEC said the only agreement Bats had was with the Gemini Exchange, which trades bitcoin, and that it didn't pass muster because it isn't sufficiently regulated.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 387 of 1177

Most bitcoin exchanges aren't regulated, and are spread across the globe from the U.S. to Europe to China. That means that Bats would simply be unable to enter into any kind of surveillance agreements with those exchanges that would satisfy the rules, the SEC said.
""We agree with the SEC that regulation and oversight are important to the health of any marketplace and the safety of all investors,"" Mr. Winklevoss said.
Bats declined to comment.
""The SEC is essentially saying that until significant bitcoin markets are regulated, the listing exchange really can't address concerns about the potential for manipulative trading,"" said Michael Mundt, a partner at law firm Stradley Ronon Stevens &Young LLP who formerly regulated exchange-traded products at the SEC.
The decision comes at a time when SEC officials have voiced concern about the growing complexity of some exchange-traded products and how volatile they can be during market routs. Trading in hundreds of ETPs was halted during a wild trading session on Aug. 24, 2015, when the market value of their shares diverged widely from the underlying holdings.
Bats and CBOE could appeal a staff denial, and they also could rewrite the proposal based upon feedback that could make the product more acceptable to regulators.
There are two other applications for similar bitcoin products on the SEC's desk, from Grayscale Investments LLC and SolidX Management LLC. The deadline on the latter, March 30, is fast approaching.
Representatives from both firms declined to comment.
Grayscale's product has an interesting wrinkle, in that it already trades publicly on an over-the-counter exchange to accredited investors. The firm is seeking to also list it on the New York Stock Exchange. It closed up 6.3% on Friday, moments before the SEC ruling was released, at $135.
Former SEC Chairman Mary Jo White in a May 2016 speech said, ""Despite the popularity and broad success of these funds, their history is not without some turbulence,"" She at the time announced a task force that would focus on concerns about how some ETPs trade.

The Securities and Exchange Commission decided to deny an application for the first exchange-traded product that tracks the price of bitcoin. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the SEC is denying an application for an exchange. (March 10)
Credit Reports to Exclude Certain Negative Data, Boosting FICO Scores
By AnnaMaria Andriotis
Many tax liens and civil judgments soon will be taken off people's credit reports, the latest move to omit negative information from the powerful financial scorecards.
The decision by the three major credit-reporting firms-- Equifax Inc., Experian PLC and TransUnion--could help boost credit scores for millions of U.S. consumers, but could pose risks for lenders. The reports and scores often help decide how much consumers can borrow for a new house or car as well as determine their credit-card spending limit.
The unusual move by the influential firms comes partially in response to regulatory concerns. The three reporting bureaus rarely tinker with the information that goes on credit reports and that lenders consult to gauge consumers' ability and willingness to pay back debts.
Equifax, Experian and TransUnion recently decided to remove tax-lien and civil-judgment data starting around July 1, according to the Consumer Data Industry Association, a trade group that represents them. The firms will do so if those data don't include a complete list of at least three data points: a person's name, address and either a social security number or date of birth.
Many liens and most judgments don't include all three or four. This change will apply to new tax-lien and civil- judgment data that are added to credit reports as well as existing data on the reports.
The result will make many people who have these types of credit-report blemishes look more creditworthy.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau earlier this month released a report citing problems it found while
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 388 of 1177

examining credit bureaus and changes it is requiring. Issues the agency cited included improving standards for public-records data by using better identity-matching criteria and updating records more frequently.
Inaccurate information on credit reports, especially if it is negative information, can derail consumers from being able to gain access to credit and even lead to other setbacks like not being able to rent an apartment or get a job. One in five consumers has an error in at least one of their three major credit reports, according to a 2013 Federal Trade Commission study mandated by Congress. The three credit bureaus received around eight million requests disputing information on credit reports in 2011, according to the CFPB.
In 2015, the credit-reporting firms reached a settlement with New York's attorney general over several practices, including how they handle errors. This was followed by one with another 31 states. One more state, Mississippi, followed last year.
The state settlements already had prompted the credit-reporting firms to remove several negative data sets from reports. These included non-loan related items that were sent to collections firms, such as gym memberships, library fines and traffic tickets. The firms also will have to remove medical-debt collections that have been paid by a patient's insurance company from credit reports by 2018.
Such changes might help borrowers and could spur additional lending, possibly boosting economic activity. But it could potentially increase risks for lenders who might not be able to accurately assess borrowers' default risk. Consumers with liens or judgments are twice as likely to default on loan payments, according to LexisNexis Risk Solutions, a unit of RELX Group that supplies public-record information to the big three credit bureaus and lenders. ""It's going to make someone who has poor credit look better than they should,"" said John Ulzheimer, a credit specialist and former manager at Experian and credit-score creator FICO. ""Just because the lien or judgment information has been removed and someone's score has improved doesn't mean they'll magically become a better credit risk.""
Removing this information from credit reports also will lead to changes in people's credit scores. Roughly 12 million U.S. consumers, or about 6% of the total U.S. population that has FICO credit scores, will see increases in those scores as a result of this change, according to the company that created the FICO system, which is used by lenders in most U.S. consumer underwriting decisions.
For most of these consumers, the score increase will be relatively modest. FICO projects that just under 11 million people will experience a score improvement of less than 20 points. FICO scores range from 300 to 850. The higher the score, the more creditworthy a consumer generally is.
Scores are projected to rise by at least 40 points for around 700,000 consumers, according to FICO. In many cases, that can mean the difference between getting approved for credit or denied it.
Civil judgments include cases in which collection firms take borrowers to court over an unpaid debt. Ankush Tewari, senior director of credit-risk assessment at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, says that nearly all judgments will be removed and about half of tax liens will be removed from credit reports as a result of the changed approach. He says LexisNexis will continue to offer the data directly to lenders.
In addition, if public court records aren't checked for updates on lien and judgment information at least every 90 days, they will have to be removed from credit reports.
Lenders will still be able to check public records on their own to find this information.
Analysis: It's Time for a Revolution in Investor Disclosures
By Jason Zweig
As far as most investors are concerned, the standard warning in prospectuses -- ""past performance does not guarantee future results"" -- might as well read ""Wjxsndf omv gyjrhubji qmta gjq ek blgy zbq oynru.""
A new initiative at the Securities and Exchange Commission could be one small step in the right direction. On March 10, the SEC is holding its first ""evidence summit"" on how to simplify and clarify financial disclosures.
""The SEC does a good job of providing disclosure of all the information that the most sophisticated investors would find useful,"" says Rick Fleming, the agency's investor advocate. ""But with this new program we're looking to do a better job of making disclosure more useful to the average person.""
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 389 of 1177

Financial disclosures need more than a tweaking. ""The idea that you can just give people some paper and change their behavior is absurd,"" says George Loewenstein, a behavioral economist at Carnegie Mellon University.
Millions of Americans get heaps of prospectuses, proxy statements and periodic financial reports for mutual funds and other investments every year. In a world of multisensory, electronic information, these dead-tree documents still arrive by snail mail, dozens of impenetrable pages that can only be described as chloroform in print.
And, for all their detail, these disclosures don't even inform the people who receive them.
A recent survey of 750 wealthy investors by Natixis Global Asset Management found that 71% believe that index funds are ""less risky"" than other investments.
However, nearly all index funds are designed to be as risky as the markets they invest in. If the S&P 500 goes down 30% in a year, for instance, an S&P 500 index fund charging 0.1% in annual expenses will lose 30.1%.
In a study just published in the Journal of Behavioral Finance, graduate business students chose among four index funds identical in all respects except fees. Students who didn't review standard SEC disclosures about the importance of minimizing fees put an average of 50% of their money into the more-expensive funds. Those who got the information about fees still put a wealth-wasting 47% into the higher-cost portfolios.
""We thought the disclosure would mitigate the problem,"" says co-author Nathan Mauck, a finance professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, ""but it didn't.""
People are not stupid. What they are is busy and lazy. Pressed for time, with countless stimuli tugging at our attention, not many of us want to bother spending hours, days or weeks focusing on a decision -- no matter how much is at stake.
Many experiments have shown that the harder a risk is to understand, the less it will seem likely to occur. Paradoxically, then, financial documents that discuss every conceivable risk in highly technical detail may end up making the investment seem safer.
What can be done?
Moving away from paper to interactive, online displays would create ""a format that is comparable and consistent across investments,"" says Eric Johnson, a professor at Columbia Business School who studies consumer decision- making. Instead of reading that your fund charges 1.13% in annual expenses, for instance, you could see 1.13% placed on a spectrum from the cheapest fund in its category to the most expensive.
Daniel Goldstein and Jake Hofman are behavioral scientists at Microsoft Research, a unit of the computer giant. They have shown that numbers become much easier to grasp -- and remember -- when the words ""to put this in perspective"" are coupled with a familiar reference.
Today's prospectuses show cumulative fees on a $10,000 investment over one, three, five and 10 years. Instead, an investor should be able to see those fee totals for any amount or time period she chooses.
If stocks gained an average of 6% annually over the next 30 years, someone who invested $25,000 and paid a 1% yearly fee would cumulatively forgo more than $35,500 in gains. ""To put this in perspective,"" the disclosure might say, ""that difference is greater than the amount you started with.""
Simulations -- video-game-like displays animating the range of outcomes based on past experience -- could convey risk and return more memorably than words or numbers can do.
Ultimately, disclosures could become ""more like a teaching tool,"" says Prof. Loewenstein of "

HSBC,HSBC: Fresh Eyes Give Investors Hope for Change; AIA chief Mark Tucker will bring an outsider's view to chairman role," Mar 13, 2017",0,"HSBC is stepping out of its comfort zone in picking its first chairman from outside its executive ranks. In Mark Tucker, the hard-charging, entrepreneurial chief executive of insurer AIA, it has chosen someone of a very different breed.
Investors will hope the bank has found a chairman who can pick up the pace at an institution whose privileged history --it was for decades Hong Kong's de facto central bank--has at times slowed it down. HSBC has become good at returning capital, but partly because it is struggling to find profitable growth.
Mr. Tucker will be a nonexecutive chairman, but he will be an engaged and demanding one for HSBC's mostly Hong Kong- and London-based executives. The bank needs a tune up and Mr. Tucker has the potential to make some people's lives uncomfortable. That is undoubtedly part of the plan, but a shake-up isn't without risks.
For HSBC, much will depend on who he puts up as chief executive when Stuart Gulliver retires next year. For clues, look at what HSBC needs to do better.
The biggest issue is getting more juice out of its global commercial and investment banking businesses. HSBC
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 401 of 1177
does a huge amount of corporate lending at low returns, but struggles to turn those relationships into more capital markets, advisory and other ancillary business. That holds back its return on equity.
The next chief executive will need to bring expertise and fresh ideas there. Internally, that could point to another relative outsider like Matthew Westerman, a recent recruit from Goldman Sachs who is co-head of global banking, HSBC's name for traditional investment banking.
Two outsiders at the top of HSBC really would be radical. Fresh minds without attachments to the way things have always been done could revitalize the bank.
The bank has had to change already: it has endured real discomfort after misbehavior at its Swiss, Mexican and other arms exposed it to penalties and very public reprimands. Mr. Tucker, who has long experience of financial services in Asia and the U.K. as well as serving on Goldman Sachs's board since 2012, will have to manage the legacy of this and sharpen up the rest. His biggest challenge will be working out just how hard to push.

HSBC,Kuwait Launches $8 Billion Bond Sale; Persian Gulf state is the latest to turn to debt markets to make up for oil revenue slide," Mar 13, 2017",0,"DUBAI--Kuwait intends to raise $8 billion in its debut international bond sale, bankers familiar with the deal said Monday, the latest Persian Gulf state to turn to the debt markets to offset a slide in oil income.
Kuwait, one of the world's largest oil exporters, launched the two-tranche bond sale after receiving about $29 billion worth of orders, the bankers said. Final pricing was tighter than the initial guidance at 0.75 percentage point above U.S. Treasurys for the 5-year, $3.5 billion tranche and 1 percentage point above U.S. Treasurys for the 10- year, $4.5 billion portion.
The oil exporters of the Persian Gulf are issuing bonds at their fastest clip since last year as governments across the region seek fresh funds to shore up their coffers. Lower oil revenues have also pushed the Gulf nations to introduce far-reaching economic reforms such as raising taxes and cutting spending to counter widening budget deficits.
Oman raised $5 billion earlier this month, while Saudi Arabia sold a mammoth $17.5 billion bond in 2016. Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Bahrain all tapped international markets last year.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 403 of 1177
Both Kuwait and Oman tapped the debt market ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting this week where policy makers are expected to raise interest rates, lifting borrowing costs.
Like its Gulf neighbors, Kuwait's government relies heavily on crude exports for its budget financing needs. Following the drop in oil prices since the middle of 2014, Kuwait last year for the first time posted a budget deficit. Government efforts at pushing through fiscal reforms have met with resistance in the country's parliament. Kuwait nevertheless boasts the lowest break-even oil price among the Gulf countries and is also home to one of the world's largest sovereign-wealth funds, the Kuwait Investment Authority. It is rated AA with stable outlook by both Standard &Poor's and Fitch.
""The decision to borrow from external markets will mean less withdrawals from KIA (Kuwait Invest Authority),"" said Giyas Gokkent, an economist covering the Middle East and North Africa at the Institute of International Finance. ""With global interest rates still at low levels, it makes sense for Kuwait to borrow particularly since KIA could generate higher returns on its own funds,"" Mr. Gokkent said.
Kuwait's Finance Minister Anas al-Saleh last year said the country was considering a $10 billion bond sale. Fixed-income analysts at Dubai-based Mashreq said the final amount Kuwait is raising is lower than previously announced because of a rebound in oil prices after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on a production cut in November, resulting in lower projected external financing needs for the country.
Citi, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, J.P. Morgan, NBK Capital and Standard Chartered are bookrunners on Kuwait's bond sale.

HSBC,Demanding and Direct: HSBC's New Chairman Mark Tucker; Bank's new chairman could lead a major shake-up of the British lender's culture," Mar 13, 2017",0,"Corrections &Amplifications

capitalization. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated it had become the second-largest insurance company by market capitalization.
Mark Tucker, the first outsider tapped as chairman of HSBC Holdings PLC, is a savvy businessman with intimate knowledge of the U.K. and Asian markets where the bank principally operates.
But people who know the hard-driving Mr. Tucker say one of his biggest effects on the 152-year-old British lender could be a shake-up of what some describe as a bureaucratic, clubby culture.
Mr. Tucker, 59, ran Hong Kong-based insurer AIA Group Ltd. for seven years, taking it from a unit of American International Group Inc. to the second-largest life insurance company in the world by market capitalization. He has been described by people who work with him as demanding and direct--someone who keeps staffers constantly on their toes.
Associates say he emails at all hours, responds to others quickly and keeps track of who delivers on commitments--and who doesn't.
Those qualities could stir things up at HSBC, which critics say has resembled the civil service, filled with employees who feel they are guaranteed jobs for life. HSBC also has admitted to having too many layers of management.
""He doesn't suffer fools, that is for sure,"" said one Asia-based business associate of Mr. Tucker, who asked not to be named because he wasn't authorized to speak on the record. ""You have to pass a bit of a sniff test before he'll give you the time you need.""
Mr. Tucker declined to comment for this article. A spokeswoman for HSBC declined to comment.
The hiring of Mr. Tucker is a big departure for HSBC, which for decades promoted its chief executive into the chairman role, usually at the end of a lifetime career at the bank.
At HSBC, one of Mr. Tucker's most important tasks will be appointing a new chief executive to replace current CEO Stuart Gulliver, who expects to step down in 2018. Some candidates are HSBC's global retail banking head John Flint, who has been at the bank since 1989, and HSBC Bank PLC CEO Antonio Simoes, who joined in 2007.
But external candidates will also have a strong shot and could be the preference of the bank's investors. One successful recent outside hire has been former Goldman Sachs banker Matthew Westerman, who a year ago was brought on as co-head of global banking. Mr. Westerman restructured the group, clearing out a cadre of senior managers and raising internal performance standards.
Established in 1865, HSBC was formed to finance trade after the Hong Kong and Shanghai ports opened up in the wake of the First Opium War. HSBC long functioned as Hong Kong's de facto central bank. When the territory was under British control, HSBC's chairman often held Hong Kong political appointments as well.
By 2009, the bank was in 88 countries and creaking under an outdated structure in which dozens of country heads reported directly to the CEO. It had to adapt to higher capital requirements and spent billions of dollars improving its systems after U.S. authorities said its money-laundering checks had failed.
Recently, HSBC has pared businesses and exited countries but it is still far from meeting a return on equity target of more than 10%, and reported worse than expected fourth-quarter results. There are also question marks around its plan to invest more in China retail banking and a domestic securities business, which analysts say could take a decade or more to pay off.
""Bringing an outsider's view and an innate sense of urgency will be immensely helpful"" to turning around HSBC, said Jonathan Larsen, a former senior Citigroup executive who worked closely with Mr. Tucker on an insurance distribution deal.
A former professional soccer player in the U.K., Mr. Tucker expanded Prudential PLC's business across Asia in the 1990s, and worked as the finance director at British lender HBOS PLC while it was on a lending binge in the mid- 2000s.
Mr. Tucker joined AIA in 2010 when AIG was readying it for a listing in Hong Kong. Under his leadership, the insurer's share price has more than doubled and its new-business value, a key measure of insurers' profitability, has quadrupled to $2.75 billion in 2016. The company has expanded into new markets and built its business in
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 406 of 1177

China even as economic growth there slowed.
Mr. Tucker has served as a board member of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. since 2012, a role he will give up. Between 2009 and 2012, he was a nonexecutive director at the Bank of England.
Mr. Tucker is hands-on when it comes to striking deals, say people familiar with his management style, sending emails with detailed questions about agreements and negotiations that in other deals are often sent by bankers. He pulled the plug on bids for Dah Sing Financial Holdings Ltd.'s life-insurance businesses and Ageas NV's Hong Kong life insurance business while at AIA, according to people familiar with the matter, balking at the high offers put forth by others.

Republicans' Health Arithmetic
The number of Americans without health insurance would grow by 24 million over the next decade under a House Republican proposal to replace most of the Affordable Care Act, according to a nonpartisan report that is likely to complicate GOP lawmakers' efforts to unite around the plan. The Congressional Budget Office projections were disputed by the bill's backers, but rattled some centrist Senate Republicans who have said they won't support legislation that leaves a large number of people without coverage. President Trump campaigned on a pledge to cover all Americans. The CBO also projected the legislation would reduce the federal deficit by $337 billion over the

Autonomous Autos
Chip maker Intel has agreed to buy Israeli car-camera pioneer Mobileye for $15.3 billion--one of its biggest acquisitions ever--in the latest Silicon Valley bet on a vision of cars as turbocharged computers on wheels. The purchase would give Intel a widely used technology in the rapidly emerging business of computer-assisted driving, as well as Mobileye's customer relationships with auto makers including GM, Volkswagen and Honda. Having largely missed the smartphone revolution, Intel is paying 62 times forward earnings--all its offshore cash and then some--to join the accelerating autonomous-vehicle race , which has sparked bidding wars for companies that specialize in self-driving gear or software.
Air War
We report that Mr. Trump has given the CIA secret authority to conduct drone strikes against suspected terrorists, changing the Obama administration's policy of limiting the spy agency's paramilitary role--and reopening a CIA- Pentagon turf war. The new authority, not previously disclosed, represents a significant departure from the practice that had become standard by the end of former President Barack Obama's tenure: The CIA used drones and other intelligence resources to locate suspected terrorists but left the actual strikes to the military. The agency first used its new authority in late February on a senior al Qaeda leader in Syria, U.S. officials said.

Responding to yesterday's question on pension-risk transfer, Augusta Era Golian of Texas said: ""Some companies have made inflation adjustments to their pensioners to keep them whole, even though not legally required. It's doubtful that insurance companies will do so--increasing pressure on retirees just as the federal government seems to be thinning the safety net."" Bill Sanders of Colorado wrote: ""There are basically three factors in pricing the liability (cost) of a pension-risk transfer: expenses, mortality and investment return. In assuming this liability, the winning insurance company is projecting these factors decades into the future. Better make sure the insurance company is solid and will be around to make these pension payments."" And Jerome Schmid of South Carolina commented: ""Sad to see defined-benefit plans slip away into history. But employers no longer care about employee welfare (despite volumes of acclamations in various mission statements), as once-paternalistic corporations have been reduced to financial schemes, manipulated like exotic derivative securities. It is probably a very good idea to turn over the plans to insurance companies who are staffed with people who are (thought to be) competent risk managers, and who are far more likely be around 10 years from now.""

HSBC,"Why Analysts Missed the Fed's Signals on Raising Rates; Markets now see it as a near-certainty, but many thought the bank would hold off because of its previous moves and Trump's plans"," Mar 15, 2017",1,"Investors rely on analysts to tell them how the Federal Reserve is likely to move interest rates. Until just a few days ago, however, many of those experts missed signals that the central bank would lift borrowing costs on Wednesday.
Strong hiring, firming inflation, buoyant stock markets, a placid global economic outlook and Chairwoman Janet Yellen's upbeat congressional testimony last month didn't fundamentally alter Wall Street's view that the Fed would hold rates steady until later this year. This despite Fed officials saying they anticipated three moves in 2017. Neither did it seem to matter to the markets when, three weeks ago, minutes of the Fed's most recent meeting on Jan. 31-Feb. 1 showed that officials thought they'd likely move ""fairly soon.""
It wasn't until Feb. 28, when Fed officials launched a barrage of public comments clearly signaling an imminent rate increase, that analysts and markets began expecting the move on Wednesday, which markets now see as a near-certainty.
""We have completely flipped our position,"" Brett Ewing, chief market strategist for First Franklin Financial Services, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.
How did so many get it wrong?
Analysts point to a number of reasons. Some say they were expecting the Trump administration to impose trade curbs that could stifle economic growth. Others thought Fed officials would prefer to sit tight until they got a clearer picture of the new president's policies. And several pointed to the experience of 2015 and 2016, when the cautious central bank delivered fewer rate increases than it had projected. Officials penciled in three rate increases for 2015 and four for 2016, but delivered just one in each year.
That left investors feeling ""burned,"" Mr. Ewing said.
Before each of the rate increases in 2015 and 2016, Fed officials used the statement released at the preceding meeting to send a strong signal that an increase was coming, but they didn't do this on Feb. 1 after the latest meeting concluded.
""It appeared there was a pattern developing,"" said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan. Mr. Feroli originally predicted the Fed would raise rates twice in 2017, with the first move coming in May.
""There was no signal like that in the February statement, so I think we and many others concluded, well, there's an economic case for March but they're just not saying it,"" he said. ""That's why we went to May.""
After hearing the recent comments from Fed officials, Mr. Feroli revised his forecast to include three rate increases for 2017-in March, June and September.
Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, said he thought the Trump administration would put in place tariffs or other trade restrictions early in the year. That would cause a short-term boost to inflation but also curb growth, he said. Mr. Gapen predicted the Fed would look past that temporary inflation increase and focus on lower growth as a reason to hold off on raising rates in March.
""We were actually in the process of thinking about revising the U.S. outlook because the delays in enacting immigration reform and health-care reform, in our minds, were pushing the ability to get trade policies enacted this year down,"" he said. ""Then all the messaging came in from the Fed. Well, this saves us some trouble.""
Mr. Gapen has now upped his forecast from two rate increases this year to three, ""leaning towards four.""
Kathy Bostjancic, head of U.S. macro investor services at Oxford Economics, said she originally thought the uncertainty surrounding fiscal policy would stay the Fed's hand. She thought officials ""would want to wait to get some sense about how growth was going to line up for the end of 2017 and 2018.""
Jose Rasco, chief investment strategist at HSBC, said his bank didn't think the economy was strong enough to justify a move this month. Then came the rally that brought multiple record-setting days in equity markets.
""What has changed is that the Fed governors came out and said they saw this 'release of animal spirits,'"" Mr. Rasco said.
One analyst who entertained the idea of a March rate increase is Roberto Perli, a partner at Cornerstone Macro. In a note following the Feb. 22 release of the Jan. 31-Feb. 1 meeting minutes, Mr. Perli wrote that a March move

""should not be dismissed out of hand.""
In the end, Mr. Ewing said, there is only so much a forecaster can anticipate.
""Nobody knows the future,"" he said. ""We put our best guesstimate out there and we live with that."" Write to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com

HSBC,"Trump's Currency Conundrum Risks Fueling G-20 Trade Tensions; The president thinks the dollar is too high, but his key economic proposals are boosting its value"," Mar 16, 2017",0,"Corrections &Amplifications
In 1985, other nations agreed to appreciate their currencies after the dollar's strength fueled protectionism in the U.S. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated how the nations responded.
BADEN-BADEN, Germany--U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, meeting the world's top financial leaders in Germany on Friday, faces a currency conundrum.
His boss, President Donald Trump, thinks the dollar is too strong while China's yuan and Germany's euro, in particular, are too weak, giving those countries an unfair trade advantage. Yet Mr. Trump's key domestic economic proposals--and rising interest rates in the U.S.--are boosting the dollar's value.
Failure to solve this contradiction could escalate global trade tensions .
""Trump faces an impossible combination of policies if he truly wants a weak dollar,"" said David Bloom, global head of currency research at global bank, HSBC. ""Most of his ideas point to a stronger dollar,"" he said, which will raise manufacturing costs and crimp demand for U.S. products overseas.
Mr. Mnuchin will push finance ministers from China, Japan, Germany and other Group of 20 largest economies to abide by existing currency vows. G-20 nations have pledged not to use their exchange rates for competitive gains. Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized China's yuan policy, accusing the country of keeping its exchange rate artificially low, helping drive a $350 billion annual U.S. trade deficit with China. The administration is drafting plans to sanction countries that devalue their currencies.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi last week said it is the dollar that is overvalued, not the euro that is undervalued. And China's premier Li Keqiang said Wednesday Beijing wouldn't devalue its currency and didn't want a trade war.
Some analysts suspect the administration might be trying to talk the greenback down .

""The administration is trying to pretend that if countries were to stop manipulating their currency, U.S. trade would move closer to balanced,"" said Steven Englander, head of G10 FX strategy at Citigroup Inc. ""The problem is the attractiveness of the U.S. as a place to put capital makes it hard to get that outcome.""
Mr. Mnuchin has reaffirmed a strong-dollar policy but said short-term strength is a concern, compounding the uncertainty over the administration's approach.
Still, many investors are betting the dollar will continue strengthening as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates and the administration pursues corporate tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Hedge funds and other speculative investors currently hold roughly $16 billion in bets on a rising dollar.
Mr. Englander said the dollar could weaken in the near-term if the U.S. signals it will take an aggressive stance on trade negotiations at the G20 meeting, given worries about a trade war. But early signs are that Mr. Mnuchin may play a moderating role.
Adding to Washington's currency challenges, if Beijing were to stop controlling the yuan's value right now, most economists say the country's weakening growth prospects would mean the exchange rate would plummet. The country has burned through $1 trillion dollars propping the yuan up.
""The U.S. doesn't want China to depeg now,"" said Brad Setser a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former top U.S. Treasury official in the Obama administration. A ""free float would see devaluation that could boost Chinese exports, widening the U.S. trade deficit.""
That's the exact opposite of what Mr. Trump says he wants.
When China devalued its currency in August 2015, markets tumbled across the globe as investors feared the widespread repercussions of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.
And too strong a dollar could also roil markets. Emerging economies have stocked up dollar-denominated debt, and a surge in the greenback could trigger severe capital outflows from some of them. Since investors would most likely put their cash into U.S. assets, the dollar would rise further in a dangerous feedback loop.
The International Monetary Fund, the world's currency cop, said last year the dollar was already 10% to 20% over the value market fundamentals warrant. Since then, the greenback has risen by 7% against a basket of currencies. The IMF is worried that a further widening of that imbalance could spur more protectionist pressures in the U.S. and invite retaliation by other nations.
Some experts think a new global exchange-rate accord could be one way to relieve tensions. In 1985, other nations agreed to appreciate their currencies after the dollar's strength fueled protectionism in the U.S.
Ted Truman, a senior fellow at Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former top Treasury official, sees a small but rising probability that this could happen again.
""Compared with a trade war, which would damage everyone a lot more, some adjustment in the currency might be a better alternative,"" Mr. Truman said.

HSBC,Mnuchin Says U.S. Is Seeking to Avoid Trade Wars; Treasury secretary expected to face pressure at G-20 over 'America First' policy," Mar 16, 2017",1,"
BERLIN--U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, facing growing anxieties President Donald Trump's ""America First"" economic platform could trigger a damaging series of retaliatory sanctions around the world, said Thursday the administration doesn't want to start any trade wars .
Rather, Mr. Mnuchin said Washington is trying to rebalance unfair trade relationships that are harming growth in the world's largest economic engine. Fixing those inequalities, such as when countries like China manipulate their exchange rates to gain a competitive trade advantage, actually will spur global growth, he said.
But the Treasury secretary, who will be making his first appearance on the global stage Friday at a gathering of the world's finance chiefs from the Group of 20 industrialized and emerging economies, is facing a tough sell. Besides fears of unilateral sanctions sparking retaliation, Mr. Trump's policies are set to strengthen the dollar, a key sore point for the administration. Failure to solve this currency conundrum could ratchet up global trade tensions.
""Our focus is creating economic growth that is good for the United States and for the rest of the world,"" Mr. Mnuchin said after a meeting with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Scha?uble. ""It is not our desire to get into trade wars, it is our desire to deal with where there is imbalance in certain trade relations,"" he said.
Trump administration threats to level unilateral currency sanctions, vows to rewrite international trade deals and jabs at the World Trade Organization have spooked G-20 nations . Ahead of the G-20 meeting in the resort town of Baden-Baden, Germany, the International Monetary Fund warned that the U.S., China and other large economies risk derailing the global economy if leaders fail to fight a growing protectionist tide.
But the Treasury secretary dismissed those concerns, saying the U.S. is one of the most open markets in the world. ""The president is interested in making sure that our agreements are reciprocal,"" he said. ""He wants free and fair trade.""
Mr. Scha?uble, whose administration has criticized the Trump administration's trade rhetoric, sounded a note of optimism. Berlin is particularly concerned about the U.S. introducing a border-adjusted tax and the White House rolling back some financial regulations.
""We won't solve all problems in Baden-Baden, but the process will continue in a constructive and positive way. That's a very good message,"" he said.
But G-20 delegates were struggling late Thursday to hammer out a consensus on whether to accept a U.S. proposal to adopt a commitment to ""free and fair trade,"" rather than past G-20 vows to avoid all forms of protectionism, an official from one of the countries said.
The U.S. administration is facing a policy contradiction. Mr. Trump says he thinks the dollar is too strong while

China's yuan and Germany's euro, in particular, are too weak, giving those countries an unfair trade advantage. Yet Mr. Trump's key domestic economic proposals--and rising interest rates in the U.S.--are boosting the dollar's value. Failure to solve this contradiction could escalate global trade tensions.

""Most of his ideas point to a stronger dollar,"" he said, which will raise manufacturing costs and crimp demand for U.S. products overseas.
The Treasury Secretary tried Thursday to present a more moderate position than his boss, saying that while a strong dollar may cause the economy problems in the short term, in the long term, it is a sign of confidence in the world's currency reserve.
""What I am focused on is the long-term aspects of the currency and the importance of it as a stable reserve currency around the world,"" he said.
That is why Mr. Mnuchin will push finance ministers from China, Japan, Germany and other G-20 countries to abide by existing currency vows to not to use their exchange rates for competitive gains.
Drafting plans to sanction countries that devalue their currencies, the Trump administration repeatedly has targeted China's yuan policy, accusing the country of keeping its exchange rate artificially low and driving a $350 billion annual U.S. trade deficit with the country. And Germany's record-breaking trade surplus, the largest in the world, has put it in U.S. sights also.
""What can I as German finance minister do to reduce the surplus?"" Mr. Scha?uble said Thursday. Economically struggling eurozone countries don't make an attractive destination for investors and need to overhaul their economies, Berlin says.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi last week said it is the dollar that is overvalued, not the euro that is undervalued.
And China's premier, Li Keqiang, said Wednesday that Beijing wouldn't devalue its currency and didn't want a trade war.

HSBC,"CMO Today: Inside Politico After Split With Jim VandeHei; Here's your morning roundup of the biggest marketing, advertising and media industry news and happenings."," Mar 20, 2017",0,"
INSIDE POLITICO: It has been over a year since Politico's former CEO and co-founder, Jim VandeHei, said he was departing the beltway publisher amid growing tensions with owner Robert Allbritton. Since then, Mr. VandeHei launched rival venture Axios with $10 million in funding and support from three executives who also exited Politico along with star reporter Mike Allen. According to executives who spoke with The Wall Street Journal, Politico has withstood the upheaval . Mr. Allbritton, who is now CEO of the site, has made a conscious effort to reverse or pare back some of his predecessor's initiatives, including a push to launch versions of the site in state capitals. And he's tried to focus on things he felt had fallen through the cracks. ""If it was interesting to Jim, it would get done. If it wasn't, it didn't,"" Mr. Allbritton told the Journal. Mr.
VandeHei's backers dispute that critique and say he handed off a successful and growing company. While Politico wouldn't divulge detailed financials, subscription revenue for Politico Pro was up 30% last year and site traffic in January was nearly double that of a year ago. But advertising is still ""soft"" as businesses wait to see what sort of legislation emerges during the Trump presidency. Some Politico staffers worry Axios will become a head-to-head threat, going after their advertisers and subscribers.
GOOGLE DILEMMA: Google said it plans to offer advertisers better controls over where their content appears after major U.K. marketers said they would be pulling their spots from YouTube and the Google Display Network because their ads appeared next to offensive or extremist content. Google is reviewing its policies and planning to ask advertisers and ad agencies what additional controls they want , reports WSJ. Brands in the U.K., including HSBC, Lloyds Bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Vodafone, Sky and Barclays have pulled their ads or are considering it , reports Campaign. The British unit of ad holding company Havas made waves when it said it was suspending all advertising with Google for clients in the U.K., including Domino's Pizza and mobile firm O2. The agency said it was taking precautions to assure that the ""environment is safe, regulated to the degree necessary and additive to their brands' objectives."" Havas later said the policy was ""a temporary move made by the local team"" and didn't mean the firm was changing its use of Google globally. Not one to miss out, Martin Sorrell, CEO of the largest ad holding company WPP, told Business Insider that Google and Facebook have the same responsibility as other media companies. ""They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements.""

TICK TOCK: Chief marketing officers are under mounting pressure to reach increasingly elusive customers while investing in new technologies and digital mediums. Now, add a ticking clock. The infamously short tenure of a CMO is getting even shorter , according to a study from executive search firm Spencer Stuart. The study of CMOs from 100 of the top U.S. ad spenders found that the average tenure for marketing leaders fell to 42 months in 2016, from 44 months in 2015, reports CMO Today, the second year in a row that tenures have shrunk. ""Tough business headwinds, new technologies and pressures to change quickly"" are among the many reasons for the turnover, said Greg Welch, a consultant in Spencer Stuart's marketing officer group. ""It's the perfect storm."" Changes in the C- suite role can also have major implications for Madison Avenue, as new CMOs tend to change up a company's marketing strategy and potentially its ad agencies. The study also shows that the diversity problem in advertising exists beyond agencies. Of the marketing chiefs in the study, about 23% were women, and only 9% were African- American, Hispanic or Asian.
MARCH MADNESS: If there was ever a time for advertisers to flex their creative muscle, it would be the NCAA men's basketball tournament. Team branding, coaches, mascots and former players are all fair game for the more than $1 billion in TV ads, but the stars of the basketball tournament--the players themselves--are off limits . So what's a creative to do? According to the New York Times, LG Electronics USA is airing TV spots featuring mascots from various teams using its appliances. Buffalo Wild Wings put an actor in a Louisville uniform to resemble a player in its commercial, and Pizza Hut tapped former Duke star Grant Hill to hawk its pizza-ordering shoes. The NCAA prohibits student athletes or their likenesses from appearing in any advertising. The strict stance that has been controversial as some think the athletes deserve a slice of the dough they are raking in for CBS and Turner, while the NCAA argues it's designed to protect student athletes.

HSBC,Quick Hits: PBOC Challenges and Monetary Policy in Asia; Swiss Central Bank dials back currency intervention," Mar 20, 2017",0,"The People's Bank of China's research chief discussed challenges facing his central bank, monetary policy in Asia is seen diverging from the Federal Reserve's, and the Swiss National Bank appears to be backing off from currency intervention this month. Here are quick hits on central banking and related market views from around the world. PBOC Official Says China's Monetary Policy 'Carrying an Unbearable Weight'
China's central bank has a much more difficult job to do than many other central banks, says its research chief. ""China's monetary policy has been carrying an unbearable weight, operating in the cracks between stabilizing economic growth, preventing risks, restructuring and promoting reforms,"" says Xu Zhong in an article posted on the central bank's website. The People's Bank of China also has less authority in making policies than other central banks, says Mr. Xu. ""We have to recognize that there are boundaries to the effectiveness of monetary policy. It cannot resolve all the problems and can't replace reform,"" he says.

HSBC Sees Asian Monetary Policy Diverging From That of U.S.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is leading a global tightening cycle, but HSBC's co-head of Asia economics, Frederic Neumann, says he isn't convinced that Asian central banks will follow suit. He says China's central bank gently tapped the brakes again last week, ""but this hardly amounts to outright tightening."" The Bank of Japan also doesn't seem to be in a hurry to raise rates, with price pressures ""nailed to the floor,"" he says. ""The picture is similar elsewhere--data is looking better, but growth remains well below potential,"" he says. This means that Asian central bankers don't need to worry about inflation. ""In short, monetary policy will continue to diverge between the Fed and Asia. And that sets us up for quite a bumpy ride,"" he concludes.

Taiwan Central Bank Likely to Stand Firm on Rates: DBS
DBS expects Taiwan's central bank to hold the benchmark discount rate at 1.375% on Thursday. It maintains the view that Taiwan's economic recovery is moderate and the inflation risk is under control. The bank says the continuing recovery isn't strong enough to prompt the central bank to raise rates. Exports have surged to double- digit growth in January-February, but consumption remains lackluster and wage growth hasn't picked up, it says. ""Policy makers would like to see a broad-based and self-sustained recovery before contemplating rate hikes,"" it adds. Besides, the strength of the Taiwan currency--which has appreciated 5% versus the U.S. dollar year-to-date-- could prompt the central bank to adopt a cautious approach to interest-rate policy. This would avoid fueling short- term capital inflows, inducing further appreciation pressure, it says.

They have risen under CHF4 billion in the past two weeks, not a big change. In contrast, sight deposits rose over CHF20 billion from late January to early March.

Economists Reduce Outlook for Brazil Inflation for This Year
Economists once again reduced their outlook for Brazil inflation this year, according to a weekly central-bank survey. Brazil's inflation rate, as measured by the official consumer-price index, is expected to end 2017 at 4.15%, according to the survey of 100 economists, compared with the 4.19% rate forecast in the previous week's survey. It marked the second consecutive outlook reduction for this year. The forecast is below the central bank's 4.5% inflation target for 2017. Meanwhile, the economists maintained their inflation forecast for 2018 at 4.5%. The benchmark Selic rate is forecast to end 2017 at 9%, the same level seen in last week's survey. For 2018, economists reduced their view for the Selic rate, to 8.50% from 8.75%. The country's economic growth forecast for 2017 was maintained at 0.48%. For next year, those surveyed expect the economy to grow 2.50%, compared with 2.40% forecast a week ago.

Bond Market Starts Pricing In ECB Deposit Rate Increase
The bond market is starting to show expectations of an increase in the European Central Bank's deposit rate over the next 18 months, according to fixed-income strategists at Deutsche Bank. They say the market is pricing in a 10-basis-point rise by January 2018, a 15-basis-point rise by May 18 and a 20-basis-point rise by August 2018. The ECB's deposit rate currently stands at minus 0.4%. The sequencing of the ECB's easing decisions since the start of quantitative easing indicates that a deposit rate rise is likely, but could be a communication challenge for the central bank, they add. Market pricing points to the deposit rate being raised before the main refinancing rate. Tasos Vossos
ECB Speculation Can't Break Through Bund Yield Resistance
The European Central Bank seems unable to curb speculation regarding rate increases so long as macroeconomic data are resilient, but Commerzbank analysts are still reluctant to turn more bearish on 10-year German government bonds. One reason is ""hard resistance"" at around 0.5%, with bund yields failing to rise sustainably above this level earlier this month. A similar foray in late January also failed. Yields rise as bond prices drop. Commerzbank recommends tactical long positions in bunds Monday.
Tasos Vossos
ECB Rate Rise Before QE End Seen Tail Risk
The possibility of the European Central Bank raising interest rates before its quantitative-easing program ends is a tail risk, says Morgan Stanley. And even if this happens, ""it's highly unlikely the ECB can go with a full blown 25 basis points hike."" It points out that the last four ECB rate cuts have been by 10 basis points, while underlying inflation pressure remains subdued. Morgan Stanley believes if rates were to rise, then a 10-basis-point increase would be more likely, ""although still an unlikely scenario."" It would be a very dovish hike, with a slow path for rate increases thereafter, it says.

HSBC,What It Takes for Banks to Nab a Criminal; Shareholders bear the costs of banks failing to spot financial crime," Mar 21, 2017",1,"
Banking isn't really about moving money around: In truth it is an information processing business. On that score, information overload continues to dog the banks.
Danske Bank, HSBC, Nordea and Royal Bank of Scotland are the latest to be caught up in allegations of a $20 billion Russian money-laundering operation, reported in European and Asian media. The banks all said they were committed to combating financial crime.
What banks do all day is send and receive millions of messages, deposit records and settlement confirmations. Spotting the transactions of money launderers , terrorists and rogue states has become more complex in the digital age where data are greater in volume and travel further and faster and to more obscure places.
Some banks have been guilty of helping clients to do bad things like avoid tax or get around sanctions. Many have unwittingly been used by bad people. All must invest time and resources into improving their systems and controls to try to stop this.
Shareholders bear the costs for failure as shown by fines paid recently by Deutsche Bank in a Russian equity trading scandal and by HSBC related to money laundering in Mexico in 2012.
But each individual bank only sees part of what is happening across the network. More cooperation on sharing and analysis of banking information is required. While the Financial Stability Board helps regulators manage systemic risks across borders, the Financial Action Task Force only sets standards and encourages governments to implement them.
One problem is that data aren't always standardized or processed in the same way, which makes them harder to use. The financial crisis sparked lots of work to improve the collection and utility of banking information. For example, when Lehman Brothers collapsed many institutions had no idea they were even exposed to a Lehman subsidiary. The U.S. Office of Financial Research has since led the creation of a global barcode-like system of Legal Entity Identifiers to help banks and regulators understand who is who.
With better, more standard data, regulators and central banks can build more sophisticated tools for analysis of financial networks that will help identify the paths of payments across the whole system. The suspicious ones that travel furthest, make the most leaps between institutions or move in circles can then become easier to spot.
This also entails proper identification of offshore companies and other structures, an approach that might impinge on the privacy of celebrities or the superrich, but which, like security cameras throughout our cities, seems a small price to pay if people aren't doing anything wrong.
Current methods for identifying suspicious activity are still crude and throw up too many false or incomplete signals. The work to improve this is little different from the work to identify and combat systemic risks. Banks and global regulators should redouble their efforts to build better defenses.

HSBC,Google Steps Up Effort to Keep Ads Away From Controversial Content; Alphabet unit acts after backlash over ads displayed next to fake news or terrorist videos; targets include content that attacks or harasses," Mar 21, 2017",1,"Google unveiled changes to its ad policies and enforcement Tuesday, saying it would pull more advertising from controversial content and give advertisers more control and visibility over where their ads appear.
The steps come in response to an advertiser backlash over recent reports that the Alphabet Inc. unit frequently displays ads next to inappropriate content such as fabricated news stories or terrorist videos.
The company also said it would employ more people and technology to enforce the new policies.
""We know advertisers don't want their ads next to content that doesn't align with their values,"" Google Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said in a blog post Tuesday. ""So starting today, we're taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content.""
Major advertisers such as HSBC Holdings PLC and L'Ore?al SA reduced spending with Google in recent days after news reports that Google regularly served their ads on controversial websites or YouTube videos, including some made by supporters of terrorist groups such as Islamic State and a violent pro-Nazi group.
Google had long said existing controls guard against marketers' spots appearing alongside controversial content. But after the advertiser pushback in the U.K., Google on Friday and again Monday acknowledged that those measure fell short, and vowed to improve .
The speed with which Google announced the measures suggests the tools were already at its disposal. Yet enforcing the new policies could be tricky. Google must screen a sea of content that every day adds thousands of websites and nearly 600,000 hours of new YouTube footage. And while some controversial content, such as pornography or neo-Nazi sites, clearly violates its standards for advertising, other cases are nuanced and require human review.
Google's announcement ""is a first step. But, importantly, it doesn't just end here,"" said Max Kalehoff, chief marketing officer of SocialCode, which helps market brands on social networks including YouTube.
Advertising on the internet involves a complex system that automatically places ads in front of targeted audiences wherever they are on the web, he said. ""The notion of context is a moving target. We're not talking about linear TV
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 428 of 1177
where you had a spoon-fed, tightly controlled stream of content to a mass audience,"" he added.
Google has long aimed to position itself as a neutral platform connecting advertisers with vast amounts of content on the internet created by others, including millions of videos on its YouTube site and more than 2 million websites served by its ad-distribution business. That approach has been lucrative for Google as it has monetized far ends of the internet--with sometimes edgy content--while also giving marketers a broader reach for their ads.
But with spending on digital ads surpassing that on television ads last year in the U.S., according to eMarketer, increasing scrutiny from advertisers is forcing internet companies like Google and Facebook Inc. to take more responsibility for the content on which they serve ads.
Google, in effect, is becoming a reluctant policeman for the internet.
The British unit of Volkswagen AG's Audi, which had pulled its YouTube ads, said Tuesday that it welcomes ""the swift action Google is taking to address these concerns,"" and ""once we have a committed time frame from Google clarifying when these safeguards will be implemented across the board, we will have a closer discussion with the brand and fully assess our position in the U.K.""
Rob Norman, chief digital officer of the ad-buying unit of ad company WPP, said that a handful of his clients suspended advertising on YouTube in the U.K. and that his group has pressured Google to improve controls for advertisers. ""As with traditional media owners, Google and other digital platforms should take responsibility for their content,"" said WPP Chief Executive Martin Sorrell.
Ad spending affected so far is relatively small, but the attention to the issue prompted Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser to downgrade Alphabet's stock to hold from buy.
""We think that awareness of the incident will marginally curtail global growth this year vs. prior expectations,"" Mr. Wieser wrote in a research note Monday.
Serving ads on third-party websites earned Google for $15.6 billion last year, or 17.3% of Alphabet's overall revenue. YouTube revenue is unclear.
As part of the changes, Google plans to expand a policy that prohibits ads from running alongside content that attacks or harasses people based on their race, religion, gender or similar categories. Current policy focuses on content that advocates violence toward such groups; the new policy applies to any content that is incendiary or demeaning to such people. That change is likely to be among the most controversial with website owners and YouTube video creators who rely on Google for ad revenues, as its broad scope could include a wide variety of content.
The company also said it would place ads only on the YouTube videos of ""legitimate creators"" and pull ads from the videos of those that ""impersonate other channels or violate our community guidelines."" Google also is reviewing its policies to determine whether more YouTube videos should be removed from the site.
Google is changing the default settings for ads to limit them to more mainstream sites and videos, requiring brands to opt in to advertising on broader--and sometimes edgier--types of content such as such as videos peddling extremist views, conspiracy theories or misinformation. Google said it would simplify how advertisers control where their ads appear, including giving advertisers the ability to blacklist specific sites or YouTube videos. Google said it would give advertisers more transparency on where their ads appear, though Mr. Schindler's post specifically mentioned only the expansion to all advertisers of an existing tool that tells brands every YouTube video on which their ads ran. Google said it also plans to hire significant numbers of people and develop technology ""to increase our capacity to review questionable content."" And the company plans to make it easier for advertisers to flag issues, with the goal of resolving problem cases within two hours, a person familiar with the matter said.
A Google spokeswoman said the policies would take effect ""in the coming weeks.""

* Google to Simplify YouTube Advertiser Controls (March 20)"
HSBC,Google Steps Up Effort to Keep Ads Away From Controversial Content; Alphabet unit acts after backlash over ads displayed next to fake news or terrorist videos; targets include content that attacks or harasses," Mar 22, 2017",1,"Google sought to tamp down a growing controversy over its placement of ads on inappropriate content with a promise to better police the millions of websites and videos across its platforms.
The company has faced a powerful backlash from advertisers over the past several days. HSBC Holdings PLC and L'Ore?al SA reduced spending with the technology giant after news reports that Google regularly placed their ads on controversial websites or YouTube videos, including some made by supporters of terrorist groups such as Islamic State and a violent pro-Nazi faction.
Google and other internet giants such as Facebook Inc. have long aimed to position themselves as neutral platforms connecting users and advertisers with content created by others. That approach helped Google build the world's largest advertising business, in part by selling ads on far ends of the internet with sometimes edgy content. But with estimates showing spending on digital ads surpassing that on television ads last year in the U.S., increasing scrutiny from advertisers is forcing internet companies to take more responsibility for the content on which they run ads.
Under policies unveiled Tuesday, Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., said it would pull more advertising from controversial websites and videos and give marketers more control and visibility over where their ads appear. Google also said it would employ more people and technology to enforce the policies.
""We know advertisers don't want their ads next to content that doesn't align with their values,"" Google Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said in a blog post Tuesday. ""So starting today, we're taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content.""
Google had long said existing controls guard against marketers' spots appearing alongside controversial content. The speed with which Google announced the additional measures--following an apology on Friday--suggests the tools were already at its disposal. Google said Tuesday the changes would roll out gradually.
Yet enforcing the new policies could be tricky. Google must screen a sea of content that every day adds thousands of websites and nearly 600,000 hours of new YouTube footage. And while some controversial content, such as pornography or neo-Nazi sites, clearly violates its standards for advertising, other cases are nuanced and require human review.
""The reason Google has been reluctant on how to address this is because they can't fully address it,"" said David Rodnitzky, head of ad agency 3Q Digital. ""They can build algorithms to find a hate group or article a brand doesn't
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 431 of 1177
want to be associated with, but at end of the day, the internet is a vast, sprawling, ever-changing ecosystem that is impossible to ever solve with an algorithm.""
Google already employs thousands of people to stop violations of its existing ad policies. So Mr. Rodnitzky said he believes Tuesday's changes are ""window dressing to placate big advertisers.""
The British unit of Volkswagen AG's Audi, which had pulled its YouTube ads, said it welcomed Google's ""swift action"" to address concerns, but was awaiting clarity. ""Once we have a committed time frame from Google clarifying when these safeguards will be implemented across the board, we will have a closer discussion with the brand and fully assess our position in the U.K.,"" the auto maker said.
WPP said that a handful of its clients suspended advertising on YouTube in the U.K. and that the ad firm pressured Google to improve controls for advertisers. ""As with traditional media owners, Google and other digital platforms should take responsibility for their content,"" said WPP Chief Executive Martin Sorrell.
Spending affected so far is relatively small, and touches a subset of Google's business. Serving ads on third-party websites brought in revenue of $15.6 billion last year, or 17.3% of Alphabet's overall revenue. Alphabet doesn't disclose YouTube's revenue.
But the issue prompted Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser on Monday to downgrade Alphabet's stock to hold from buy. He said Tuesday that the announced measures were too late. ""Brand safety has become one of the most important issues in the minds of a typical large marketer,"" he said, so he predicted ad spending on Google to fall slightly as a result of the controversy.
The planned changes at Google include expanding a policy that prohibits ads from running alongside content that attacks or harasses people based on race, religion, gender or similar categories.
While current policy focuses on content that advocates violence toward such groups, the new one applies to anything that is incendiary or demeaning to them. That change likely will be controversial with some website owners and video creators who rely on Google for ad revenues, as its broad scope could include a wide variety of content.

HSBC,Yen Hits Four-Month High as Skepticism Grows Over Trump Policies; Dollar weakens on greater skepticism among investors about U.S. President Donald Trump's ability to stimulate the economy," Mar 22, 2017",0,"TOKYO--The Japanese yen rose to its highest level in four months against the dollar on Wednesday in Asia, prompted by greater skepticism among investors about whether President Donald Trump will be able to stimulate the U.S. economy.
The potential for trade friction following a weekend meeting among the Group of 20 industrialized and developing nations also clouded the global economic outlook and boosted the appeal of the yen, a safe-haven asset in times of economic uncertainty. At the request of the U.S., finance ministers in the G-20 dropped a longstanding clause criticizing protectionism .
The yen rose against the U.S. dollar in the hours immediately after Mr. Trump's election victory, then fell sharply on expectations for an economic-stimulus policy in the Trump administration. The president has promised to introduce tax cuts and spur $1 trillion in spending on U.S. infrastructure construction , but he hasn't outlined a detailed plan.
Expectations for the changes began to weaken after Mr. Trump struggled to round up support for a health-care bill headed for a vote this week in the Republican-led House.
""If he stumbles here, what's going to happen going forward?"" said Katsunori Kitakura, strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank. ""Markets are becoming jittery because there haven't been any substantive achievements.""
In trading late afternoon Wednesday Tokyo time, the dollar fell as low as ¥111.13, the lowest level since Nov. 23, compared with ¥111.73 late Tuesday in New York, according to EBS. The euro briefly fell to a three-week low of ¥119.80 in Tokyo, compared with ¥120.77 in late New York trading.
Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso on Wednesday said Tokyo should maintain close communication with the U.S. and continue its efforts to keep the yen stable. ""Excessive sharp movements, up or down, could have a considerable impact on the economy,"" Mr. Aso said in Parliament. He brushed aside speculation Washington might pressure Tokyo to guide the yen higher.
Kenji Yoshii, foreign-exchange strategist at Mizuho Securities, said any failure to move ahead on the health bill may cause ""further unwinding of the Trump trade.""
The dollar was around ¥105 before the U.S. election.
Kosuke Hanao, head of foreign exchange at HSBC in Tokyo, said some investors were taking profits ahead of the quarter's end March 31 because of uncertainty over the health bill.
Until recently, the widening interest-rate gap between the U.S. and Japan was supporting the dollar. The Federal Reserve has been raising rates while Japan's central bank has been keeping the yield on 10-year government bonds close to zero. However, when the Fed raised its benchmark rate last week, its projections for further tightening disappointed some investors who had bet on a faster tightening pace. That led to drops in Treasury yields and some dollar selling.

Republicans' CFPB Long Game Comes Into Focus
A House Financial Services Committee hearing on Tuesday put on display the many moving parts of the debate over the future of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as a path forward for congressional Republicans.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the clearest distillation of the possible Republican strategy was laid out by Ted Olson, the former solicitor general under President George W. Bush who represents the mortgage company PHH Corp. in its case against the CFPB. ""Restore the president's power to control subordinates and restore Congress's control of the purse,"" he recommended.
Congressional Republicans have, for now, backed off their plan to transform the CFPB's structure from a single director to a five-member commission. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) plans to remove the commission idea from his revised Financial Choice Act , according to a memo circulated
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 436 of 1177
among committee members and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
That is largely because time is on the Republicans' side. Even if the federal appeals court handling the case doesn't rule until sometime next year, or if it rules in favor of keeping the CFPB's structure, Director Richard Cordray's term will still expire in July of 2018, allowing President Donald Trump to appoint his own director.
Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress can pursue the second prong of Mr. Olson's suggested strategy by putting the CFPB under the congressional appropriations process.
Currently, the CFPB is funded by the Federal Reserve and isn't subject to annual appropriations from Congress. Democrats, while writing the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, included the provision to try to protect the bureau from being gutted by Republicans who opposed it.
Those fears could now come to pass. Republicans would need only 51 votes in the Senate to pass changes to the CFPB's funding structure. If a Republican Congress controlled the CFPB's funding, they could drastically shrink the bureau's budget for rule making, supervision and enforcement, unwinding consumer protection functions introduced after the financial crisis.
The appropriations process also would afford Republicans leverage for negotiations with Democrats, who would be eager to preserve as much of the CFPB's functions as they can. For instance, would they be open to a bipartisan commission structure if it meant preserving funding for key aspects of the bureau's mission?
Time will tell, but it is unlikely Democrats would be willing to watch one of President Barack Obama's signature accomplishments wither just to protect the single-director structure. Especially if that director ultimately is a Trump appointee.
The range of possible outcomes for the CFPB is still only beginning to come into view. Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

HSBC,"AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon Pull Ads From Google Over 'Hate' Videos; Carriers also aim to compete with Google for ad dollars"," Mar 22, 2017",1,"AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. on Wednesday joined a growing number of companies pulling much of their advertising from Google, expanding a controversy over the internet giant's ad placements on objectionable content and deepening the financial impact on the company even after it announced measures to assuage concerns.
The new moves by advertisers amplify a problem for Google that had been centered in the U.K., and suggests the Alphabet Inc. unit is finding it harder than expected to quell the backlash. The crisis has created an opening for some advertisers to press Google for long-sought changes, while highlighting its complicated relationship with some of its customers. AT&T and Verizon, for example, in addition to being big advertisers, are building online video and ad services to compete with Google.
The two wireless carriers and pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline PLC suspended advertising spending on Google except for search, encompassing all ads on Google's YouTube site and the more than two million third- party websites in Google's advertising network. Johnson &Johnson and rental-car firm Enterprise Holdings Inc. said they were canceling advertising on YouTube. Distiller Beam Suntory Inc. said it also canceled some advertising with Google.
The companies said the suspensions were in response to evidence that Google placed their ads on extremist YouTube videos.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 442 of 1177
""We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,"" AT&T said in a statement, adding that its move would last ""until Google can ensure this won't happen again."" AT&T declined to disclose how much it spends on YouTube, but a person familiar with the matter said AT&T is among the video site's top customers.
On Tuesday, Google unveiled changes to its policies and enforcement designed to keep ads away from controversial sites and videos, after brands such as the British newspaper the Guardian, HSBC Holdings PLC and L'Ore?al SA reduced their ad dollars within the past week.
Verizon said in a statement that it is working with digital-ad partners ""to understand the weak links so we can prevent this from happening in the future."" Verizon's suspension applies to all so-called programmatic advertising, which uses software to automatically place ads across the web. Such advertising includes ads on YouTube and Google's network of third-party sites.
A Google spokeswoman said it is working on measures ""to further safeguard our advertisers' brands."" She declined to comment on specific companies.
For Google, the world's largest advertising platform, the uproar has spiraled from a public-relations issue into a crisis that some analysts say could hit its bottom line. Serving ads on third-party websites brought in revenue of $15.6 billion last year, or 17.3% of Alphabet's overall revenue. Alphabet doesn't disclose YouTube's revenue, but has signaled it has been a major driver of growth in recent quarters. The controversy hasn't touched the company's main moneymaker, ads atop search results.
""This probably gets worse before it gets better for Google,"" said Brian Wieser, Pivotal Research Group analyst, who downgraded Alphabet's stock to hold from buy on Monday because of advertisers' reactiony.
Google's recent policy changes ""did nothing to alleviate concerns.""
The advertising backlash began in the U.K. following a report in the Times of London about videos made by supporters of terrorist groups. Subsequently, it was found that many American brands continued to be shown alongside controversial clips, prompting the wave of ad cancellations Wednesday.
Some of the loudest voices stoking Google's controversy are companies with axes to grind with the tech giant: telecom companies that view themselves as rivals of Google in online advertising, publishers and media companies that have watched Google suck up ad dollars, and marketers that do battle regularly with Google and see a chance in the crisis to push for changes.
""We've been talking about brand safety for 20 years. It's not a new phenomenon,"" said David Cohen, president of Interpublic Group of Cos Inc. ad-buying group Magna Global in North America. ""We're exerting pressure to do more.""
In the past several days, executives at the biggest media-buying agencies have been fielding calls from marketers eager to find out more about whether their own ads have landed in foul places, not just in the U.K. but world-wide. Meanwhile, a global beverage company has pulled most of its ad spending from Google, outside of search, in 30 countries including the U.S., according to a person familiar with the situation. In a few smaller markets, the beverage giant will continue to buy inventory from ""Google Preferred,"" which are top YouTube channels that Google markets as some of the site's most brand-friendly content, the person said.
Agency executives have been in talks with Google to press for more details on the new tools it will provide. Industry executives have long called on Google to give them greater control over where their ads appear, and more visibility into its ad systems. But they feel the high-profile nature of the current flare-up gives them a strong change to make that case.
Mr. Cohen said Interpublic is asking for more specifics about the brand-safety measures Google said it would implement, and that it wants Google to be more accessible to third-party companies that verify the safety of web- ad inventory on behalf of brands.
Havas SA, the world's sixth-largest ad-agency holding company by revenue, last week pulled ads for its clients in the U.K. off Google properties. Yannick Bollore, Havas's chief executive, said the ad firm is working with some marketers to explore if they should be removing ads everywhere in the world, not just in the U.K. ""Right now it is
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 443 of 1177

only discussions. I will know more in a couple of days,"" he said.
As for why Havas hasn't already suspended advertising on Google properties in other countries, Mr. Yannick said, ""we had proof that it happened in the U.K., and I haven't received any proof that it happened in other markets."" Verizon has built up an online advertising business with the acquisition of AOL in 2015 and has struck a deal to acquire Yahoo Inc.'s core business. The combination would give Verizon roughly 2% of the global digital advertising market in 2016, according to eMarketer.
Like Google, AOL sells advertising that is automatically distributed to third-party sites. AT&T, meanwhile, is positioning itself as a budding competitor to Google as an advertising platform, pitching its proposed merger with Time Warner Inc. as a defense against Google's growing power in the industry.
""Advertisers need more competition,"" Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said on an October conference call with analysts.

HSBC,"How a 'Low Volatility' Stock Plunged 85% in an Hour; China Huishan Dairy lost $4 billion in value in a flash, after being among the most stable stocks in the world the past 18 months"," Mar 24, 2017",1,"
Reading the label isn't enough for picking funds . You may need to go into the ingredients list, too.
Take a look at funds that track the MSCI Minimum Volatility Emerging Markets Index. On Friday a constituent stock fell 85%--in one hour, about as volatile as you can get. China Huishan Dairy, which had a weighting of around 0.7% in the index before the crash, lost more than $4 billion in market value. Since the company is in other MSCI indices, there are many funds that hold the stock. BlackRock, for example, owns around 1.3% of the company, according to FactSet.
The company halted trading in its shares just after the plunge. But there were hints all along this low-vol play was anything but.
One worry sign was the quarter of the company's shares pledged by its largest shareholder and chairman, Yang Kai, to a bank in return for a loan in December. When a bank fears that it may not recover the full value of share loan, it may choose to dump the shares in the market, as happened with other Hong Kong stock plungers , notably, Tech Pro Technology and Hanergy Thin Film Power. Huishan itself has also racked up mounds of debt, including by using its cows as collateral.
A gaggle of Wall Street banks, including Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Goldman Sachs and UBS, brought Huishan Dairy to market in 2013 , selling it as well placed to benefit from rising Chinese consumption. The stock quickly slid far

below its IPO price. Mr. Yang then began systematically buying shares , helping the price recover. It traded at a remarkably narrow range over the past 18 months, giving it an eerie impression of stability.
Low volatility is great while it lasts.

HSBC,U.K. Banks Need to Show They Can Withstand a Pound Crisis; The Bank of England's stress test for banks envisions the worst Brexit risk: a collapse in confidence in the pound," Mar 27, 2017",1,"
There is little mention of Brexit in the conditions laid out Monday for the Bank of England's next stress test. But lenders are going to see how they hold up against the worst risk in Britain cutting ties with Europe: a pound crisis. In the test, sterling collapses to just $0.85, far below FactSet's record low of $1.04 in 1985, while the Bank of England lifts interest rates to 4% and 10-year bond yields spike to 6.9% in the first quarter of 2018 from 1.18% now. Such a sharp rise in rates will put a huge strain on over indebted consumers' and also bring big losses on banks' holdings of U.K. government and corporate bonds. For investors, it should give a clear view of the risks in U.K. lenders' recent rush into unsecured consumer lending, which kept the U.K. economy humming since the Brexit vote.
This will be a real test for Barclays , which has a leading U.K. credit card business, and Lloyds Banking Group, which just paid £1.9 billion ($2.4 billion) for a large U.K. card business from Bank of America. The U.K.'s Asia focused banks HSBC and Standard Chartered will be less troubled by this, but the stress test incorporates a big drop in Chinese GDP for them to worry about.
The pound has lost more than 15% against the dollar since last summer's vote, but crucially there has been no serious flight from U.K. assets by foreign investors. A real crisis for the pound would make it harder for the U.K. to finance its deep current-account deficit .
That would have more painful economic consequences, particularly for consumer credit defaults, which often cause the largest losses for banks because people default on these before car or home loans and there is no collateral.
All consumer credit was growing at its fastest pace since 2005 late last year and policy makers are worried that lending standards are slipping. The Bank of England is separately conducting a review of standards.
The review and the test combined send a strong signal that regulators will act to curb consumer lending if they decide it is getting out of hand. The test results in late 2017 will show how worried investors ought to be.

HSBC,The North Korea Sanctions Myth; The U.S. hasn't nearly maxed out its options--assuming it's willing to target offenders in China.," Mar 27, 2017",0,"To hear some in Washington tell it, the Trump administration's plans to intensify sanctions on North Korea are more of the same--the continuation of a decades-old effort that hasn't stopped Pyongyang's nuclear program. This criticism is ill-informed. The U.S. has never stuck with a North Korea sanctions policy worth the name, and the Trump team is right to recognize the need to start.
The myth of maxed-out sanctions has been around for years. Former U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen cited it last week in Beijing, saying ""There are no good options that are available right now. We've tried them all.""
It's correct that U.S. policy has seen a string of failures since 1994, when the Clinton administration offered fuel and other U.S. aid in exchange for North Korean promises to denuclearize. Since 1998 U.S. laws have imposed gradually more sanctions, as have seven United Nations Security Council resolutions since 2006, all adding to the impression that North Korea is truly squeezed. In 2015 President Obama called it the ""most sanctioned"" nation on earth.
In fact North Korea may not even have been in the top five, as Iran, Syria, Burma, Zimbabwe and Belarus faced tougher sanctions.
That began to change only last year, after Pyongyang's fourth nuclear test, with the passage of the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act pushed by Rep. Ed Royce and Sen. Cory Gardner. Among other virtues, the law mandated secondary sanctions on the foreign (mostly Chinese) entities that link Pyongyang to the global economy.
This forced Mr. Obama's hand--to a point. Last June, as a Congressional deadline loomed, the Treasury Department designated North Korea a ""primary money-laundering concern"" under the Patriot Act. This is the strongest financial sanction, allowing U.S. officials to deny dollar access to any financial institution working with North Korea. Burma and Iran were blacklisted this way years before, and finally it was North Korea's turn.
Since June any Chinese or other institution serving North Korea has risked the fate of Banco Delta Asia, the Macau-based outfit blacklisted by the U.S. in 2005 for alleged Pyongyang money-laundering. That move caused a cascade of other banks to halt North Korea business for fear of similarly losing access to U.S. dollars. One North Korean official told a U.S. counterpart, ""You finally found a way to hurt us.""
But the Bush administration backed down in 2007 in exchange for more empty nuclear promises, and Mr. Obama refused to revive the model. The Obama administration last year imposed financial sanctions on only one Chinese entity, the Dandong Hongxiang trading company, which allegedly laundered money for Pyongyang.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 449 of 1177
Hence President Trump's opportunity. A U.N. report last year tied dozens of Chinese firms to blacklisted North Korean entities and cited Bank of China for allegedly helping a North Korea-linked client move $40 million deceptively through U.S. banks. The same U.N. panel this month showed how North Korea's military acquired missile components via Chinese firms, while a North Korean businessman tried to use the country's Beijing embassy to trade a lithium metal used in miniaturized nuclear warheads.
In punishing Dandong Hongxiang for alleged money laundering, the Obama administration seized assets from 12 Chinese banks--yet accused none of wrongdoing. European banks HSBC and BNP Paribas, which paid U.S. penalties of almost $11 billion for various sanctions violations in recent years, wish they had been so lucky.
In a periodic review last week, the U.S. sanctioned 12 Chinese individuals and entities for unspecified violations under the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act, meaning they can't sign contracts with the U.S. government or buy items subject to U.S. export controls. This is good as far as it goes, but shady Chinese arms dealers don't survive on U.S. government contracts. A true assault on North Korea's financial enablers will require more aggressive restrictions on a wider range of Chinese banks, trading companies, shipping lines and other entities.
China would protest such U.S. sanctions, but the alternatives are grave. One is capitulating to Pyongyang and risking the consequences, including possible attacks across the Pacific and a nuclear South Korea and Japan. Another is moving toward military strikes. Beijing always promotes a third way, advertising itself as a partner for limited pressure such as its ostensible recent suspension of North Korean coal imports. But these are far outweighed by China's economic and diplomatic support for the North.
Pyongyang, for its part, says bring it on. ""Even prohibition of the international transactions system, the global financial system . . . will not frighten us or make any difference,"" diplomat Choe Myong Nam said last week in Geneva. His case rested partly on the claim that North Korea has faced sanctions for ""half a century"" and survived-- mythology that many in the U.S. apparently believe, too. Mr. Trump can show that the U.S. sanctions arsenal remains far more potent than the myth suggests.

HSBC,Blackstone's Take: Czech Central Bank to Step Out of the Shadows; The Czech National Bank will soon be one of the world's more interesting central banks. But not quite yet.," Mar 28, 2017",0,"The Czech National Bank will soon be one of the world's more interesting central banks. But not quite yet.
The CNB has signaled it will drop its target for the value of its currency, the koruna, against the euro in the next few months. In place since 2013, the policy calls for the CNB to keep the koruna at around 27 to the euro to stabilize inflation. The exchange rate target was introduced to fend off deflation, since an overly strong koruna would have pushed down on prices of imported goods and services.
But as in other parts of Europe, the threat of deflation has eased over recent months, and the rate of inflation stood
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 451 of 1177
at 2.6% in February, up from 0.5% a year earlier.
At its last policy meeting in early February, the CNB wrote: ""The Bank Board therefore states again that the Czech National Bank will not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before"" the second quarter of this year. It added: ""the Bank Board still considers it likely that the commitment will be discontinued around the middle of 2017.""
Since Thursday is the penultimate day of the first quarter, any move to drop the peg seems unlikely. The bank is also expected to keep its policy rate unchanged at 0.05%.
But things will get interesting soon after.
""We assume CNB might also want to drop the soft commitment for the most likely timing for the floor removal around mid-2017. At this stage this sounds too much like a preannouncing of the actual decision which we do not believe is the intention of the policy makers,"" wrote HSBC economist Agata Urbanska-Giner, in a research note. She sees the CNB's May 4 meeting as the likeliest time to drop the target, when it will also publish new economic forecasts.
By already pre-announcing the move, Czech officials might limit currency gyrations once the target is abandoned. The central bank has already spent vast amounts to buy euros in an effort to keep the koruna near the current target.
It is taking a different strategy from another non-eurozone country, Switzerland, which in January 2015 shocked markets by abandoning its franc ceiling with no warning, leading to a sharp rise in the franc .
But the uncertainty that looms next quarter over the timing and consequences of the currency target decision underscores a common challenge for the Swiss, Czechs, Swedes and Danes whose economies are outside the eurozone but whose central banks are heavily dependent on what the European Central Bank does.
The Czech economy isn't typically associated with safe-haven status, and hasn't had to take drastic steps like negative interest rates to weaken its currency as these others have.
But it has emerged as one of central and eastern Europe's most stable economies. And it could soon feel some of the unintended, and complicated, consequences of what it is like to be a safe haven.

HSBC,Whatever Happened to Free Trade? Companies and countries are scrambling to adjust to a strange new world created by a decade of economic retrenchment and an upswing in populism," Mar 29, 2017",1,"
After World War II, the global economy rose on a wave of trade and finance, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in developing countries and providing rich countries with cheaper goods, lucrative investments and
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 453 of 1177
hopes for a more peaceful planet.
That tide is now receding.
Nine years after the financial crisis, global trade is barely growing when compared with overall economic output. Cross-border bank lending is down sharply, as are international capital flows. Immigration in the U.S. and Western Europe faces a deepening public backlash.
Nationalist politicians are on the ascent. On Wednesday, the U.K. formally started proceedings to remove itself from the European Union. In the U.S., President Donald Trump pulled out of a Pacific trade pact on his first working day in the Oval Office, declaring, ""Great thing for the American worker, what we just did.""
For traditional economists, globalization is a pathway to prosperity. Rooted in the works of Adam Smith in 1776 and David Ricardo in 1817, the classical canon has embraced the idea that trade is the basis of wealth, because it makes nations more efficient by allowing each to specialize at what its workers do best.
Few of them fully grasped globalization's downsides in a modern economy. Tying together disparate nations economically also expanded the labor pool globally, pitting workers in wealthy nations against poorly paid ones in developing nations. That greatly boosted the fortunes of the world's poor, but also created a backlash in the U.S. and Europe. At the same time, freeing financial flows led to debilitating financial excesses that ended in crisis. ""Globalization is in retreat,"" Larry Fink, the chief executive of the big investment firm BlackRock Inc., said in a February memo to employees, outlining a new corporate strategy. ""We need to be German in Germany, Japanese in Japan and Mexican in Mexico.""
An earlier era of globalization, which stretched from 1870 to 1913, ended when the world descended into war. Rising trade barriers later played a role in the Great Depression of the 1930s. The present era may not turn out as catastrophically, but nations, companies, multilateral institutions and ordinary citizens are already scrambling to adapt to a world with bigger barriers to trade and finance as blowback builds.
Big banks, such as Citigroup and HSBC, have reduced their global footprints. Industrial firms like General Electric are developing strategies for a more localized world. Guardians of globalization, like the World Trade Organization, struggle with challenges from China and other emerging powers. Poor nations are finding it harder to count on exports for economic development. Wealthy nations face less hospitable overseas markets, while their workers grapple with the demands of automated workplaces.
Critics of globalization say a slowdown in cross-border trade and finance will help ease pressure on wages of unskilled workers in wealthy nations, stem the threat of financial bubbles and reduce the influence of multinational companies in developing nations.
""Maybe the U.S. will supply more of its demand by itself,"" said Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington, D.C., who has long urged the U.S. adopt more aggressive trade policies. ""That could be a good thing and create jobs.""
During the globalization epoch that started after World War II, trade growth usually far outpaced--and helped drive-- overall economic output. Now it is barely keeping up. The slowdown has long outlasted the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009, which helped set it off. Between 2011 and 2015, the value of global merchandise exports contracted 10%, according to the WTO, the largest drop over a four-year period in post-World War II history, driven in part by tumbling commodities prices. Merchandise export growth over a 10-year time frame is also the slowest of this era. ""We have a deflationary mind-set,"" Jakob Stausholm, chief financial officer of Maersk, the Danish shipping giant, told investors in February, while reporting a $1.9 billion loss. A few days earlier a court in Seoul declared that Hanjin Shipping Co., the world's seventh-largest shipper, was heading for liquidation.
Among the hottest trends in the industry last year was the dismantling of giant container ships for scrap metal-- 862 in all--along the beaching yards of Pakistan, Bangladesh and India.
Annual movement of capital across borders--in the form of stock and bond purchases, foreign direct investment and lending--fell more than two-thirds, to $3.3 trillion in 2015 from $11.9 trillion in 2007, according to McKinsey &Co. Overseas bank lending, particularly from Europe, has been hard hit. The stock of cross-border loans held at banks around the world contracted 21%, from $35.5 trillion in 2008 to $28.2 trillion in the third quarter of 2016,
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 454 of 1177

according to the Bank for International Settlements.
Peterson Institute for International Economics trade economist Gary Hufbauer calculates that U.S. output in 2016 was $2 trillion greater than it otherwise would have been thanks to greater trade and financial integration since 1950. Slowing the pace of globalization will actually slow U.S. income gains, he argues.
No less is at stake for a country such as Ethiopia, which has averaged growth rates in excess of 10% for the past decade as part of a push toward industrialization and greater international exposure. The country has little to fall back on if its globalization bet sours.
Hoping to emulate China's ride on the globalization wave, Ethiopia is building a half-dozen manufacturing zones to produce garments, textiles and shoes for multinational firms, along with railroads and power plants. The construction spree, which keeps the air in Addis Ababa thick with dust, has created rising external debt loads, which jumped from $2.3 billion in 2006 to $20.4 billion in 2015, according to the World Bank.
Ethiopia's prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, says the debt is a price he is willing to pay. ""If you want to move in an easy way, then you can't achieve double-digit growth,"" he said in a recent interview. ""We have to carefully manage it, but there is a way out also. We have a huge potential in terms of exports.""
The lethargic recovery from the global recession, especially weak demand for capital goods and big investment projects, helps to explain the global trade slowdown.
Protectionism is another cause. Global Trade Alert, a trade monitoring group, counts nearly 7,000 protectionist measures enacted world-wide since the recession of 2009. About half of the items are aimed at China.
It has been 23 years since the completion of the last global trade deal in 1994 and no other is on the horizon. Since 2008, the International Monetary Fund reports, tariff reductions have been ""minimal,"" after falling by about 1 percentage point a year between 1986 and 1995 and 0.5 percentage points annually for the following 13 years. Multinational companies used the 1990s and 2000s to build global supply chains--for instance linking rubber plantations in Malaysia to tire manufacturers in China and retailers in the U.S., or coffee growers in Colombia to Starbucks restaurants.
These webs of commerce supercharged trade but have begun to retrench, as companies localize their production and import fewer components for assembly. The World Bank says global supply chains stopped growing around 2011, after expanding about 4% annually for the previous two decades.
General Electric Corp, which since the 1980s has expanded its global footprint, says it's time for a ""bold pivot"" in strategy to focus on regional centers. In explaining the move last year, GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said he would prefer to operate by free-trade principles, but ""a localization strategy can't be shut down by protectionist politics.""
In practice, that means GE is building up its manufacturing capacity in China and India and other big markets to supply customers there, rather than counting on exports and global links. As part of the strategy, GE signed a deal in 2015 to build locomotives in India, rather than relying on a global production site in the U.S., as it once did. Surveying the global economy from Beijing, where he co-owns eight electronics and medical equipment factories, Dwight Nordstrom, chairman of Pacific Resources International LLC, says he is ""waiting to see how the politics shake out"" before building any Chinese plants aimed at the export market.
That's because local-content rules may require firms like his to build factories in different countries. ""We may be forced to have more factories than makes economic sense,"" he says.
China, once an assembly platform that sucked in commodities and manufactured goods from abroad, put them together and reshipped them, is now producing much of what it needs domestically.
Benjamin Dolgin-Gardner, founder of Hatch International Ltd., an electronics manufacturer in Shenzhen, China, says he now uses Chinese-made LCD screens rather than ones made elsewhere in Asia for the tablets he produces. Memory chips for MP3 players are also made in China rather than imported from Japan and South Korea.
""China is increasingly cannibalizing supply chains,"" says Alex Wolf, a London economist at the investment firm of Standard Life Investments, reducing exports from Korea, Taiwan and other nations whose economies are tightly

linked to China's.
The reaction to the financial crisis in many countries included new banking rules, adopted globally, which require banks to hold bigger capital buffers against securities and loans. That has cut into their willingness to take risk across borders.
Regulators in China, Cyprus, Iceland, Brazil and other countries imposed capital controls to limit the waves of potentially destabilizing money washing into and out of their financial systems. In all, 31 out of 108 countries tracked by economists Menzie Chinn and Hiro Ito became less open to global capital flows between 2008 and 2014, while 13 became more open.
That's a sharp reversal from the five-year precrisis period, when 40 countries became more open to global capital flows and 12 became less open.
Europe is the epicenter of the global lending crunch. Hungary privatized most of its banks after the fall of Communism in 1989, drawing investors from Austria, Italy, Belgium and beyond. By the mid-2000s, Hungarian homeowners had become avid consumers of mortgages issued by Austrian banks denominated in Swiss francs, emblematic of the rapid globalization of European finance.
After the financial crisis, the Swiss franc soared, pushing up the cost of those mortgages. Nearly one-third of Hungarian borrowers went 90 days or more delinquent on their mortgages, inviting a political backlash.
Viktor Orban's nationalist Fidesz party won parliamentary elections with a landslide in 2010 and Mr. Orban set out to increase Hungarian ownership of the banking sector to at least 50%. His administration imposed taxes and fees on the sector and demanded banks convert Swiss franc loans into local currency denominations. Foreign bank lending contracted for eight straight years through 2016, according to the Institute for International Finance, a banking trade association in Washington.
As foreign banks departed, the country's economy minister, Mihaly Varga, told local reporters that the policy ""boosts economic sovereignty."" A 2016 review by the IMF, while lauding Hungary's rebound from the recession, said the government had simply shifted risks from private hands to the public sector, because the Hungarian government took big stakes in banks and other companies.
In wealthy nations, the big hope is that a reversal in globalization will lift wages of unskilled workers by reducing competition from low-wage nations. That hasn't been the case so far. Globally, wage growth slowed to an average 2.1% in the past five years, compared with 2.4% in the five years leading up to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, according to the International Labor Organization.
In the U.S., wages and salaries of workers rose 2% a year in the past five years. That's down from 2.9% in the five years before the crisis.
That hasn't stilled globalization's many critics. ""Globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very, very wealthy,"" Mr. Trump said last June at a Rust Belt stop in Pennsylvania, ""but it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache.""

HSBC,Saudi Aramco Plans to Raise $2 Billion With First Bond Offering; Planned riyal-denominated sukuk bond from kingdom's state-owned oil company will be open to foreign investment," Mar 29, 2017",1,"Saudi Arabia's giant state-owned oil company is preparing to raise about $2 billion with its first bond offering, according to investors who have reviewed the prospectus.
Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Aramco, plans to issue a 7.5 billion riyal-denominated sukuk bond that is in compliant with Islamic law but can be purchased by foreigners, according to these investors.
A sukuk is a bondlike instrument designed for Islamic investors to be non-interest-bearing. Issuance of sukuk bonds has grown strongly in recent years to meet investment demands of Islamic investors, mainly from the Gulf countries and Asia.
""This will be the first monetization of Saudi Aramco,"" said Patrick Drum, a portfolio manager at Saturna Capital, which runs a sukuk bond fund.
The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, according to the prospectus, which hasn't disclosed any financial information on the oil company. The bonds have yet to be priced and the exact timing of the offering is unclear, according to people familiar with the matter.
The Saudi government last year raised $17.5 billion with its first global bond , an effort to shore up finances after oil prices plummeted. That deal was widely marketed around the globe.
By contrast, Saudi Aramco chose to sell its first Islamic bond in the local currency rather than in dollars, a sign that the debt offering is aimed primarily at locals, some investors said.
Mr. Drum, based in Bellingham, Wa., said he is looking at the bonds closely. He said the debt would offer some diversification for his holdings and Saudi corporate bonds are hard to come by.
""I do have a heightened interest but I need more information,"" Mr. Drum said.
Alinma Investment Company, HSBC Saudi Arabia Ltd., NCB Capital Company and Riyad Capital are among the banks that are underwriting the bond sale, according the prospectus which was published on March 27.
The Saudi government has estimated that Aramco is worth more than $2 trillion, and the kingdom is preparing to sell shares to the public as early as next year, according to people familiar with the matter. The offering could raise $100 billion or more, analysts say.
On Monday, Saudi Arabia lowered the tax rate on Aramco to 50% from 85%.

HSBC,"The Depressing Logic Supporting Standard Chartered's Shares; Profitability remains under pressure, though, like HSBC, bank could pay dividends despite limited growth"," Mar 30, 2017",0,"
Standard Chartered has come a long way in a year and so has its stock. The question for investors is whether there is still value in the emerging-markets lender after a near doubling in share price.
The answer depends on whether you want growth or cash. Standard Chartered might fail to find the former. That
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 459 of 1177
should mean more of the latter, eventually, but not perhaps sustainably so.
One thing has helped to drive the bank's stock higher: The recovery in oil prices. True, rising U.S. interest rates have helped banks rally, but the Stoxx index of European banks is up less than 40%.
It must be slightly disheartening for executives that despite all the hard restructuring work they have been doing, the bank's shares remain so closely correlated with oil. This makes less sense after Standard Chartered slashed its commodities exposure by nearly 40% mostly between mid-2014 and the end of 2015.
Fears of commodities-related bad debts and India had dragged down its valuation. At its nadir last February, the stock traded at less than 40% of forecast book value a year ahead. After a recovery, Standard Chartered now trades at about 70% of forecast book value, close to Credit Suisse and ahead of Barclays.
But based on profitability, it isn't worth that. It aims to get to a return on equity of just 8% sometime after 2018. To reach that it needs to keep costs down and find revenue growth, which is proving hard. To make an 8% return in 2019, it needs to boost revenue 30%, according to analysts at Barclays.
The bank thinks it should be able to at least keep pace with emerging market economies, which are forecast to grow by about 5% to 6% a year in the next couple of years, according to the IMF. At 6% growth, it would take about 41?2 years to add 30% to revenue.
Standard Chartered probably isn't going to do that, according to FactSet consensus forecasts, which predict just 13% top-line growth through 2019.
The saving grace is the expectation that the bank could accumulate capital even with this weaker growth. By the end of 2019, it could have slightly more than $3 billion of excess equity, worth about $1 a share.
The bank could return that to shareholders, much as HSBC has started to do since its growth has been slower than hoped. Standard Chartered just about justifies its current valuation assuming a $3 billion capital return at the end of 2019.
But if revenues disappoint, or the bank loses any capital to bad assets or regulators' demands, this valuation will look high. And Standard Chartered will need to cut costs and stop doing some business in more countries, too. Betting on a future special payout is risky.

HSBC,Are Wall Street Banks Doing Enough to Prevent Shoddy Chinese IPOs? China Huishan Dairy is latest in string of companies to struggle after listing in Hong Kong," Mar 31, 2017",1,"
HONG KONG--The strange case of a Chinese dairy company whose stock collapsed last week is raising fresh questions about how thoroughly Western banks are vetting the Chinese firms they bring to market.
This week, China Huishan Dairy Holdings Co. said it lost contact with a top executive and was in talks with its
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 461 of 1177
creditors, following an 85% plunge in its Hong Kong-listed shares on March 24, which knocked $4.1 billion off its value. The drama comes just four years after the company's $1.5 billion initial public offering , which was led by Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings PLC and UBS Group AG.
It isn't known if regulators are looking at Huishan or the banks with regard to the IPO and the banks haven't been accused of wrongdoing; they declined to comment on the matter. Spokesmen for the Hong Kong stock exchange and its regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission, also declined to comment. A Huishan representative didn't return requests for comment.
Still, Huishan's troubles come after the regulator said in November that it would crack down on shoddy work by IPO sponsors --a role that involves scrutinizing the financial health of companies planning to list.
""Some sponsors are not doing what they need to do to find out the truth behind apparent facts,"" when doing due diligence, said Syren Johnstone, a securities regulation expert at the University of Hong Kong. ""The problems may surface soon after a listing or may take some years. In either case, the market and investors suffer.""
The securities regulator in Hong Kong has been examining Morgan Stanley, UBS and Bank of America Corp. in connection with Chinese chemicals company Tianhe Chemicals Group Ltd., which they helped go public in the city in 2014 with a $748 million IPO, according to people familiar with the matter.
In January, the Hong Kong regulator sued UBS, Standard Chartered PLC and KPMG over alleged misconduct related to the 2009 initial public offering of China Forestry Holdings Co., which is being liquidated after its auditor found accounting irregularities.
The regulator is also looking at the 2009 IPO of China Metal Recycling (Holdings) Ltd., for which UBS was one of the sponsors, The Wall Street Journal has reported. The two companies raised more than $400 million combined. UBS and Standard Chartered have said they are facing regulatory investigations for unnamed IPOs and there could be financial consequences. UBS has also said it may temporarily lose its ability to advise on corporate finance in the city. KPMG declined to comment on China Forestry.
Arranging IPOs has been the bread and butter of Western banks in Asia for years, although Hong Kong listings aren't especially lucrative. Fees average around 2.5% of the funds raised, bankers say, where the cut for typical New York IPOs is 6% to 7%.
Asia-based IPO bankers and lawyers say due diligence on Chinese companies--especially verifying physical assets- -is often difficult. They say there isn't much they can do if companies present false information or deliberately mislead them.
Bankers say they have walked away from deals that weren't worth the risk in recent years, especially in light of 2013 rules that hold investment banks and bankers liable for false information in IPO prospectuses.
Chinese banks have also been scrutinized by the Hong Kong regulator. Earlier this month, the Securities and Futures Commission fined a unit of Bank of Communications Co. for incomplete due diligence on a prospective listing, which was rejected. The bank didn't respond to a request for comment.
Huishan, the battered Chinese dairy company, gained notice in December when short seller Muddy Waters Research said it overstated its profit and falsely implied in its IPO prospectus and elsewhere that it was self- sufficient in producing alfalfa, which is used as cattle feed. Huishan disputed the Muddy Waters report by saying it produces at least 90% of its own alfalfa and that its financial statements are accurate.
Tianhe--a chemicals company that makes water and oil repellent used on smartphone screens--was wooed by global banks eager to handle its flotation. But its shares were suspended from trading for more than a month soon after its IPO. In September 2014, an anonymous stock-research group alleged that the company kept two sets of books--one for investors and one for Chinese authorities--and overstated sales.
Tianhe denied the accusations, but trading was halted again at the company's request in March 2015 when it said it wouldn't be able to file its 2014 earnings on time. On Thursday, the company released part of its 2016 financials and said it was working to resume trading.
The Hong Kong regulator has asked Tianhe's sponsors, Morgan Stanley, UBS and Bank of America, about their due diligence ahead of the IPO, according to people familiar with the matter. One of the regulator's requests focused on

the due diligence conducted by the banks on two sets of tax records provided by the company, one of the people said.
Separately, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has looked into correspondence between Morgan Stanley's Asia private-equity fund and investors regarding Tianhe, in which the fund and its co-investors have a 8.9% stake, according to people familiar with the matter.
It isn't clear if the Hong Kong and U.S. probes into Tianhe will lead to disciplinary action and the banks haven't been accused of wrongdoing.
Morgan Stanley's private-equity arm, which invested in Tianhe in 2012, now values its stake at about $188 million, or about 60% of its original investment, according to a document from February viewed by The Wall Street Journal. In private off-market transactions, Tianhe shares are trading at between five and eight Hong Kong cents (US$0.006 to US$0.01) a share, according to a person familiar with the matter, or around 3% of the IPO price.

CFPB Says It Can Do Its Job Even If Its Structure Changes Credit Suisse Contacted by Authorities Over Tax Issues
New Rules Would Make It Easier to Boot ETFs From Exchanges Volcker Rule Data Emerge From the Wilderness
A Democratic congresswoman last week released a rare bird into the financial regulatory jungle: Charts from the Federal Reserve about banks' compliance with the Volcker rule. It was the first time the public has seen such data, even in aggregate form.
The debate that ensued at the House Financial Services Committee showed how difficult it can be to assess the rule's real-world impact, a problem that is likely to vex both its defenders and critics.
Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D., N.Y.) publicized the data on Wednesday at the outset of a hearing on the Volcker rule, which bans banks from most trading or speculating unless they are doing so on customers' behalf. The three-page document prepared by Fed staff and given to Ms. Maloney in response to a letter she wrote to regulators. The underlying data came from trading desks regulated by the Fed, so it might not include data from other desks overseen by other U.S. regulators.
One chart of so-called Sharpe ratios, a measure of risk-adjusted returns, basically indicates that banks are following the rule. They are making profits from new trading positions taken each day, rather than positions held for a longer period of time.
That is consistent with what one would expect if banks were helping their clients, rather than making their own speculative bets, the Fed staff says. To Ms. Maloney, that ""is exactly what Congress intended to happen.""
The document contains two other charts that are more relevant to the current controversy over the Volcker rule: whether it has caused traders to shy away from legitimate activities. This is the case made by both by the financial industry, which wants the rule repealed, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who says he supports the rule but wants to clarify it.
The data show that banks' Value at Risk, a measure of potential losses, stayed broadly stable from April 2015 through the end of last year, excluding dips on holidays. It stayed stable, Ms. Maloney pointed out, even during stressful market conditions at the end of 2015 and beginning of 2016. She said this showed ""banks did not pull back from the markets"" because if they had, their VaR would have dropped.
Republicans and witnesses from the financial industry said VaR isn't a good measure of market liquidity.
""I run a firm that tries to make markets in compliance with the Volcker rule and I will tell you that our ability to do so has been significantly impacted, raising the cost of capital for companies that are creating jobs in this country,"" said Ronald Kruszewski, chief executive of Missouri-based Stifel Financial Corp.
Other data on the Volcker rule have also produced reactions akin to an inkblot test. A Federal Reserve staff paper published at the end of 2016 has been cited by Mr. Mnuchin as proof that the rule ""doesn't allow banks to create enough liquidity for customers"" and by a former senior Fed official as evidence that the rule's impact isn't yet fully

understood.
U.S. regulators are open to reviewing the Volcker rule. Fed governor Jerome Powell, who is likely to soon take over the regulatory responsibilities of departing colleague Daniel Tarullo, has said as much .
The muddled evidence about the rule's impact will complicate that conversation. Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond
WSJ Pro: Republicans Take Step Toward Unwinding Two Postcrisis Restrictions By Rachel Witkowski
WASHINGTON--Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) on Friday asked the U.S. Government Accountability Office to review two significant financial regulatory actions on lending, the first step in a backdoor strategy to unwind some postcrisis restrictions without needing Democratic support.
The directives date back to March 2013. The first one, from bank regulators, restricted so-called leveraged lending, or making corporate loans to entities that are already heavily indebted. The other, from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, held auto lenders responsible for any perceived discriminatory loan pricing at their partner dealerships.
Mr. Toomey asked the GAO to respond by July 1.
A GAO spokesman confirmed receiving Mr. Toomey's requests and said they ""need to be reviewed before any decisions are made.""
Republicans have raised concerns about these two regulatory notices, arguing they significantly altered the industries affected and therefore should have been more thoroughly vetted through the formal rule-making process.
If the GAO determines these notices were equivalent to rules, Congress would have 60 legislative days to vote to rescind the measures through a simple majority.
Republicans have used the tactic, called the Congressional Review Act, to repeal certain Obama-era laws. Mr. Toomey said Thursday that his party wanted to apply that strategy to recent guidance, letters or notices from federal regulators.
The CFPB's ""bulletin appears to be generally applicable, prospective in nature and designed to interpret law,"" Mr. Toomey wrote the GAO's comptroller general, Gene Dodaro. ""The CFPB is currently applying it assiduously, with meaningful consequences for lenders and borrowers alike.""
The consumer watchdog has cited a handful of major indirect auto lenders including Toyota Motor Credit Corp., American Honda Finance Corp. and Ally Financial Inc. since issuing the guidance. House Republicans have failed in their attempts to rescind it through legislation.
The CFPB didn't respond to a request for comment. The agency has defended its actions. However, an official said
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 466 of 1177

in a December blog post that the agency was shifting its focus away from auto lenders and credit cards in terms of 2017 priorities for the fair lending office.
""We have examined over a dozen of the nation's largest auto lenders and achieved important market awareness and movement,"" Patrice Ficklin, the CFPB's assistant director in fair lending, wrote. ""A wide range of supervisory compliance solutions tailored to each lender will work to secure and advance our progress in protecting consumers.""
The other directive on Mr. Toomey's radar, on leveraged lending, was issued by the three prudential bank regulators: the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
The three agencies declined to comment on Mr. Toomey's request. They have publicly defended the restrictions, citing concerns about banks doing more leveraged lending in recent years.
This increase ""is common during the later stages of the economic cycle, which happens to be where we are today. But it also signals a rise in credit risk that bank risk officers must be aware of,"" Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry said in November 2015.
Leveraged lending remains the largest risk in credits shared among firms, representing nearly 73% of shared credits flagged by regulators as ""special mention"" or worse in the first half of 2016, according to the latest report from the regulators.
The industry says the restrictions went too far, pointing to a drop in loan volume by the hundreds of billions of dollars since 2013.
CFPB Says It Can Do Its Job Even If Its Structure Changes By Yuka Hayashi
WASHINGTON--The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Friday pushed back against the Justice Department's contention that its independent structure is unconstitutional, but said it could still do its job even if a court orders structural changes.
The consumer watchdog created under the Obama administration is stepping up its defense ahead of a federal appeals court hearing in May that could significantly transform its operations.
Responding to the court's request for a possible remedy if the agency's structure is ruled unconstitutional, the CFPB said if its structure is altered and the president gains the power to fire its director at will, it will still be able to function in the manner consistent with its original mission.
The CFPB presented its argument two weeks after the Trump administration's Justice Department asked the court to restructure the consumer watchdog, an unusual circumstance. Typically in a court case, federal agencies don't take opposing sides.
The dispute stems from a case in which the CFPB alleged PHH Corp., a New Jersey mortgage lender, violated the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act by accepting kickbacks from mortgage insurers. The case has become part of a thorny political battle as Republicans look for ways to weaken the CFPB, which they have long criticized as an
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 467 of 1177

example of regulatory overreach.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is set to hold a new hearing of the case on May 24.
The CFPB was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law to consolidate consumer protection functions previously scattered among several regulators into a single agency.
""Neither PHH nor the United States has provided any basis for distinguishing the Bureau from Supreme Court precedent upholding the constitutionality of independent agencies,"" CFPB lawyers wrote.
The PHH case has gone through various twists and turns in recent months, as a three-judge panel ruled the CFPB's structure unconstitutional and gave the president power to remove its director at will. The holding was invalidated four months later by the same court, paving the way for a rehearing. ""A single-headed independent agency presents a greater risk than a multi-member independent commission of taking actions or adopting policies inconsistent with the President's executive policy,"" the Justice Department wrote in its brief March 17.
The CFPB also argued that the court couldn't avoid addressing its constitutionality in the PHH case because the earlier ruling by the panel regarding the violation of the real estate settlement law was ""incorrect"" and couldn't provide an independent basis for vacating the ruling.
""Even if it could avoid the issue, this Court should nonetheless address it because the issue is ripe and recurs with increasing frequency,"" the CFPB lawyers wrote.
Several groups supporting the CFPB also filed briefs Friday, asking the court to rule in favor of the agency. Among them is a group of 40 former and current members of Congress from the Democratic Party, including Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the party's leader in the Senate Banking Committee; Rep. Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee; and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who helped to build the consumer bureau.
""The CFPB represents a constitutionally permissible and effective experiment in agency design,"" wrote three leading financial regulation scholars as they pointed to the agency's record of returning billions of dollars to consumers harmed by the financial industry and helping to resolve individual disputes efficiently. ""These results show the value of allowing Congress to adjust independent agency design."" The group was led by Michael Barr, a University of Michigan law professor and a key member of the Obama administration team that drafted Dodd- Frank.
Credit Suisse Contacted by Authorities Over Tax Issues By Brian Blackstone
ZURICH-- Credit Suisse Group AG offices in three European countries were targeted by authorities in a tax investigation, a fresh headache for the Swiss lender just months after it agreed to pay billions of dollars to resolve a major legal case with the U.S.
The bank said on Friday that local authorities were in contact with its offices in London, Paris and Amsterdam. The Dutch financial-fraud prosecutor said it is investigating dozens of people and had seized jewlery, artwork and a gold bar from homes in the Netherlands as part of its probe. It didn't specify any bank as part of the investigation.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 468 of 1177

Credit Suisse didn't provide details of the nature of the contact, though the bank said in a statement that it ""continues to follow a strategy of full client tax compliance.""
In the Dutch investigation, the prosecutor for financial fraud, FIOD, said it is investigating dozens of people who are ""alleged to have concealed many millions of euros from the authorities by placing them in Swiss bank accounts."" Investigations are also going on in Australia, Germany, the U.K. and France. It said it has acquired information about thousands of account holders and more operations would be carried out in the weeks ahead.
The action angered Swiss authorities, who weren't consulted. The attorney general's office said it is ""concerned that Switzerland was specifically excluded when this operation was organized"" and that it ""expects a written explanation from the responsible Dutch authorities, and is considering what further action needs to be taken.""
Meanwhile, the U.K. tax authority, HM Revenue and Customs, said it opened a criminal investigation, jointly with other countries, into ""suspected tax evasion and money laundering by a global financial institution and certain of its employees."" The HMRC also didn't name the bank.
The HMRC said the probe will spur ""further, targeted, activity over the coming weeks"" and is focused on ""senior employees from within the institution, along with a number of its customers.""
The sums involved in the investigations don't appear large. In a statement Friday, the European Union's Judicial Cooperation Unit pegged hidden, undeclared assets under investigation as being ""in the millions of euros.""
Credit Suisse's disclosure Friday was a reminder that the Swiss lender still faces legal uncertainties after dealing with costly regulatory actions in recent years. In December, the bank reached a settlement worth roughly $5.3 billion with the U.S. Justice Department over toxic mortgage securities sold before the financial crisis.
In 2014, Credit Suisse admitted it conspired to aid tax evasion and agreed to pay $2.6 billion to settle a long- running probe by the U.S. Justice Department.
The Swiss bank, which has been shifting its focus away from trading to focus more on wealth management, also faces an investigation into whether its Israel desk helped clients cancel U.S. tax obligations.

New Rules Would Make It Easier to Boot ETFs From Exchanges
By Chris Dieterich
New rules set to take effect in October could tap the brakes on the proliferation of new exchange-traded funds in the fast-growing industry.
As ETFs in the $2.8 billion marketplace become more complex, securities regulators say they're looking to shield investors from thinly traded securities that could be vulnerable to price manipulation.
The Securities and Exchange Commission this month gave the final go-ahead for measures that would trigger the delisting process for an ETF should its index become overly concentrated, or stocks and bonds in an index become
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 469 of 1177

hard to trade.
The new rules were put forward by U.S. exchanges at the behest of the SEC, according to people familiar with the matter. A spokesman for the SEC declined to comment beyond its approval.
Spokespeople for exchanges Nasdaq and Bats declined to comment on the number of ETFs that might face delisting when the rules are implemented later this year. Douglas Yones, head of NYSE ETFs, said that the continuous listing standards in their current form may ""cause undue costs for fund managers as well as a negative impact for investors, without offering additional protections for the shareholders of the ETF.""
Industry participants said that certain ETFs that follow overseas markets are most likely run afoul of the new rules.
Investor demand for index-tracking ETFs has ballooned in recent years in part due to lower management fees and strong performance versus actively managed mutual funds. Analysts expect the trend to accelerate. Consultancy PwC forecasts that North American ETF assets will more than double, to $5.9 trillion, by 2021.
As the industry grows apace, regulators have sought to learn more about the ETF ecosystem and have pushed fund companies and market makers to provide greater disclosure. The new listing standards are among of the first specific changes since the SEC's evaluation of the ETF industry intensified following trading irregularities on Aug. 24, 2015, when many popular ETFs saw prices deviate from their index values.
""ETFs have taken off dramatically,"" said Bob Kurucza, a partner at law firm Goodwin Procter LP. ""The regulator has a tendency to want to slow things down and get their arms around that growth.""
The new rules were approved over the opposition of fund companies, who challenged the SEC to explicitly spell out what abuses the new rules aim to prevent.
At issue are standards that an ETF must meet in order remain listed and trading. The new rules would require an ETF's index components to meet liquidity and diversification conditions on an ongoing basis instead of passing muster solely at the point of launch. Fund companies would be required to report non-compliant ETFs to the listing exchange, which would then start the process of delisting the ETF.
The SEC said in filings that regular check-ups of ETF indexes will bolster transparency and reduce the potential for aberrant price moves.
""They seem to be trying to avoid a situation where components have shrunk to a size that they can be subject to manipulation,"" said Eric Noll, chief executive of Convergex Group, a brokerage, and a member of the SEC's Equity Market Structure Advisory Committee.
Fund companies including BlackRock, State Street Global Advisors and Invesco Ltd., have bristled, arguing that implementation of the standards will be burdensome. Comment letters submitted by fund companies also say that there is scant evidence of the kind of manipulation the SEC says it's hoping to prevent.
""There simply is no explanation of a nexus between the stated concern and the proposed rules,"" wrote David Blass, the general counsel for the Investment Company Institute, a trade group.
Fund companies, which mostly license third-party indexes, argue that they don't directly control the benchmarks.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 470 of 1177

""ETFs could be delisted because of circumstances outside of their control, which would have significant consequences for ETF investors,"" wrote executives from BlackRock, the largest ETF provider, in a letter to the SEC.
Are Wall Street Banks Doing Enough to Prevent Shoddy Chinese IPOs? By Julie Steinberg
HONG KONG--The strange case of a Chinese dairy company whose stock collapsed last week is raising fresh questions about how thoroughly Western banks are vetting the Chinese firms they bring to market.
This week, China Huishan Dairy Holdings Co. said it lost contact with a top executive and was in talks with its creditors, following an 85% plunge in its Hong Kong-listed shares on March 24, which knocked $4.1 billion off its value. The drama comes just four years after the company's $1.5 billion initial public offering, which was led by Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings HSBC -0.56% PLC and UBS Group AG.
It isn't known if regulators are looking at Huishan or the banks with regard to the IPO and the banks haven't been accused of wrongdoing; they declined to comment on the matter. Spokesmen for the Hong Kong stock exchange and its regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission, also declined to comment. A Huishan representative didn't return requests for comment.
Still, Huishan's troubles come after the regulator said in November that it would crack down on shoddy work by IPO sponsors--a role that involves scrutinizing the financial health of companies planning to list.
""Some sponsors are not doing what they need to do to find out the truth behind apparent facts,"" when doing due diligence, said Syren Johnstone, a securities regulation expert at the University of Hong Kong. ""The problems may surface soon after a listing or may take some years. In either case, the market and investors suffer.""
The securities regulator in Hong Kong has been examining Morgan Stanley , UBS and Bank of America Corp. in connection with Chinese chemicals company Tianhe Chemicals Group Ltd., which they helped go public in the city in 2014 with a $748 million IPO, according to people familiar with the matter.

WSJ Pro: Fed's Tarullo Headed for MIT, Temporarily at Least By Ryan Tracy
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 472 of 1177

Federal Reserve governor Daniel Tarullo is headed for a temporary post at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after his last day Wednesday, according to a report in the Boston Globe on Friday that was confirmed by a Fed spokesman.
The Boston native will be a distinguished fellow at MIT's Golub Center for Finance and Policy.
Mr. Tarullo, the central bank's regulatory point person, in February wrote to President Donald Trump that he would resign on or about April 5.
His departure will give Mr. Trump more freedom to remake the central bank and to accelerate a deregulatory agenda by putting his own appointees in charge of overseeing Wall Street. Three of the seven slots on the Fed's board of governors will be vacant upon Mr. Tarullo's resignation.
For Chinese Companies, If You Can't Move Money Overseas, Raise It Overseas By Rachel Rosenthal
Chinese companies struggling to get their money out of the country have come up with an alternative: raise money overseas.
Chinese firms have issued some $52.6 billion worth of U.S. dollar bonds in the first quarter, up 72% from the previous three months, according to Dealogic, and nearly five times the amount from the first quarter of 2016.
The surge has come as Beijing has tightened curbs on capital outflows, making it harder for Chinese companies to use their yuan earned domestically overseas. Those companies looking to make acquisitions abroad, or even just pay back existing dollar debt, are increasingly turning to the U.S. dollar markets to raise funds.
""If a company is considering an overseas acquisition and looking for financing, even if it is sitting on billions of [yuan] onshore, it may struggle to transfer [that money] offshore to pay for it,"" said David Yim, head of debt capital markets for Greater China at Standard Chartered in Hong Kong.
Some bankers say much of the demand for Chinese dollar bonds is coming from Chinese investors who have stowed money overseas. The pent-up demand for those bonds is raising concerns that some riskier Chinese firms are able to issue offshore debt too cheaply, at yields that aren't far enough above those for safer, blue-chip companies.
""Spreads [for Chinese high-yield debt] are very narrow relative to investment grade, so the compensation isn't a good one,"" said Andy Seaman, London-based chief investment officer at Stratton Street Capital, which manages $1.3 billion of assets.
Some Chinese companies are tapping the dollar debt market because Beijing officials are curbing fundraising at home in certain overheated sectors such as real estate--a reversal from the past couple of years, when regulators made it cheap and easy for such borrowers to get funding. Domestic bond issuance in the first quarter fell 64% from a year ago to $91 billion, according to Dealogic.
In mid-March, one of China's largest and most indebted property developers, China Evergrande Group , priced three
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 473 of 1177

dollar bonds in Hong Kong within a week for a total of $2.5 billion, which the company says it will use to refinance existing debt.
Evergrande's latest issues include a $500 million, three-year bond with a 7% coupon; a $1 billion, five-year bond with an 8.25% coupon; and a $1 billion, seven-year bond with a 9.5% coupon. While those yields look ""punchy,"" they are still too low considering Evergrande's junk rating, said Rick Mattila, international head of market strategy at MUFG Securities Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong. An Evergrande spokeswoman declined to comment.
In the near term, the yuan's rise against the dollar will make it easier to pay back dollar debt: The yuan is up 0.9% this year versus the greenback after sliding 6.6% in 2016. Longer term, however, the outlook is less certain, bankers say.
Some bankers say the fact that more than half of the first quarter's dollar issuance by Chinese companies has come from financial institutions could herald a rise in deal activity; banks need dollars to lend out to companies that are buying dollar assets. One of the biggest deals was a $2 billion bond issued by ICBCIL Finance Co., a unit of Industrial &Commercial Bank of China, which priced on Thursday.
Meanwhile, some big Chinese companies are raising money because they are looking to refinance as bonds come due this year and in 2018, or to meet other obligations.
""Capital controls have made it harder for Chinese companies to move funds out of the country for business purposes, so many are borrowing offshore instead,"" said Rita Chan, head of China debt capital markets at Goldman Sachs .
In mid-March, Beijing-based Lenovo Group Ltd. , the world's largest personal-computer maker by shipments, issued five-year bonds worth $500 million with a 3.875% coupon and $850 million of 5.375% perpetual bonds that have no maturity date. On Friday, the company added $150 million to its perpetual-bond issue, bringing the total to $1 billion.
In 2014, Lenovo agreed to buy Motorola Mobility Holdings LLC from Google Inc. for $2.91 billion. That price tag included a $1.5 billion, three-year promissory note to Google. Lenovo's latest bond issues help the company refinance that note and will go toward repaying Google for the acquisition. A Lenovo spokeswoman declined to comment.

One of the biggest deals of the quarter was a $2 billion bond issued by ICBCIL Finance Co., a unit of Industrial &Commercial Bank of China, which priced on Thursday. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Industrial &Commercial Bank issued the bond.
China's Tectonic Shift in Bank Funding
Ghosts of financial crises past rarely revisit in exactly the same way. Still, stresses looming in China's behemoth banking system eerily resemble the ones its U.S. counterpart suffered just ahead of its meltdown a decade ago.
They can be seen in this week's Chinese bank earnings, which reveal a structural shift. The ample trapped savings in the form of deposits that have long funded banks' lending are withering away. Deposits' share of the system's

Innovation Needed in Credit Scoring
Traditional credit-scoring systems don't serve the needs of many homebuyers, particularly younger ones, according to a research brief by Ellen Seidman of the Urban Institute. Current scoring models exclude too many people who might be able to support a mortgage in their ZIP Code, she writes. Beyond certain scoring issues such as putting too much weight on medical debt, scoring bureaus also need to improve the scope and accuracy of the data they use to calculate scores.

HSBC,Outlook Brightening for Euro Zone Banks," Apr 3, 2017",1,"THE PROSPECTS FOR EUROPE'S BATTLE-WORN FINANCIAL SECtor could be improving, as the region's more positive economic outlook fuels hopes that negative interest rates might soon be a thing of the past.
There's good reason to believe that the euro zone is on a surer footing now than it was even a few months ago, when it faced a number of economic and political challenges.
Inflation is up, unemployment is down, and concerns that anti-European Union populists would make significant gains at key elections this year have subsided for now. The Dutch election in March was won by the incumbent centerright party, fending offa populist challenger and allaying concerns that France's antieuro, anti-immigration National Front could win the presidential election there in a month's time.
Persistently weak inflation in recent years drove the European Central Bank into the previously uncharted territory of negative interest rates, meaning that banks are effectively paying to keep cash on deposit. Most are reluctant to pass that cost on to their own savers, so profit margins have been squeezed.
The good news is that euro zone inflation exceeded the ECB's target of just below 2% for the first time in four years in February. Unemployment, the currency's bloc's other be?te noire, has finally slipped into single digits. It stood at 9.6% in both December and January, its lowest since 2009.
Those figures, along with growing business confidence and rising retail sales, have increased speculation that the ECB could start tapering its quantitative-easing program and raise interest rates. One such move is already in the pipeline, although the ECB insists that it doesn't indicate the start of a tapering plan. From April, it will reduce the value of its monthly bond purchases to 60 billion euros ($64.34 billion) from the current euro80 billion. The program is slated to run until the end of the year.
ECB officials are typically cautious, saying they need to see more evidence of a recovery before making any further moves. Rising inflation, for example, owes much to a recent recovery in oil prices and slipped back to 1.5% in March, missing forecasts. Still, some economists have enough confidence in the euro zone outlook to suggest that the ECB could start winding down quantitative easing and liftinterest rates within the next year.
That would be great news for the euro zone banks that have been laid low by a series of setbacks. Pressure on earnings from negative interest rates came when they were still shaking offfallout from the financial crisis and coping with rising regulatory costs.
Rob Lutts, chief investment officer at Salem, Mass.- based Cabot Wealth Management, likes a range of European finance stocks that includes the United Kingdom's HSBC Holdings (ticker: HSBC.UK), Spain's Banco Santander (SAN.Spain), France's BNP Paribas (BNP.France), and German insurer Allianz (ALV.Germany), while admitting that the sector is still a controversial call.
To mitigate risk, he has opted to get broad and safer exposure to those stocks through an exchange-traded fund, but he particularly likes HSBC.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 478 of 1177
""HSBC has a very vast reach across the globe in many different areas, and the potential of its earnings power isn't appreciated today,"" he says. He sees HSBC as a type of warrant on emerging markets because of its strong exposure to Asia.
HSBC has increased its focus on Asia and away from Latin America as part of its recent restructuring drive.
Along with other banks, its stock was lifted by rising bond yields starting about the middle of last year. It's up by roughly 50% from a year ago. That progress came to a grinding halt when the bank reported disappointing fourth- quarter results last month.
Falling revenue and charges brought full-year pretax profit down more than 62%, to $7.1 billion, less than half the amount analysts had forecast. After hitting a 52-week high of 7.15 pounds ($8.94) the day before the earnings release, it plunged 6.5% just after.
It closed on Friday at £6.56.
The upshot is that the stock is relatively cheap, trading at a forward price/earnings ratio of 13.68, according to FactSet Research, compared with an average of 15.51 for the Stoxx Europe 600 index.
Morgan Stanley analyst Chris Manners has HSBC at Equal Weight with a price target of £7.45, giving it upside of about 13% from the current price. He says that the bank's longer-term revenue outlook is improving, helped by loan growth in the Asia-Pacific region.
""We also see HSBC as a beneficiary of steeper yield curves with a loan-to-deposit ratio of just 68% at December 2016, which should support net interest margins, particularly in Hong Kong,"" he says.

HSBC,Making Sense of Europe ETFs," Apr 3, 2017",0,"
THE UNITED KINGDOM GOVERNMENT INVOKED ARTICLE 50 OF THE LISbon Treaty on Wednesday, triggering a two-year countdown for the U.K. and the European Union to agree on terms. The headlines are calling it a divorce, but on Wall Street, Brexit appears to be more of a conscious uncoupling, as European stock indexes rose slightly.
As fears of political and economic instability in Europe have waned, the bulls are running. Some $1.5 billion has gone into Europe-focused exchange-traded funds in the last week, the largest inflow in more than a year. ""There are many macroeconomists that say the U.S. has been in a strong bull market and that strength is shifting to Europe,"" says Matt Hougan, CEO of Inside ETFs.
As in the U.S., rising rates are a driving factor for stocks. Goldman Sachs expects bond yields in the U.S. and Germany to rise 0.5% to 0.6% over the next year, which will help banks. European banks are also trading at steep discounts, with some at half the valuation of U.S. banks. JPMorgan Chase's (ticker: JPM) price-to-book ratio is 1.4; Credit Suisse Group's (CS) is 0.8, and Deutsche Bank's (DB) is 0.4. Dividend payouts should also rise 10% to 12%, according to Goldman. Consumer staples, however, are pricey and have subpar growth prospects.
There are 42 Europe-centric ETFs, but almost no sector ETFs for European companies. There are two big decisions when it comes to buying Europe-specific stock ETFs, Hougan says: ""The first is, Europe or euro zone?"" Europe ETFs are made up of European countries by geography, whereas euro zone ETFs hold stocks only from countries that use the euro as their currency. That leaves out nine European nations-including the U.K., Switzerland, Denmark, and Poland-and all the big multinationals and smaller regional companies domiciled there.
That's significant: Companies in the U.K. and Switzerland make up nearly 45% of the total market capitalization of Europe. The $1.7 billion iShares Core MSCI Europe ETF (IEUR), for instance, has 976 stocks, with an average market value of $29 billion. The $9 billion iShares MSCI Eurozone (EZU) has just 245 stocks, with an average market value of $37 billion. The $11 billion Vanguard FTSE Europe (VGK) owns more than 1,100 companies, with an average market cap of $30 billion. All three funds have nearly identical sector weightings, with 20% in financial stocks, but the euro zone fund is missing big banks like HSBC Holdings (HSBA.UK), which gained 50% in the past year.
The second big decision when investing in Europe, Hougan says, is whether or not to buy a hedged fund, which minimizes the effect of currency swings and generally is better in periods when the dollar is strong. Hedged funds were popular in 2015 and 2016, as the dollar got stronger and stronger. (When the dollar rises against the euro, the value of your European stock holdings decreases.) The $9 billion WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity (HEDJ) has beaten 98% of its Europe ETF peers, as well as the MSCI ACWI Ex U.S. Index, over the past one, three, and five years.
Cumberland Advisors manages $2.8 billion, all of which is in ETFs, and uses both hedged and unhedged funds. ""Currency is so volatile,"" says Matt McAleer, Cumberland's managing director and portfolio manager, ""that if you are hedged for a long period of time, you can be right on the underlying equity but still walk out of the door with no money."""
HSBC,European Firms Head East for Bonds; Companies tapping Southeast Asian bond markets in a move to diversify their sources of funding," Apr 5, 2017",1,"
More European companies are tapping Southeast Asian bond markets, in a move to diversify their sources of funding.
They are following their U.S. peers--to Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong--as strict regulations on capital exports make it less attractive for European firms to raise capital in China .
European companies in the first quarter issued 25 so-called ""Formosa"" bonds worth $7.9 billion in Southeast Asia, according to data provided by Dealogic. The majority of bonds were issued in Taiwan.
Telefo?nica SA, the Spanish telecommunications firm, at the end of March raised $200 million, through a private placement in Taiwan, a first for the company. The deal is part of Telefo?nica's ongoing efforts to strengthen its balance sheet with long-term financing, a spokeswoman said.
""We are detecting a growing interest from Asian investors in European issuances,"" she said.
Telefo?nica's debt sale comes on the back of earlier issuances by Vodafone Group PLC in February and by Electricite de France SA in the fall of 2016. A number of European banks, including Barclays PLC and HSBC Holdings PLC, also recently sold bonds in Asia.
European firms still trail their U.S. counterparts --U.S. issuance in Southeast Asia during the first three months of the year amounted to $9.2 billion--but the market is growing, bankers say. Bond sales by U.S. firms tend to be bigger in size than those of their European peers.
""We are seeing that change now,"" said Isabelle Toledano, head of corporate debt capital markets at UBS Group AG in London.
Placing debt in Asia helps European treasurers diversify their sources of funding, Ms. Toledano said.
Most of the capital raised in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore is done in U.S. dollars and needs to be swapped back to euros. Still, the capital comes at a competitive price, said Andrew Wallis, director at Aroundtown Property Holdings PLC, a German real-estate firm.
Aroundtown recently raised $400 million, via a private placement in Hong Kong. It is the third time the firm has tapped Southeast Asian capital markets.
The surge of these issuances by European firms comes despite strong availability of capital in their home markets. The European Central Bank's corporate bond buying program has resulted in lower yields, making it cheaper for
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 483 of 1177
firms to raise capital in Europe.
Issuing in Southeast Asia is complementary to issuing in Europe, Mr. Wallis said. ""We see it as a great add-on to our financing universe,"" he said. Aroundtown in 2016 raised nearly [euro]2.6 billion ($2.7 billion) in Europe. However, it takes a while for Southeast Asian investors to get to know European issuers, said Christophe Salmon, CFO at Trafigura Group Pte. Ltd., a commodities trading company.
""As a privately-owned company, we require more in-depth analysis which means it takes time until investors get more familiar with us,"" Mr. Salmon said. Trafigura in March raised $600 million in Singapore.
Raising capital in mainland China, on the contrary, is much less attractive for European firms.
Foreign companies can--with the help of Panda-bonds--issue yuan-denominated debt in mainland China. However, Chinese regulators want foreign issuers to spend the proceeds of their bond sales domestically.
""The use of proceeds is the biggest issue for potential European investors,"" said Scott Barton, head of corporate banking at Standard Chartered PLC in London.
In some cases, the regulator allows the overseas transfer of capital raised in China, especially if it benefits Chinese entities.
Veolia Environnement SA, the French utilities firm, in September 2016 was able to take 1 billion yuan ($145 million) out of the country, Mr. Barton said.
The firm had lengthy discussions with regulators early on. ""Convincing the authorities to allow the transfer of the funds outside of China was not easy,"" said Claire Be?chaux, Veolia's group treasurer.

HSBC,"Czech Central Bank Drops Euro-Tied Forex Target; Move indicates less concern about European deflation, may set table for interest-rate increase"," Apr 6, 2017",1,"
The Czech central bank on Thursday dropped its target for the koruna's exchange rate against the euro, a fresh sign that Europe has put the threat of deflation behind it and is looking forward to a more normal monetary policy. The move set the central bank on a path to be one of the first in Europe to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in raising its key interest rate . The Fed first raised its short-term rates at the end of 2015, and followed up with similar moves in December 2016 and March. But no European equivalent has yet followed suit.
""We believe the FX floor decision is the first step in a gradual tightening cycle with a rate hike likely in November,"" said Agata Urbanska-Giner, an economist at HSBC. ""That next step is conditional on no aggressive FX appreciation and wage growth trending higher.""
The Czech National Bank became the second non-euro central bank to abandon a euro peg in a little over two years. But unlike the Swiss National Bank's decision in January 2015 to drop a franc ceiling without warning-- which caused the euro to collapse as much as 30% intraday against the franc and the Swiss stock market to plunge nearly 9% the day it occurred--the Czech move had been telegraphed for months. The Czech currency rose
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 485 of 1177
just slightly after the announcement and Czech stocks hardly moved.
The CNB adopted the target of around 27 korun to the euro in November 2013 as a way of boosting inflation by ensuring the koruna didn't strengthen against the euro, which would have lowered the prices of imported goods and services.
The precise timing of the central bank's decision to abandon the target came as a surprise, although it had warned after its March 30 meeting that an end date was ""approaching,"" without being more specific. Policy makers had been scheduled to next meet on May 4, when an announcement on the target was expected. Instead of waiting for that date, policy makers held an extraordinary meeting Thursday.
The central bank said that while the currency's exchange rate would now be determined by supply and demand in the foreign-exchange markets, it ""stands ready to use its instruments to mitigate potential excessive exchange rate fluctuations if needed.""
In addition to limiting falls in import prices, the target was designed to support economic activity by ensuring a stronger koruna didn't make Czech exports more expensive for their foreign buyers.
The target was put in place when parts of Europe faced the threat of deflation, linked in part to the eurozone economy's weakness as it emerged from a government debt and banking crisis. The Czech Republic's main export markets are in the eurozone, most notably Germany.
But with the Czech Republic's annual rate of inflation surging over recent months, to 2.6% in February from just 0.5% a year earlier, speculation had grown that the central bank would drop the currency target. As investors bet on an appreciation of the koruna, the central bank had been spending vast amounts to keep the target in place.
By effectively pre-announcing the move, Czech officials had hoped to limit gains in the koruna once the target was formally abandoned. They have had the opportunity to learn from the SNB, which abandoned a similar target for the franc in early 2015 without any advance warning. That went down in financial history as the ""franc shock,"" and the result was a surge in the currency's value that ultimately led to a 23-billion-franc paper loss by the SNB in 2015. The SNB recouped that loss last year.
The Czech move will be closely watched around Europe, where other central banks are starting to mull a move away from the unconventional stimulus policies--such as negative interest rates--they put in place during the eurozone crisis and its aftermath.
At the ECB, which sets the tone for monetary policy across the continent, divisions over when to take a first step toward normalization were in evidence in a series of speeches by policy makers Thursday.

HSBC,"Saudi Arabia Readies for Debut Dollar Sukuk Amid Efforts to Diversify Economy; As oil revenues decline, the kingdom is looking to raise funds"," Apr 11, 2017",1,"RIYADH--Saudi Arabia opened books Tuesday for its U.S. dollar benchmark debut sukuk bond, according to a banker involved in the transaction.
The initial price guidance is around 115 basis points over mid-swaps for the five-year tranche and about 155 basis points over mid-swaps for the 10-year tranche.
Both tranches are of benchmark size, which is usually at least $500 million. The transaction, under the Saudi Arabia's Trust Certificate Issuance Program, is expected Wednesday.
Citi, HSBC and J.P. Morgan have been hired as joint global coordinators. BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank and NCB Capital, together with the coordinators, are mandated as joint lead managers and bookrunners.
Saudi Arabia sold bonds worth $17.5 billion for the first time in the international markets in 2016, in the largest- ever debt issue by a developing country.
The kingdom is raising money to boost its finances as income from oil sales declines. Crude prices have fallen sharply since the middle of 2014, pushing Saudi Arabia to pursue an ambitious plan to reshape its oil-dependent economy .

HSBC,Saudi Arabia Raises $9 Billion in First International Sukuk Issuance; Kingdom pursues ambitious plan to reshape its oil-focused economy," Apr 12, 2017",1,"Saudi Arabia has raised $9 billion in its first international sale of Islamic bonds, or sukuk, people familiar with the transaction said Wednesday, as the kingdom rolls out an ambitious plan to reshape its oil-dependent economy. The Saudi bonds will be split equally between five- and 10-year tranches after bankers received orders in total exceeding $33 billion, according to bankers and investors. The Saudi government was able to issue more than the $8 billion it had planned to sell, and yields were lower than initial guidance.
The five-year notes were sold at 2.93%, and the 10-year notes were sold at 3.65%.
Saudi Arabia, like other energy-exporting countries in the Middle East, is raising money to support its finances as income from oil sales declines. It cut spending and subsidies to rein in its budget deficit, which had ballooned to a record $98 billion in 2015 but shrank last year to about $79 billion as those austerity measures took effect. Saudi Arabia expects to run a deficit of about $53 billion in 2017 and hopes to balance its finances by 2020, its Finance Ministry said in December.
""The sukuk should cover about one-fifth of the expected fiscal deficit,"" according to investors who reviewed the prospectus.
Saudi Arabia issued bonds worth $17.5 billion in 2016, tapping for the first time the international markets in the largest-ever debt sale by a developing country, and has said it would continue to tap the markets for its financing needs as it works to diversify its economy by boosting the private sector.

""They're kicking the oil barrel down the road; they're buying time on the fiscal deficit,"" said Patrick Drum, a portfolio manager at Bellingham, Wash.-based Saturna Capital, which runs a sukuk-bond fund.
Saudi Arabia's $9 billion bond sale also set the record for this year's emerging-market debt issuance, topping Kuwait's $8 billion deal in March. For the first quarter, government and corporate bonds in emerging markets sold a total of $179 billion in dollar-denominated debt, an all-time high for the period. With bond yields in most of the developed world still near historical lows, global investors have been pouring money into emerging-market debt. Emerging-market debt investors are also attracted by Saudi Arabia's relatively high credit rating and its large proven oil reserves. ""It is one of the few countries in emerging markets that have a high investment grade,"" Mr. Drum said.
Fitch Ratings last month downgraded the country's foreign sovereign credit rating by one notch to A-plus, citing the wider-than-expected fiscal deficit in 2016 and continued doubts about the implementation of the government's ambitious reform program. Standard &Poor's has an A-minus rating for Saudi Arabia and Moody's keeps it at A1, both with a stable outlook.
Saudi Arabian officials began to meet investors over the weekend and had opened books for the sukuk Tuesday. Sukuk is structured to abide by Islam's ban on interest payments, typically by incorporating assets or cash flow in the underlying transaction. Issuers as a result are able to tap a wider pool of investors than with more conventional bonds.
The final spread was one percentage point over the agreed benchmark interest rate for the five-year tranche and 1.4 percentage points over the agreed benchmark rate for the 10-year tranche. The initial price guidance was around 1.15 percentage points over the so-called midswap rate and about 1.55 percentage points over midswaps, respectively, for the two tranches.
Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings PLC and J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. are the joint global coordinators. BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG and NCB Capital, together with the coordinators, have been mandated as joint lead managers and bookrunners.

HSBC,Hedge Funds Are Missing Out on China-Stock Surge; Chinese stocks' banner year is failing to persuade major foreign investors to jump in," Apr 13, 2017",1,"Corrections &Amplifications

Chinese stocks' banner year is failing to persuade major foreign investors like big hedge funds.
They're wary for reasons including China's slowing economy , growing debt and history of market crashes . There are fears, too, of a U.S.-China trade war. Others say they are finding surer, if less dramatic, gains closer to home-- from U.S. stocks, for example, up 5.1% in 2017.
But the funds are being smoked by Chinese stocks. The average global hedge fund was up 2.3% through April 7, according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research, Inc., while the MSCI China index, which mostly tracks Chinese companies listed in places like Hong Kong and New York, gained 14%.
""We haven't seen many funds get overly bullish in Chinese equities markets, so most missed the recent move,"" said Robert Duggan, partner at New York-based SkyBridge Capital, which invests in hedge funds and runs $11.8 billion in assets, with no direct exposure to Asia.
A recovery in producer prices in China and a broad rally in commodities have helped stoke Chinese stocks in Hong Kong, as has increased buying by mainland investors. In the U.S., Chinese tech giants like Alibaba Group Holding and JD.com Inc. have also rallied.
China's currency, the yuan, forecast to continue a slide that took it down almost 7% against the dollar last year, instead has mostly held steady .
A number of macro-hedge-fund managers were in and out of the yuan market in late 2015 and into 2016, betting on a sharp drop, only to mostly lose hope and throw in the towel by the middle of the year, said Skybridge's Mr. Duggan. China's central bank has repeatedly stepped in to slow the currency's fall, limiting funds' gains.
Many have remained wary of China since.
Major global investors are finding more lucrative opportunities elsewhere in Asia-Pacific, said Dan McNicholas, Nomura's Asia-Pacific head of capital introductions, which acts as a matchmaker between hedge funds and sources of investment.
""China has been what I'd class as lukewarm,"" he said. ""China is at best third, behind India and Japan,"" he added, citing meetings with fund managers in New York, Singapore, Hong Kong and Tokyo. India's stock market recently hit a record.
For sure, some hedge funds focused on China have been racking up big returns.
Hong Kong-based Quam Asset Management runs a fund that bets on stocks of Chinese companies--a ""long-short"" fund, meaning in some cases it bets on a rise, in others on a fall. It was up 13.2% through March 31, edging the MSCI China's 13.1% over the same period, making it the best-performing China-focused hedge fund and second- best overall among 473 alternative-asset managers ranked weekly by HSBC.
Most of the $58 million fund's returns came from fast-growing Chinese stocks such as internet company Tencent, iPhone-camera supplier Sunny Optical Technology Group and online-travel leader Ctrip.com International, according to portfolio manager Jim Fong, who argues that this year's rally is unlike the one two years ago, when China stocks soared into June and then collapsed.
""This time, the share-price gains are not as irrational as last time,"" he said. ""The economic data is not bad, and commodity prices have increased compared to last year.""
Some 90% of China funds employ variations on the same long-short equity strategy, and most tend to bet stocks will rise, said Mohammad Hassan, head analyst for hedge fund research and indexation at EurekaHedge. They are hamstrung by a lack of tools to hedge risk--especially in the yuan--by China's heavily managed capital markets.
""A lot of these guys sink when the market does,"" he said. Despite the gains this year, the potential for a trade war in Asia is still discouraging investment in China-focused funds. ""A lot of people still want to see how the U.S. and China will move forward,"" Mr. Hassan added.
That tendency has resulted in many China hedge funds clustering around the same high-performing stocks, a trade that fund managers said could prove vulnerable to reversal.
""We're starting to see a little bit of crowding in terms of themes like the new economy,"" said Adolfo Oliete, head of Asia Pacific investments at UBS Hedge Fund Solutions, whose $36 billion in assets makes it the world's second- biggest fund-of-hedge-funds manager, according to Hedge Fund Intelligence. Technology, media and telecoms

stocks and Macau gambling were other sectors that were also becoming hot, he added.
Even if many people were too bearish on China before, Mr. Oliete added, it is possible now to be too bullish--despite the improvement in the broader economy.

Don't Expect Swift Action From the Market Cops
President Donald Trump's picks to head the two top U.S. market cops--Jay Clayton at the Securities and Exchange Commission and J. Christopher Giancarlo at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission--are widely expected to win Senate confirmation by summer. Yet the slow pace to fill the other vacancies at the agencies means they are unlikely to be fully staffed until late 2017, at the earliest.
That's a blow to the Trump administration's goals of quickly easing or dismantling rules adopted in the wake of the financial crisis. These include SEC measures Republican critics deride as needlessly burdensome or otherwise unnecessary, such as requirements that companies disclose the pay gap between CEOs and their employees. At the CFTC, the effort includes rolling back swaps trading rules that Mr. Giancarlo maintains aren't sufficiently flexible for Wall Street.
Though the acting SEC chairman, Republican Michael Piwowar, has gotten the ball rolling on easing the CEO-pay
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 494 of 1177
rule, Mr. Clayton, who is a political independent, simply won't have the votes to relax such regulations until the SEC returns to four or five commissioners.
Currently, the SEC is operating with only two members--Mr. Piwowar and Kara Stein, a Democrat. Even with Mr. Clayton aboard, the SEC's quorum requirements would hand Ms. Stein veto power over virtually any commission action she doesn't support. By simply not showing up, she would be able to block the commission from voting by depriving Mr. Clayton of a quorum .
Similarly, Mr. Giancarlo can't advance the big pieces of his agenda until his commission is closer to full strength as Sharon Bowen, his Democratic counterpart, is unlikely to back efforts to ease regulation of banks and financial firms overseen by the agency.
These dynamics will change when both commissions regain members, but it's unclear when exactly that will happen. White House personnel and Senate aides are interviewing candidates to fill the remaining SEC and CFTC vacancies, according to people familiar with the matter, but the administration is unlikely to tap any nominees for several weeks. For the SEC picks, the White House will probably wait until after Mr. Clayton is confirmed and has a chance to personally meet--and potentially veto--prospective commissioners, according to Senate staff familiar with the deliberations. That likely won't occur for another month, these people said.
A pair of academics tapped for the SEC slots during the Obama administration--Hester Peirce, a Republican at the Mercatus Center, and Lisa Fairfax, a Democrat at George Washington University Law School--aren't expected to be renominated , according to people familiar with White House's thinking.
But the White is considering renominating Brian Quintenz for a Republican CFTC slot, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday . It's unclear if he will again be paired with Chris Brummer, a Democrat. Both were nominated a year ago but didn't receive a confirmation vote in the Senate.
The upshot of all of this? Don't expect any big deregulatory steps out of the SEC and CFTC, at least not in the first several months of the Clayton and Giancarlo chairmanships.
Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond Elizabeth Warren on Why She Didn't Run for President
By Byron Tau
WASHINGTON--Sen. Elizabeth Warren opted not to run for president in 2016 in part because her husband warned her the race would be far more grueling than her 2012 Senate bid, she writes in a book scheduled for release next week.
Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, progressive favorite and possible contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, recounts asking her husband, Bruce Mann, if she should enter the presidential fray in her new book, ""This Fight Is Our Fight.""
By early 2015, progressives in the Democratic Party were eager for an alternative to Hillary Clinton. Ms. Warren had become a heroine to that wing of the party through her work on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and her aggressive hearing-room challenges of banking regulators and financial executives.

Ms. Warren, 67 years old, recounts her husband was supportive of her but added that ""a race like this one looks pretty terrible. The Senate thing was bad enough, and running for president would be worse--a lot worse.'""
Her husband ultimately gave his blessing to a 2016 presidential bid, though Ms. Warren writes, ""Talking with Bruce and asking the question out loud had settled it. I wanted to stay buckled down and keep doing my job--my Senate job--as completely and as effectively as I could.""
Ms. Warren's book--in which she reveals for the first time she considered a White House run--combines biography and economic commentary. She argues that inadequate regulation of big banks and corporations has exacerbated income inequality and diminished the middle class.
Political biographies are often a prelude to a run for higher office--an opportunity for ambitious politicians to lay out a vision for the country. Mrs. Clinton published ""Hard Choices"" about 10 months before declaring herself a 2016 presidential candidate, while GOP presidential candidates Marco Rubio, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina also published books before launching White House bids. Barack Obama published a memoir and a political tract before running for president in 2008.
""Biographies are a tried and true way for politicians to tell their story, connect directly with supporters and expand their base,"" said Michael Czin, a Democratic consultant. ""Even if you take the actual book out of the equation, the tour and accompanying publicity is an important bully pulpit.""
The book will be published Tuesday by Metropolitan Books, an imprint of Henry Holt and Co. A copy was obtained by America Rising, a conservative research group, and viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Ms. Warren's Senate office and Henry Holt didn't respond to requests for comment.
Ms. Warren first rose to prominence as a law professor, bankruptcy expert and consumer advocate. Now vice chairwoman of the Senate Democratic caucus, she is routinely discussed as a potential Democratic candidate in 2020 or beyond.
In Ms. Warren's hard-fought 2012 Senate race, her opponent was Scott Brown, a Massachusetts Republican senator who ran as an everyman and referred to her as ""Professor Warren,"" an attempt to denigrate her background as a Harvard Law School faculty member.
The race also saw a controversy over allegations that Ms. Warren had claimed distant Cherokee heritage to gain an advantage in academic hiring. Ms. Warren has described herself as ""proud"" of her Native American heritage, which she says was passed down in family lore for generations. She won by about 8 percentage points.
After taking office, Ms. Warren said flatly she wouldn't run for president in 2016 and pledged to serve out the remainder of her Senate term.
Though she is most critical of the conservative push for deregulation and limited government, Ms. Warren also at times criticizes fellow Democrats in the book--including former presidents Mr. Obama and Bill Clinton. She positions herself in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, a faction that routinely reproaches elements of the party deemed too close to big business.
For example, she criticizes Mr. Obama's statement last year that ""the system isn't as rigged as you think.""
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 496 of 1177

""No, President Obama, the system is as rigged as you think,"" she writes in the book.
She also recounts that, anticipating Mrs. Clinton would win the 2016 election, she wrote a critical op-ed article for the New York Times in which she ""pushed hard on President-elect Clinton, urging her to make our government work for the American people.""
Ms. Warren wrote that she was under a great deal of pressure to endorse a candidate in the 2016 Democratic primary race but backed Mrs. Clinton only after she had sewn up the nomination. Mrs. Clinton considered her for vice president.
Though she stayed neutral in the primaries, Ms. Warren heaps praise on Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Democratic candidate whose message resonated strongly with many liberal voters. She describes him as ""passionate"" ""smart"" and ""totally committed."" ""I was reminded why we had been friends for so many years,"" she wrote.
BlackRock's Fink Takes a 2% Pay Cut By Sarah Krouse
The board of BlackRock Inc., the world's largest asset manager, cut Chief Executive Laurence Fink's pay by 2%, a sign of how even the best-performing money managers aren't immune from turmoil in their industry.
Mr. Fink earned $25.5 million in total compensation for his 2016 performance, down from $26 million the prior year, according to a regulatory filing Thursday.
The last time Mr. Fink's compensation dropped was in 2011. For 2016 he was awarded an $8 million cash bonus and stock compensation of $16.6 million, according to the filing. His base salary was $900,000, the same as 2015.
Executive pay is receiving increased scrutiny at money management firms as traditional stock and bond pickers face competitive pressure from the popularity of lower-cost index-tracking funds. A prolonged period of ultralow interest rates has also contributed to performance problems.
Even large firms like BlackRock that performed better than most are experiencing challenges. The $5.1 trillion asset manager pulled in record new cash from investors last year largely because of its large iShares exchange- traded fund unit, while its stock rose 12%. But the filing from the company Thursday also noted that revenue and diluted earnings per share declined 2% respectively.
""Boards are going to be very hard pressed to increase the total compensation level,"" for CEOs of most asset managers, said Chad Astmann, head of the North America asset management practice at executive search firm Heidrick &Struggles International Inc. The industry will be ""going through much more of a scrutinized perk and benefit package period. No question about it.""
Compensation for leaders of other money managers fell in 2016. One, Franklin Resources Inc., knocked down the compensation of Chief Gregory Johnson 21% for the 2016 fiscal year, to $10.1 million. His base pay and performance-based long-term incentive award remained the same, but the amount he was paid through a key executive incentive plan declined.

During the firm's fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, 2016, shares fell about 12%. It ended the year with $733.2 billion in assets under management, a roughly 5% year-over-year decline.
At Waddell &Reed Financial Inc., longtime Chief Henry Herrmann retired in August and the firm subsequently lowered its CEO compensation. It cut the base salary for its CEO to $725,000 from $1 million and eliminated some additional retirement benefits and a split-dollar life insurance policy.
Waddell's stock dropped 32% in 2016 and assets under management were $80.5 billion, down from $104.4 billion a year earlier.
While the asset management industry still has thicker margins than many others, according to Craig Siegenthaler, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, fee pressure and underperformance for some firms is likely to have a bigger impact on executive compensation. ""You'll see some of that this year and into next year,"" he said.
T. Rowe Price, another firm that tries to beat the market by handpicking securities, began giving top executives performance-based restricted stock units in 2016, rather than stock options. It said in a regulatory filing that the move better aligns pay with longer-term shareholder interests.
The Baltimore money manager ended 2016 with $810.8 billion in assets, up from $763.1 billion at the end of the prior year, and shares in the firm rose 5% during the year.
Not all firms have reduced pay at the top. J.P. Morgan Asset Management Chief Mary Callahan Erdoes earned $19 million last year, up from $18 million in 2015.
The company said in a regulatory filing that Ms. Erdoes had helped the unit deliver ""strong financial performance in a challenging market environment.""
WSJ Pro: CFPB Proposes Tweak to Mortgage Rule By Yuka Hayashi
WASHINGTON--The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Thursday proposed minor changes to a new mortgage-disclosure rule after banks voiced concerns that it would significantly add to their compliance burden.
The rule, which is tied to the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory-overhaul law passed after the financial crisis, represents an update to the 1975 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which required lenders to report more information about their home-loan customers.
The goal of the new rule is to help the public and regulators determine whether financial companies are serving communities' housing needs, and to identify possible discriminatory-lending practices, the CFPB said.
Most of the new rule's requirements are scheduled to take effect in January.
Thursday's proposal contains ""a number of clarifications, technical corrections and minor changes"" to the rule, the CFPB said, including clarifying key terms like ""temporary financing"" and ""automated underwriting system."" Also proposed was a change to facilitate reporting the census tract of a property using a new online geocoding tool.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 498 of 1177

Transition rules were also introduced for reporting certain loans purchased by financial institutions. Some lenders said the changes proposed Thursday weren't sufficient.
""The rule still represents a huge regulatory burden for credit unions,"" Dan Berger, chief executive of the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions, said in a statement. He said the trade group ""strongly encourages"" the bureau to reconsider its expansion of the data-collection set, raise the exemption thresholds and delay implementation of the rule to give lenders more time to prepare.
The public now has 30 days to comment on the proposal.
WSJ Pro: Fed Sent More Dollars to Foreign Banks, Report Shows
By Katy Burne
Foreign commercial banks are increasingly obtaining U.S. dollars indirectly from the Federal Reserve to meet their funding needs, new central-bank materials show.
The annual report for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, released Thursday, says it accounted for $1.8 billion of such dollar funding arrangements last year, up from $321 million in 2015.
The arrangements are known as ""liquidity swaps"" because currency is exchanged between the world's largest central banks to meet the funding needs of banks in those regions, when other sources dry up or become too expensive.
The data show there was a greater demand for dollars at foreign commercial banks over recent months, prompting them to tap central banks. The increase ""would indicate there is a shortage of dollars,"" said Tim Duy, economics professor at the University of Oregon. But ""the numbers aren't that big,"" he said.
Some analysts attributed the recent dollar shortage to new regulations governing U.S. money-market funds. A certain category, called ""prime"" money funds, previously invested heavily in the commercial paper and other short- term debt issued by commercial banks around the world, but, because of the regulatory changes, have dialed back those investments over the past 18 months. Some converted into government-only funds, investing in U.S. Treasurys.
Foreign commercial banks, feeling the pinch from the loss of that funding, have started to tap central banks for dollars, notably over recent quarter-end dates when banks need to show sufficient cash to meet regulatory requirements.
""The levels are extremely modest compared to what we saw when there were persistent funding strains in the market in the [2008 financial] crisis,"" said Lou Crandall, economist at researcher Wrightson ICAP. ""But with less funding available from prime funds, a little more [demand for dollars] spilled over to central banks over quarter ends.""
The New York Fed is authorized by the U.S. central bank to maintain dollars for use in the reciprocal arrangements with the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank and others.

Under the temporary arrangements, foreign central banks pass the dollars onto banks in their jurisdiction. The foreign central banks then return dollars to the Fed on a future date at the same exchange rate as the initial transaction.
Federal Home Loan Bank Settles Lehman Lawsuit for $70 Million By Patrick Fitzgerald
The Federal Home Loan Bank of New York has agreed to pay $70 million to the remnants of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. to settle a lawsuit over soured interest-rate swaps.
The Federal Home Loan Bank, or FHLBNY, announced the settlement in a regulatory filing Wednesday as a trial on the dispute was under way in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.
Lehman and its Special Financing unit sued FHLBNY in 2015 for more than $150 million it said it was owed from its position on 356 swaps and options transactions. Lehman said it was in the money on the swaps at the time of its 2008 bankruptcy filing.
A Lehman spokeswoman declined to comment. A bank representative declined to comment.
Although Lehman officially exited bankruptcy protection in 2012, its derivatives team is still wrangling with creditors over billions of dollars in disputed claims. Swaps and other derivatives represent a significant source of cash for Lehman creditors waiting to be paid more than eight years after the investment bank filed for bankruptcy protection.
FHLBNY is one of 11 regional home loan banks, which are cooperatives chartered by Congress and owned by more than 8,000 banks, thrifts, credit unions and insurers. They make loans, backed by home mortgages and other collateral, to their owners.
The bank used the swaps with Lehman as a hedge against rising interest rates with the bank paying a fixed rate to Lehman and the investment bank paying a floating rate. If rates fell, Lehman was in the money.
Lehman's chapter 11 filing on the morning of Sept. 15, 2008, froze financial markets and constituted an ""event of default"" that triggered the termination of millions of derivatives transactions involving the investment bank. Three days later on Sept. 18, FHLBNY terminated its swaps with a notional amount of $16.5 billion with the bankrupt investment bank.
Because of fluctuations in interest-rates markets after Lehman filed for bankruptcy, FHLBNY went back and ""cherry picked"" other termination dates, Lehman's lawsuit alleged, leading the bank ""to massively understate"" what it owed Lehman.
Lehman, once the world's fourth-largest investment bank, was a party to or had guaranteed over 10,000 derivative contracts representing more than 1.7 million transactions at the time of its collapse, according to court documents. The team working on unwinding the deals has so far recovered billions in cash for the benefit of creditors.
Bankruptcy professionals under the direction of Alvarez &Marsal Inc. managed the New York holding company's

assets until Lehman's exit from chapter 11 more than five years ago, when a reorganized company, overseen by a new board of directors, emerged. Lehman Holdings and its subsidiaries have already returned about $116 billion to creditors.

These Are the World's Biggest Banks (Hint: U.S. Doesn't Crack the Top Five) By Ben Eisen
The world may be focusing on three of the biggest U.S. banks on Thursday as they report earnings for the first three months of the year, but none of them even crack the top five in a global ranking of total assets.
The top four spots go to banks in China, led by the Industrial &Commercial Bank of China, with $3.5 trillion in total assets at the end of 2016, according to the latest report from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Number five is Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, based in Japan, with $2.6 trillion.
Among the banks that reported earnings Thursday, J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. comes in sixth, with $2.5 trillion, and Wells Fargo &Co. is 10th, with $1.9 trillion. Citigroup comes in 13th with $1.8 trillion.
Among the other big U.S. banks, Bank of America Corp. ranked no. 9, with $2.2 trillion in assets, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was 32nd, with $860 billion and Morgan Stanley was 37th,with $814 billion.
The order of the top five banks didn't change from S&P's previous ranking last year. But some of the big European banks moved down the list, due to a drop in the value of the euro and the British pound against the dollar, which affected the conversion rate. U.K.-based HSBC, with $2.4 trillion, moved from sixth to seventh, while French bank Credit Agricole Group dropped to 11th, from 10th, with $1.8 trillion.
In terms of calculations, S&P notes that the analysis adjusts assets for mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, including deals that closed as recently as March 31 of this year. For banks that reported assets in other currencies, conversions to dollars were done as of Dec. 31, 2016.
Wall Street's Outlook on the Economy Dims
By Ben Eisen
Bank analysts dimmed their outlook on business conditions this month, even as other measures of sentiment remained elevated, another sign of how Wall Street's outlook on the economy is diverging from Main Street's.
Morgan Stanley Business Conditions Index, based on a survey of the lender's research analysts, dropped to a reading of 56 in April, a level last seen in October before the presidential election pushed it up sharply. The index climbed to as high as 71 in December amid broad economic euphoria, but has since trended lower. It's been led most recently by lagging sentiment about manufacturing industries.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 501 of 1177

Readings above 50 still suggest the analysts see conditions improving, but the drop back to the index's post- recession average suggests they are losing confidence that the new presidential administration will usher in a new era of rapid economic growth.
It's an interesting reading in part because broad surveys of business sentiment are still near their peaks. A small business survey by the National Federal of Independent Business, for example, showed on Tuesday that although optimism edged down in March, it was well above where it was prior to the election. Companies themselves seem pretty optimistic about the economy, economists say.
""The signals from the larger manufacturing companies remain strong, partly reflecting an improvement in the global outlook,"" said Ulrik H. Bie, chief economist for global macro at the Institute of International Finance, in a report published this week.
Consumers are also feeling good. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge climbed in April, marking a rise of more than 10% from a year ago.
The climb in the survey-based sentiment readings started after the presidential election, with many respondents indicating that they believed the new administration's focus on tax cuts, deregulation, and reforming fiscal policies would kick the economy into a higher gear.
The high level of optimism in surveys caught the attention of economists, who saw ""soft"" readings on sentiment getting ahead of ""hard"" readings on actual economic growth. Morgan Stanley's economists said last month that the gap between the two sets of data has never been wider.
But the bank's business conditions survey is a sign that the sentiment has already turned on Wall Street. Other measures of how investors view the market have softened as well. In late November, 50% of individual investors said they were bullish on stocks, according to a weekly survey by the America Association of Individual Investors. But that's since fallen to 29% as bearishness has ramped up. Plus, the post-election rally in stocks has been showing signs of stalling out, another shifting barometer of sentiment.
Now, the question is whether Wall Street or Main Street is right.
How China's Crusade to Prop Up the Yuan Imperils Other Pressing Mandates By Lingling Wei
BEIJING--President Xi Jinping gathered with his economic mandarins in December for their annual strategy meeting at a heavily guarded government hotel. In closed-door sessions, say people familiar with the confab, he made clear what their mandate was for 2017: He would tolerate no wobbliness in the economy.
The communique? coming out of the session singled out one policy objective in particular--keep the yuan stable.
What followed has been the marked acceleration of a shift in priorities at the People's Bank of China, the central bank, toward preventing the currency from cratering above all else.
The yuan's value is a global hot button, and Beijing's handling of it has played prominently in President Donald Trump's rhetoric. In a Wall Street Journal interview Wednesday, Mr. Trump said his administration in a report due
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 502 of 1177

this week won't label China a currency manipulator, something he threatened to do during his campaign.
On Thursday, China's central bank guided the yuan to its biggest one-day gain against the dollar in nearly three months, putting it at the strongest level against the dollar since Feb. 17. The yuan has gained 1% this year against the dollar.
No matter how its moves are perceived, China's laser focus on slowing the yuan's decline is an issue of great significance to the world economy. If the PBOC's aggressive approach shortchanges traditional central-banking mandates, it could imperil China's economic growth, say many economists, including Yu Yongding, a senior economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government think tank.
Mr. Yu, a former adviser to the central bank, says the bank's emphasis on propping up the yuan has constrained its ability to fight other economic ills such as persistent housing bubbles. ""The issue of the exchange rate,"" he says, ""has become shackles on policy makers' ability to take other necessary actions.""
Simply put, China's currency-first policy is risky because the country now faces what economists call the ""trilemma,"" the theory that a country can't at once have a controlled exchange rate, free capital flow and independent monetary policy.
The PBOC had been preoccupied with the yuan's downward slope for 21?2 years, spending close to $1 trillion to keep it from weakening too fast. In 2016, though, the falling yuan was continuing to motivate Chinese to send money overseas and was eroding faith in China's economic management.
Going into 2017, a year that for Mr. Xi is all about launching his second term, Beijing concluded the PBOC had to go a step further and put the yuan's defense at the central bank's center stage, government officials and advisers say. Since December, the PBOC has strengthened limits on the ability of businesses and individuals to send money abroad, while raising short-term interest rates.
A PBOC press official said the central bank declined to comment. 'Impossible trinity'
For most of the past decade, Beijing seemed to defy the trilemma, or ""impossible trinity,"" as some call it, as it slowly lifted capital controls without the yuan or interest rates spinning out of control. ""You can have a combination of all three,"" Yi Gang, a deputy central-bank governor, said last year in a panel discussion with former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.
The PBOC has backed off that notion.
By tightening controls on money flowing out, it has dialed back years of efforts to make it easier for the Chinese to invest overseas and more attractive for foreigners to invest in China.
And the bank has essentially sidelined its traditional monetary-policy role because it must now consider the effect on the yuan before providing banks with more funds, government advisers say. The PBOC has tightened its hold on credit since December to reduce pressure for capital outflows.
That tightening might help prod some businesses to cut back on excessive borrowing--a stated government goal.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 503 of 1177

But it is also creating unintended stresses, including heightened risks of a full-blown cash squeeze in the financial system, says Zhu Chaoping, China economist at UOB Kay Hian Holdings Ltd. , a Singapore investment bank. ""The PBOC is between a rock and a hard place.""
Beijing's 2017 yuan defense harks to 2014. For years, China bought dollars and sold yuan, drawing Western criticism that it kept its currency undervalued to promote Chinese exports--a cheaper yuan meant lower dollar prices for its products.
In the summer of that year, it shifted course. After years of growth, when money was pouring in, the slowing economy was driving cash away, and the PBOC sold dollars to prop up the yuan. Since then, the PBOC has spent $1 trillion, a quarter of its currency reserves, to control the yuan's fall.
When dollar selling wasn't enough, it added stricter capital controls and other measures over the following years, while publicly repeating a mantra that the yuan was returning to normalcy.
Adding to China's motivations has been the Trump factor. As a candidate, Mr. Trump accused China of becoming the world's leading exporter--and destroyer of American jobs--by exploiting an artificially weak yuan. Beijing hopes its yuan defense will reduce the chance of a trade war that could hurt exports and sour relations with the U.S., Chinese officials say.
""The higher-ups don't want the exchange rate to become a trouble spot,"" with the U.S. as well as in China, says an official who attended the December meeting.
Mr. Trump's pronouncement Wednesday takes some pressure off Beijing. The U.S. Treasury Department this week is expected to issue its semiannual report on the currency practices of America's major trading partners. Mr. Trump in the Journal interview said the report won't call China a currency manipulator, saying China has stopped manipulating the yuan and that it was more important to focus on cooperation with Beijing on North Korea.
At a news briefing Thursday, a Chinese foreign-ministry spokesman said: ""It's true that China hasn't been a currency manipulator--that's an objective fact.""
Government officials and economists in Beijing on Thursday said they expect Washington to continue putting China on notice about currency management and trade practices. Official data released Thursday showed China's trade surplus was $23.93 billion in March, compared with a rare deficit of $9.15 billion in the previous month, and 74% of the latest surplus was with the U.S.
China isn't seeking to stop the yuan's fall altogether, but to guide it lower in an orderly fashion. Too sharp a drop could drive up inflation by increasing import costs and cause uncontrollable capital flight--battering confidence in the Communist Party.
A weaker yuan also makes it harder for Chinese companies, from state banks to airlines, to service their more-than- $1 trillion foreign debt. Such companies draw most of their revenue from domestic businesses, and a weakening Chinese currency requires them to expend more yuan to pay off the same amount of dollar debt.
Chinese airlines, for example, have been trying to pare the huge dollar debts they racked up in years when the yuan was strong, mostly to buy planes from Boeing Co. and Airbus SE.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 504 of 1177

Pressure to service that now-pricier debt could force them to cut back domestic investment and jobs, and threaten them with insolvency. That could propel even more outflows, further weakening the currency, said Sheng Songcheng, a senior adviser at the PBOC, in a December interview. The potential for that type of negative-feedback loop, he said, makes stabilizing expectations for the yuan an ""urgent task.""
Beijing's moves to stabilize the yuan, though, threaten its financial stability elsewhere--the consequences of the trilemma.
The PBOC's moves since December to add new barriers to capital outflows have given many foreign investors pause. ""We have to be sure that if we put money in, we can take it out,"" says David Loevinger, a managing director at Los Angeles-b"

When it comes to investment banking, the first quarter of 2017 isn't turning out as advertised.
Given the dire start to 2016 and the tidal wave of positive sentiment after Donald Trump's Presidential victory, the signs were that a great rebound was coming. But with the big five U.S. banks and four of Europe's largest having reported, the revenue recovery doesn't look as strong as investors might have hoped.
All together, total revenues in dollar terms for these big banks is only about 13% higher than the first quarter last year. That includes fixed-income and equities trading, along with fees for capital and fundraising, some lending and advising on deals.
To give that some context, look at just how bad the start of 2016 was: Total revenues from the world's 12 largest investment banks in last year's first quarter were 25% down on the same period in 2015, according to the research group Coalition.
The recovery has been unevenly spread: Morgan Stanley and Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch saw the strongest total revenue growth across these businesses year-over-year in the U.S. and indeed globally.
In Europe, Credit Suisse has done best so far in dollar terms followed by its crosstown rival UBS, but their pace of growth lagged far behind all U.S. rivals except Goldman Sachs. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank and Barclays went backwards with the latter performing worst.
European investment banks do business in multiple currencies all over the world, so converting reported revenues into dollars might not exactly reflect the state of their business. But the dollar is the major currency for global markets, and the U.S. is the world's biggest capital market, so it is likely a better guide than euros or British pounds.
BNP Paribas, HSBC and Socie?te? Ge?ne?rale are due to report this week and could improve the European picture overall, but as things stand it looks as if Europeans are continuing to lose ground to their larger American rivals. Despite hopes that normalization of central bank monetary policies might spur more variety in market performance and so more active trading and fund management, volatility so far remains low in many assets. There are few signs yet that investment banking will get to see the kind of revenues they saw in the past this year--or perhaps ever.
There is no sense in trying to be number one for its own sake. Banks should focus on making decent profits, as the head of one European bank put it last week. Right now, however, most European banks appear to be losing share or struggling to make any money --or both. That isn't a good advertisement for anything.

HSBC,HSBC Receives First Dividend From U.S. Unit in More Than a Decade; Lender posts better-than-expected net profit," May 4, 2017",1,"LONDON--HSBC Holdings PLC on Thursday said it took its first dividend since 2006 from its U.S. bank in April, a milestone in the lender's yearslong turnaround.
The release of capital--an unspecified amount--and better-than-expected first-quarter profit at the bank raised expectations HSBC could buy back more shares after eschewing investment to spend $3.5 billion on buybacks in the past year.
HSBC shares were up 3.6% in afternoon London trading. However, Finance Director Iain Mackay said in an interview that the lender will hold off on further buybacks in the near term.
The dividend payment is a symbolic step in the lender's restructuring program , which Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver launched in 2011 to refocus on Asia and scale back in places that were too risky or unprofitable, or where the bank was too small. Almost 100 businesses have been shut, including most of HSBC's operations in Latin America.
The moves have freed up capital for other investments, but a lack of opportunities led HSBC to buy back shares. Mr. Mackay told analysts the payment was the first step in releasing billions of dollars in capital ""trapped"" in HSBC's U.S. business. He declined to say how much had been paid out to the parent bank and a spokeswoman said the number wasn't currently being released. The dividend was anticipated since HSBC's North America holding company passed annual stress tests in July.
He said it could take three years or more to recoup surplus U.S. capital, which analysts estimate at $7 billion to $10 billion. HSBC has major banking operations in the U.S. but for years has been winding down the remnants of Household International Inc., the subprime lender it bought just a few years before the subprime-mortgage market crashed in 2007.
Mr. Mackay said a deferred prosecution agreement the bank entered with the Justice Department in 2012 could also ""reflect on the capital position.""
HSBC must raise its anti-money-laundering standards and meet other conditions to exit from the DPA, part of a settlement with U.S. authorities over allegations it failed to spot money laundering by criminal gangs and to flag transactions with countries under economic sanctions. HSBC admitted the wrongdoing.
The Asia-focused bank on Thursday reported first-quarter earnings that beat expectations with a $3.13 billion net profit and a small rise in revenue,
Net profit was down from $3.89 billion in the first quarter of 2016 but higher than the $2.67 billion analysts had estimated. Adjusted profit, stripping out one-time items and taxes, rose 12% to $5.94 billion, with gains across retail banking, commercial banking and global banking and markets.
Analysts are expecting up to another $2 billion in stock buybacks in the second half. Mr. Mackay in an interview said the bank wasn't making any commitments and would take ""a little pause"" for now on buybacks. The bank will take another look at the possibility after the second quarter, he said.
""Our preference will always be to invest capital for future growth,"" he said. He told analysts an expansion into China's Pearl River Delta region was starting to bear fruit.
The bank's overall Asia operations notched $4.31 billion in adjusted profit before tax, up 25% from a year earlier, helped by retail banking and wealth management and higher insurance sales.
In the U.K., a main market for the bank alongside Hong Kong, Mr. Mackay said loan demand from households and businesses is holding up despite uncertainty around the country's planned exit from the European Union .
""When you look at the economic numbers there may be some slowing, but that is not manifested in customer behavior at this point in time,"" Mr. Mackay said.
After the years of reorganizing, HSBC is now readying to change its top leadership. In March it said Mark Tucker,
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 516 of 1177

* HSBC Finds Success, but Not Where It Expected Credit: By Margot Patrick"
HSBC,"HSBC Finds Success, but Not Where It Expected; Boost from China's Pearl River Delta expansion proves slow flowing"," May 4, 2017",1,"
HSBC found some revenue growth--trouble is, it wasn't located where the bank went looking.
Underlying revenues across HSBC's businesses were up 9% in the first quarter of 2017 versus the start of 2016, driven by growth in retail banking and wealth management. Superficially that sounds well and good. However, profits were down, mainly due to higher restructuring spending this year and no gains from changes in the value of HSBC's debt.
Investors have been more focused on revenue, particularly regarding whether HSBC can ride the coat-tails of the young and expanding economy in the technology-and-export hub of Pearl River Delta in southern China. This is where the U.K.-listed, Asia-focused bank has said its investment efforts should find greatest reward.
The bank did highlight 17% loan growth in the Pearl River Delta, but without knowing the base level, it is hard to know what this did for revenues or assets.
Across Asia as a whole, net interest income was up 9%, helped by higher interest rates . Total Asian loans were up 6%, but mostly from corporate and commercial lending.
Meanwhile, most of the growth in retail revenues globally came from a more-than $300 million swing in insurance income. There was also stronger revenue from deposit accounts and investment product sales in Hong Kong. However, a big recovery in global fixed-income trading revenues delivered more than three times the revenue growth than the bank got from pure retail banking. Trading revenue isn't to be sniffed at, but it isn't what HSBC is most targeted at.
The bank added to its comfortable capital base, supporting the case for further share buybacks , especially once more capital is released from its U.S. arm later in 2017. The promise of plentiful payouts buoyed the stock, which rose about 4% in morning trade.
For now, HSBC is succeeding somewhat in spite of its aims.

HSBC,China Seals Record $43 Billion Foreign Takeover Deal but Work Remains; ChemChina faces challenges to complete takeover of Swiss agribusiness major Syngenta in China's largest overseas acquisition to date," May 5, 2017",0,"
China Inc. reached a new milestone in global acquisitions as shareholders of agro-giant Syngenta AG approved a $43 billion takeover by China National Chemical Corp., sealing the country's biggest foreign deal to date.
The hard work may just be beginning, however, as China National Chemical, known as ChemChina, faces a series of challenges ranging from financing the deal to fusing the Swiss company into its own operations.
""Life begins after closing,"" said Grace Fan-Delatour, a partner at law firm K&L Gates LLP, who advises state-owned Chinese companies on outbound investment and how to avoid the pitfalls that often bedevil big takeovers. ChemChina executives will have to manage a balancing act as they look to expand Syngenta's seed and pesticide

businesses in China's fragmented and inefficient agriculture sector while ensuring stability at the Swiss company's operations in the U.S. and around the world.
At the same time, state-owned ChemChina must attract new equity investment to help cover Syngenta's hefty price tag amid concerns over its debt levels.
Finally, more upheaval may be on the way: China's government is contemplating a merger of ChemChina with state-owned conglomerate Sinochem Group, according to two people familiar with the situation.
Both companies have previously denied reports of a planned tie-up. They didn't respond to requests for comment Friday, nor did China's State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, which is in charge of state-run companies.
In a joint statement, ChemChina and Syngenta on Friday said 80.7% of the Swiss company's shares were tendered for the deal, based on a preliminary count, well above the 67% minimum needed for approval. The companies said the first settlement payment was scheduled for May 18, when ChemChina would take control.
Syngenta closed at 459.2 Swiss francs ($465) a share Thursday, about 20% above the price before the deal was announced in February 2016 . ChemChina will also pay a special dividend of five Swiss francs a share immediately before the deal's closing.
As the deal's completion nears, China has signaled it remains willing to spend top dollar for prized overseas assets despite its concerns over capital outflows that are tamping down its overall global deals activity.
The transaction also portends a profound shift in the agriculture sector globally, with China set to play a greater role in U.S. and other countries' food supplies as it scoops up technologies for its own farms. It also comes against the backdrop of broad industry consolidation, which has triggered objections from farmers over less choice and potentially higher prices.
At its heart, however, the deal will help China modernize antiquated farming techniques that have made it increasingly reliant on imports to feed its population of 1.4 billion. Granting farmers access to more-advanced foreign technology--including genetically modified seeds developed by Syngenta and its competitors--is likely to be part of overhauls that aim to industrialize farming in China.
With few exceptions, genetically modified seeds aren't allowed in China. Industry observers say this deal is likely to help change that over the coming years.
For Ren Jianxin, ChemChina's chairman and founder, the acquisition solidifies his place as one of China's top deal makers , coming after a series of transactions including the takeover of Italian tire producer Pirelli &C. SpA. However, ChemChina might face further hurdles after its latest deal closes. Syngenta's net profit has fallen more than 25% over the past two years. The company has struggled with poor weather, exchange-rate volatility and deflationary forces that weakened crop prices--and reduced demand for its products.
""Syngenta was always, dare I say, viewed as the ugly stepchild of the industry,"" said Tyler Tebbs, an analyst who has followed the deal at brokerage firm Olivetree Financial Ltd.
While Mr. Ren has long been regarded as an aggressive mergers-and-acquisitions tactician, he is seen as less adept at staging a corporate turnaround. Success then may depend in part on selecting key ChemChina managers to lead the integration, industry analysts said.
Syngenta, for its part, has suggested ChemChina might take a hands-off approach to its operations, and has played up the expected long-term financial stability the takeover would bring to the company.
""Syngenta will stay Syngenta,"" Chief Executive Erik Fyrwald said in an interview after the release of the company's results on April 24, when it reported sales last quarter fell 1% from one year earlier, to $3.7 billion.
One main benefit, he said, was having a long-term oriented owner at a time when research-and-development cycles for crop-related investments can last up to 10 years, which shareholders with a shorter-term focus ""often don't have the patience for.""
The political and strategic considerations help to explain why this transaction has been greenlighted by China's government while other recent deals have sputtered amid tightened capital controls.
""The reality is this: When China wants to do a deal, it will get the deal done,"" said Hilary Lau, a partner who advises
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 522 of 1177

on Chinese deals for Herbert Smith Freehills LLP. Policy-driven deals ""remain to be done regardless of the price tag.""
The acquisition has been approved by regulators in the U.S., European Union, China and Mexico, among others. In India, a government spokesman Friday declined to comment on the status of approval there.
To win approval from the EU , ChemChina agreed to divest itself of a large part of its European business for pesticides and other products that regulate crop growth.
To pay for the deal, ChemChina obtained $50 billion in short-term loan facilities last year, according to U.S. securities filings by Syngenta. China Citic Bank International agreed to put up $30 billion, while HSBC, together with three other European lenders, agreed to provide $20 billion, according to the filings.
The M&A streak by ChemChina has led to warnings from credit-rating firms. Moody's Investors Service said in November it expected the acquisition of Syngenta to result in a pro forma ratio of debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization--an important indicator of a company's debt risk--of about 11.4 times, up from 8.6 times at the end of 2015. An investment-grade company's ratio is typically under three times, according to credit analysts.
Seeking to limit its exposure, ChemChina began reaching out last year to state funds, including China Reform Holdings, and the country's $40 billion Silk Road Fund, for equity investment, people familiar with the matter said previously. It also sought out private-equity firms and sovereign funds, these people said.
So far, the company has garnered a $5 billion equity investment from an arm of Citic Ltd., an affiliate to its financial adviser China Citic Bank.

At a Glance
* The Deal: ChemChina said shareholders of seed-and-agrochemical producer Syngenta approved its $43 billion acquisition offer. The deal would be China's biggest foreign takeover to date, and would give it control of advanced technologies to modernize its farms.
* The Challenges: Among the biggest include integrating Syngenta's global operations into the Chinese company, and analysts believe ChemChina will take a hands-off approach to managing Syngenta in the short-run. ChemChina still needs to secure fresh equity investment to help pay for the deal.
* What Comes Next: ChemChina is expected to take control of Syngenta May 18 after the first settlement payment, and the company says it is working to delist Syngenta's shares in Switzerland and New York.

HSBC,Goldman's Blankfein Warns on Brexit Risks to London; U.S. bank has a range of contingency plans in place to move staff out of the U.K.," May 5, 2017",0,"London's expansion as a financial center could ""stall"" and banks may need to consider moving staff out of the city because of Brexit, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has warned.
Lloyd Blankfein said the city is at risk of backtracking, but that the bank hopes to be able to continue to conduct its business as close as possible to the way it does now once the U.K. formally leaves the European Union.
""I don't think it will totally reverse,"" Mr. Blankfein said in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. published Friday. ""It will stall, it might backtrack a bit, it just depends on a lot of things about which we are uncertain and I know there isn't certainty at the moment.""
""If you cannot benefit from the access to the EU from the U.K... the risk is there will be some adjustment that will cause some people to have a smaller footprint in the U.K."" he said.
The U.S. bank, which employs around 6,000 people in London , has a range of contingency plans in place to move staff out of the U.K. and into other European cities including Paris, Dublin and Frankfurt if needed in the wake of Brexit. These include taking options on office space and studying the regulatory regimes in other European countries, Mr. Blankfein said. In terms of moving staff, he said the bank doesn't have ""big plans now.""
Mr. Blankfein didn't say how many staff could eventually move out of London, although the bank has previous indicated it would initially move hundreds of jobs to the EU.
However, the culture, language and ""special relationship"" between the U.K. and U.S. leaves Goldman eager to ""try to stay as close to home as possible,"" he said.
Mr. Blankfein called for a clear signal from the U.K. and EU on how a possible transitional period following Britain's exit from the bloc could work. Without this, he said, the bank may have to act on its plans to move staff ""prematurely.""
Banks and lobby groups have called for a transition period to help them prepare properly for new rules that will come into force following Brexit.
Major international banks, which have for years used London as a regional base, are beginning to flesh out their plans for their European operations once Britain's leaves the EU and its single market for services.
Mr. Blankfein's comments come the same week that it emerged that J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. plans to move between 500 and 1,000 jobs out of London as it implements its Brexit contingency plan. Morgan Stanley is also looking at cities including Dublin and Paris, The Wall Street Journal has reported, while HSBC Holdings PLC has previously indicated it may move around 1,000 staff to Paris.

HSBC,"Chinese Millennials--Already Big Homeowners--Use Apps to Snap Up Overseas Property; Young Chinese are buying real estate in other countries as hedge against a weakening currency, homes for their own children when they study abroad"," May 9, 2017",1,"BEIJING--Zheng Xiaohei, a marketer from Urumqi in western China, made his first overseas property investment without so much as a visit.
Mr. Zheng, 29 years old, in March purchased a studio apartment in Thailand for about 650,000 yuan ($94,255) using his smartphone and an app called Uoolu that connects users to overseas property listings.
""Investing in overseas real estate was mainly due to my good impression of Thailand,"" Mr. Zheng said.
Founded two years ago, Beijing-based Uoolu is focused on tapping a specific group of home buyers: Chinese millennials looking for foreign properties .
About 70% of Chinese millennials, those born between 1981 and 1998, own a home, the highest share of respondents from nine countries and regions who were surveyed in a recent HSBC study . Chinese parents often register home purchases under their child's name to prepare the child for marriage and raising a family, which likely boosts the percentage.
Still, a growing sliver of Chinese millennials are looking to buy property abroad. Kevin Lee, chief operating officer of Beijing-based consulting firm Youthology, put the percentage in the low single digits but said it would continue to increase.
The lure? A millennial's desire to hedge against yuan depreciation and find affordable homes in cities with cleaner air for their children to live in when they study abroad. In the past year, home prices have soared to more than 30 times household income in major Chinese cities.
Uoolu said about 80% of its monthly active users are between the ages of 20 and 39, and that 20,000 customers
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 530 of 1177
have bought or are in the process of purchasing overseas property. A similar real-estate platform, Juwai.com, estimates that roughly 30% to 40% of its buyers are millennials.
Cherubic Ventures, a venture-capital firm with offices in Beijing and San Francisco, invested an undisclosed sum in Uoolu. One selling point, said the firm's founder, Matt Cheng, was Uoolu's target of reaching young Chinese buyers who are tech savvy and interested in cross-border investments, ""but don't know where to begin.""
Overseas investing isn't easy at a time when the Chinese government is clamping down on capital flight amid concerns about a weakening currency. Chinese citizens aren't allowed to transfer more than $50,000 a year out of the country or use those funds to buy overseas property.
However, this increased government scrutiny is ""slowing but not cutting off"" the surge of investment in U.S. property, said Arthur Margon, partner at Rosen Consulting Group.
""The more the government limits people, the more they want to invest overseas,"" said Wang Hao, Uoolu's 33-year- old chief operating officer.
People often skirt the foreign-exchange rules by, for example, pooling money among family members and friends and separately sending it into overseas bank accounts. Also, Chinese citizens who have studied or worked abroad for a few years might already have bank accounts in other countries and those overseas funds are beyond the Chinese government's control.
Alan Wang, a 19-year-old college student in Toronto who comes from Shenzhen, said he opened a bank account in Canada for education expenses. Now it is useful for buying property, too. He and his family are thinking about purchasing a home on a budget of about 1 million Canadian dollars (US$730,600) this summer. To do so, he will have relatives send money to his bank account, he said.
Uoolu helps buyers open bank accounts in other countries and apply for mortgages there. Users pay a deposit to reserve the right to purchase a home. The money is sent directly from a buyer's bank account to the overseas developer--Uoolu says it doesn't handle the cross-border transaction within the mobile app.
Chris Daish, a real-estate agent at Triplemint in New York, said one of his Chinese clients, an accountant in her mid- 20s who works in New York, earlier this year pooled $110,000 from five family members to help buy her a condo in the city.
""It's a really arduous task even to get a couple hundred grand out,"" said Mr. Daish, who emphasized that he doesn't help clients with money transfers.
A 28-year-old who works in finance in Beijing in February bought two apartments in Bangkok for a total of 5 million yuan ($725,000), one for a vacation home and the other for rental income. She declined to disclose her name out of fear of government retaliation for violating capital controls.
As for some of her friends, she said, ""They wish to buy but dare not.""

HSBC,"Coke's New CEO James Quincey to Staff: Make Mistakes; 52-year-old Briton takes helm as world's largest beverage company faces shrinking soda consumption, outside calls for more cost-efficiency"," May 9, 2017",0,"ATLANTA--Coca-Cola Co.'s new chief executive wants the company to shake off a culture of cautiousness that has dogged the soda giant for more than a century.
Nicknamed the ""New Coke syndrome""--after the company's catastrophic 1985 decision to reformulate its namesake brand--that fear of failure is counterproductive at a time when Coca-Cola has to take more risks, James Quincey said in an interview this week at his office.
The 52-year-old Mr. Quincey, who succeeded Muhtar Kent as CEO on May 1 , is taking the helm at an existential moment for the world's largest beverage company. Fewer people are drinking soda. Sugary drinks are being slapped with taxes in the U.S., U.K. and beyond, as governments look to raise revenue and curb consumption of added sugar, which has been linked to diabetes and obesity. And while Coca-Cola has diversified into dairy, tea, bottled water and other beverages, 70% of its global sales by volume is still soda.
Mr. Quincey's answer: Coke must become a ""total beverage company."" And to do that, it must not be afraid to make mistakes, he said.
""I'm not sure fear of failure is entirely wrong, except when it leads to inaction,"" Mr. Quincey said, sipping occasionally from a bottle of smartwater, a brand the company acquired as part of a 2007 deal. ""If you're trying to do something different on Coke, failure is big and emblematic.""
Mr. Quincey said that because the company for much of its 131-year history has been focused on ""curating the world's most valuable brand, a lot of due attention and care was paid to any changes that were made.""
But on smaller, emerging brands, the company needs to be experimenting more, he said. ""If we're not making mistakes, we're not trying hard enough.""
Some company insiders and analysts say Coke should have moved sooner to address the sugar issue and adapt to shifting consumer tastes. At Mr. Quincey's urging, Coke in 2014 dropped its fight in the U.K. against voluntary health labels on its beverage packaging, which included a warning about high levels of sugar in its regular sodas. The company has begun promoting smaller package sizes and reformulating beverages to offer more low- and no- calorie options.
In the U.S., where consumers now drink more bottled water than soda , Coke is shifting from a volume-focused business to one in which it shares profit with its bottlers so it can sell smaller cans and bottles at higher prices. It is also in the process of selling off most of its bottling operations to focus on its more profitable concentrate business, a process that by next year will leave it with fewer than 40,000 global employees, down from 150,900 in 2012.
Mr. Quincey is cutting another 1,200 jobs, representing 20% of the company's corporate staff. And he is officially giving employees permission to say that Coke isn't their favorite brand in the company's portfolio, an admission that would have been blasphemous a year ago.
""If we are to be a total beverage company, it has to be OK for consumers to say something else is their favorite brand. Therefore, it has to be OK for an employee to say something else is their favorite brand,"" he said.
In 10 or 15 years, he said, soda could represent less than half of the company's global sales by volume, a shift he
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 533 of 1177
hopes to accelerate by investing more in upstarts and acquiring new brands.
Mr. Quincey was born and raised in the U.K. and studied electrical engineering at the University of Liverpool, then decided he was better at business than designing semiconductors. He joined Coke in 1996 and led operations in Latin America and Europe before being tapped in 2015 as chief operating officer and heir apparent to Mr. Kent.
Mr. Quincey cited a product stumble of his own, when rolling out a drink in Argentina in 2003 modeled on mate, a local herbal tea. It is traditionally made by filling a gourd with leaves and hot water and consumed in a group, with everyone drinking from the same straw. Coke's version, bottled and bubbly, missed the point, he said.
""The mistake that we made was not to understand why people drank it,"" Mr. Quincey said. ""It's about the social occasion.""
Coke is now under pressure to become more cost-efficient. Analysts have speculated that within a few years, it could be a takeover target of Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital Partners LP, whose founders are controlling shareholders in brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev NV. A 3G spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment. Improving efficiency will be ""a critical success factor"" for the soda giant, HSBC analyst Carlos Laboy said. ""Bottlers say head count is a problem at Coke. Too many people are doing the same redundant things.""
Of 3G, Mr. Quincey said: ""They're very clearly saying: We're setting a new benchmark as to what running an operation efficiently looks like. I think every company, including us and our bottling partners, we need to look at those benchmarks."" He added that Coke would aim to cut costs without sacrificing revenue growth.
As recently as 2015, Mr. Kent was doubling down on soda, a strategy that analysts say failed. Mr. Quincey rejects that conclusion.
""There's no road to the future without a successful red Coke,"" he said. ""We need to be growing the sparkling revenue and expanding our leadership in the other categories. You've got to do both. That's the only way forward."" Write to Jennifer Maloney at jennifer.maloney@wsj.com
In His Own Words
Mr. Quincey on whether a market leader can be a disrupter:
""The trap you fall into as a big company is you start... looking at the world through the lens of your existing business: How can I leverage what I've got to get more? But the way to avoid getting disrupted is to start with the consumer and say: What's actually happening out there?""
Mr. Quincey on eliminating the chief marketing officer role:
""We're trying to make a point, which is: The way brands are getting created today is not just... making ads that people love. It's through interaction directly with customers without advertising at all.""

Chinese investment banks so far in 2017 took five of the top 10 spots in league-table rankings for underwriting offshore Chinese debt deals, and they accounted for just under half of associated sales volume. That is up from one spot and 13% of associated volume in 2012, according to Dealogic.
Driving the gains is a battle for business by Chinese banks, which are willing to accept smaller profits than Western rivals, bankers say. The banks are bringing with them some nonstandard practices honed in China's famously bumpy home markets, some of which could lead to unruly trading in offshore markets as well, Wall Street bankers say.
After a recent government crackdown on runaway debt in China sent bond yields climbing, Chinese banks have also been pursuing companies rushing to sell bonds overseas. China's overall debt is now estimated to be almost triple gross domestic product, a level many experts view as dangerous. Bond yields rise as prices fall.

Historically, Western firms with connections and financial heft, including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and HSBC Holdings PLC, have had an advantage in helping Chinese companies tap global investors and financial markets despite China's regulations curbing foreign participation in onshore investment-banking and trading.
In recent years, though, big Chinese financial firms like China Construction Bank Corp. have piled into the business of advising on stock listings in the offshore market of Hong Kong.
The same thing has happened in Chinese dollar-bond underwriting, where fierce competition among Chinese banks has pushed the number of firms per deal to an average of 6.4 in 2017, more than double the average for 2011 and roughly triple the number involved in similar deals in the U.S., the U.K. or Germany, according to Dealogic. Some recent Chinese dollar deals have involved more than 20 banks, according to Dealogic.
The competition hits profits, bankers say. Chinese companies have paid $385 million in fees for underwriting their dollar-bond deals this year, second only to U.S. issuers, according to Dealogic. But fees on such deals for corporate clients were on average a little more than half of what they were for U.S. deals, Thomson Reuters data show.
Fees aren't distributed evenly among investment banks, as they tend to be in the U.S. or Europe, where orders go in a shared pool and other underwriters can see the names of investors in a bond issue and the amount they are buying.
In mainland as well as offshore Chinese bond deals, Chinese issuers urge banks to compete for fees, awarding the biggest amounts to those banks that snag the most investor orders. One way of amassing that business is through anonymous orders, known as ""x-account orders,"" that are credited to the bank that receives them.
The use of x-orders is now relatively rare in most other markets around the globe, bankers say. Decades ago, bankers in the U.S. and Europe shifted to a more transparent system, arguing that it ensures a steady and diverse base of investors and helps the bonds trade smoothly.
Some investors say they like x-orders because the anonymity lets them preserve relationships with their favorite banks without offending others on the deal. Many Chinese banks say x-orders help them show their corporate clients--particularly newcomers to dollar-bond issuance--that they are earning their fees.
Bankers say x-orders are common in Chinese offshore deals and can represent as much as 75% of orders.
""The more account x's...you can potentially get more fees,"" said one debt-capital markets manager at a big Chinese bank. ""This is definitely an incentive.""
Some global banks say they are uncomfortable with anonymous orders and have walked away from deals involving them. Other Western bankers say they feel pressure to place x-orders to keep a top spot in the bond- underwriting league tables--an important factor when pitching new business.
One challenge is that investors sometimes place duplicate x-orders with multiple banks to make sure they can get all the bonds they want to buy, which can make demand seem larger than it really is, bankers say.
Last year, China Cinda Asset Management Co. enlisted 23 banks to ensure the smooth launch of a dollar- denominated bond it was using to bolster capital. Cinda initially aimed to raise as much as $4.45 billion. Bankers on the deal say orders, mostly anonymous, at one point were thought to total about $10 billion. By the time pricing was finished and all the orders reconciled, the value had shrunk to $3.2 billion.
Cinda didn't respond to requests for comment.
X-orders also make it impossible to know whether investors are stable long-term holders or fast-trading hedge funds--and thus, how the bonds will trade.
""That's one of the reasons we're not buying"" Chinese U.S. dollar bonds, said Jan Dehn, head of research at fund manager Ashmore Group in London. ""As soon as momentum weakens, all these overvalued bonds are in the hands of investors who flip them.""
Many Chinese banks use their big stores of cash to buy into the bond deals they are arranging--something their relatively lean Western counterparts can't do. Chinese bankers say the practice encourages other investors to pile in and ensure the fundraising goes smoothly. Western bankers say their rivals are placing these orders to secure

business from the issuer, and that the practice limits the number of bonds going to other investors.
Chinese banks issuing bonds outside the mainland are ""importing book-building practices from the onshore market that tend to conflict with the typical collaborative international approach,"" said one senior debt-capital- markets banker at a big Western firm in Hong Kong.

HSBC,JD.com Closes In on Alibaba," May 15, 2017",0,"IN THE BATTLE OF CHINA'S E-COMMERCE TITANS, JD.COM JUST fired a shot across the bow of rival Alibaba Group Holding.
JD.com (ticker: JD) is a distant No. 2 in online retailing in the world's second-biggest economy. It sells about $95 billion a year in goods online, compared to Alibaba's $450 billion. But it is working hard to close that gap. In May JD.com turned in its first quarterly profit since going public three years ago, reporting net income of $35 million. Analysts had been bracing for a roughly $125 million loss. The big swing was backed by robust sales of electronics and home appliances, and rising orders via smartphones. As everyday Chinese become wealthier, they're more frequently replacing, or upgrading, these sorts of goods. This arguably benefits JD.com more than Alibaba (BABA), as Chinese consumers are wary of counterfeit goods sold over Alibaba's shopping platforms.
Traders have bid up JD.com's New York-listed American depositary receipts almost 10% since the earnings report. ""JD.com had a great quarter,"" says Kevin Carter, founder of the EMQQ Emerging Markets Internet&Ecommerce exchange- traded fund (EMQQ). He tells Barron's the most impressive facet was the company's 40% spike in new users. He reckons the stock has further upside, thanks to its finance arm, which it plans to spin offin a separate public offering. JD.com wants to plow the returns from that listing back into its logistical networks, which will eventually use drone technology to make deliveries.
It's hard to overstate how crucial delivery networks are in the race for Chinese e-commerce supremacy: In a vast emerging market that's home to 1.3 billion consumers, being as close as possible to your customers is a key strategic advantage. Carter adds that while Alibaba remains bigger and more profitable, JD.com will gain ground. Investors appear to agree: Shares in Beijing-based JD.com have returned a staggering 55% since the start of the year, compared to 18% for the MSCI China Index.
Analysts see plenty of reasons why. HSBC's Chi Tsang expects the company to get more market share in sales of items like cosmetics, baby products, and food and beverages. If it gets more scale in selling these goods, JD.com will start to enjoy more rebates from suppliers as its orders get bigger. That should help margins down the line. His target price for the stock is $45, or more than 10% higher.
Alibaba will report fourth-quarter earnings in mid-May. Its stock has surged almost 40% in 2017 on the back of a resurgence in online retail purchases by Chinese. A red-hot property market has fueled demand for household goods and appliances. (For more on Alibaba's upcoming earnings, see my colleague Isabella Zhong's story on page 32.)
Although they have similarities, Alibaba is very different from JD.com. While JD.com, like Amazon.com (AMZN), sells from its own inventory, Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall platforms connect buyers and sellers. The company takes a cut from each transaction. It also gets cash from advertisers.
The tug of war between Alibaba and JD.com is no longer just in China. Both are investing heavily outside of the Middle Kingdom as they seek to reach new audiences and augment their technological prowess. Both are investing in Indonesia. The contest is by no means over.

HSBC,The U.K. Can Still Exit Brexit," May 15, 2017",1,"
Views from beyond the Barron's staff
DESPITE THE RELATIVELY NARROW victory of Brexit last year and the official beginning of the separation process, there is still a real possibility the United Kingdom will remain in the European Union. The populist-nationalist rebellion-as exemplified by Brexit and the election of Donald Trump-could be short-lived. Pro-EU centrist Emmanuel Macron of France defeated anti-EU Marine Le Pen by a nearly 2-to-1 majority, and the Netherlands also recently rejected a Trumpian populist.
Americans and Brits, nonetheless, have short memories. Twelve years ago, the French people were given a chance to ratify the EU constitution or to vote against it in a referendum. By 55% to 45%, the Gallic electorate voted resoundingly non. Two years later, nonetheless, the French elected a new leader, Nicolas Sarkozy, who proceeded to simplify the treaty and shiftFrance's position 180 degrees to oui, without a new vote of the French people.
The same executive adjustment could occur in the U.K. In fact, under the EU treaty that Britain signed, the Brexit referendum was merely advisory-not legally binding on the government. Prime Minister Theresa May invoked Article 50 of the treaty, the exit mechanism, in March, allowing for an unprecedented withdrawal. But before the article was summoned, the British High Court and anti-Brexit leaders insisted on a parliamentary vote on the referendum.
At May's behest, the House of Commons approved the invocation of Article 50 earlier this year. The House of Lords, however, voted decidedly against Brexit. To further complicate matters, members of Parliament from Scotland, Northern Ireland, Gibraltar, and greater London could follow their constituents' wishes and encourage a vote of no confidence against Brexit.
May was, after all, opposed to Brexit from the start, and she could change sides again, or lose a leadership vote. Failing any other tactic, all May or her successor needs to do is wait a year or so, after all the costs are added up and the zealous Brexit camp has died down, and follow Sarkozy's example by switching to ""Bremain"" without another referendum.
Despite Britain's invocation of Article 50, member states of the EU would probably welcome such an about-face as the return of a wayward relative to the family fold.
There are many practical reasons for the U.K. to remain in the EU. Since Britain was allowed to join the European
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 547 of 1177
Economic Community in 1973, London has emerged as the undisputed capital of finance in Europe. If Brexit is allowed to unfold, many European and American banks could be compelled to move from the City of London to banking centers on the Continent, such as Frankfurt, Paris, or Amsterdam.
The job losses in the City-Britain's Wall Street-could be massive. Estimates range from 75,000 to 150,000. Big banks including HSBC, UBS, and Goldman Sachs have already announced they will be moving a significant number of positions from London to a major city on the Continent.
Additional jobs inevitably would be lost in other sectors and regions of the British economy. After evidence mounts that such a transformation would result in fewer positions, lower real estate values, reduced tax revenue, devalued currency, and a drop in gross domestic product-and considering that finance is one of the biggest and most profitable businesses in the U.K.-will the British still want to leave the union?
As an article in the Economist pointed out, Britain is one of the world's biggest recipients of foreign direct investment, at roughly $1.5 trillion. About half of that comes from the EU. Does Britain really want to reject $750 billion of capital investment? The U.K. also receives many EU subsidies and tax incentives worth billions of pounds sterling annually. Do they actually want to look such a generous gifthorse in the mouth?
The divorce bill for the U.K.'s withdrawal has recently been increased from $65 billion to $110 billion, as dictated by the EU. By Bremaining rather than Brexiting, Britain could also avoid paying such a steep withdrawal penalty. Post-Brexit, London would need to renegotiate all of its trade treaties with the remaining 27 member states of the EU. But that would be just the beginning of all the legal and consulting fees and headaches involved. Many World Trade Organization treaties are based on the U.K.'s inclusion in the EU. Without that affiliation, all of Britain's WTO agreements would also have to be r e n e g o t i - ated. Those treaty drafts would then need to be ratified by Parliament, as well as by the legislative bodies of all other sovereign and supranational entities involved. According to some knowledgeable international trade lawyers at Hogan Lovells, it could take up to a full decade for the U.K. to renegotiate all of its international trade and tarifftreaties and agreements. Legal, accounting, and consulting fees would add up to a considerable amount.
Besides all the economic and legal reasons, a major argument to Bremain lies in British national pride and regional economic interests. If, as a result of Brexit, the U.K. loses Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Gibraltar, how Great will the remaining bits of Britain actually be?
Since the Brexit vote, the rapid devaluation of the British pound has thrust France, at about $2.7 trillion GDP, ahead of the U.K., at $2.6 trillion. If, furthermore, the post- Brexit U.K. dissolves into its constituent parts, it would lose its inclusion in the top tier of economic world powers. Such a public disgrace should prove unacceptable to the average Brit. Over the next year or so, the prime minister might find herself changing her mind yet again.

HSBC,"Bryant Park's Developer Takes on a Public Space in Newark, N.J. Military Park, with free ping pong, Wi-Fi and other amenities, is already revitalizing downtown Newark, boosters say"," May 16, 2017",1,"
What has thousands of purple pansies, free ping pong and board games, free yoga, free movies, free Wi-Fi, a reading room, a carousel, clean restrooms and excellent coffee?
That answer, of course, is Bryant Park, Midtown Manhattan's celebrated gathering spot.
But you could also answer Military Park--a historic triangle of green 13 miles west, in downtown Newark.
The same man who helped transform Bryant Park from a crime-ridden drug zone in the 1980s is making a similar effort to revitalize one of the most high-profile parks in Newark.
Dan Biederman, president of the nonprofit Bryant Park Corporation, is trying to replicate the Bryant Park model in Newark, creating a great public space without government funding.
""I believe I could run any public space without public money,"" he says.
There's a formula, he says, and it starts with free programming--from movie nights and classes to open air libraries. That's to ensure the park feels busy and safe enough to attract women. Clean bathrooms and general beautification also help with that effort.
Then there's trick of turning a public park into a giant money machine.
Nearly three decades into its revival, Bryant Park has a $19.4 million budget. It spends $271,000 a year on its restrooms alone, $69,000 just on employee uniforms. And it has no trouble paying the bills.
Sponsors including Bank of America, Southwest Airlines, Zara and HSBC pay a collective $6 million a year to plaster their names on the skate pavilion, food kiosks, Wi-Fi and reading room. Skate rentals generate another $5 million. The park's two restaurants and five kiosk operators pay about $3 million in rent.
Military Park's numbers aren't quite so impressive. Its budget is just $745,000, a third of which goes to Biederman's private consulting firm, Biederman Redevelopment Ventures, to manage its operations.
While it has one restaurant, a carousel selling $2 tickets and several Wi-Fi sponsors, Military Park generates little revenue: about $80,000 last year. It's funded mainly by donations from nearby businesses like Prudential Financial and PSE&G.
The reason for the disparity? Visitor numbers. While 6-acre Bryant Park attracts as many as 4,000 visitors at any given time, Military Park, also 6 acres, peaks at 400.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 551 of 1177
Attracting big crowds to Military Park won't be easy, if only because Newark's population of 280,000 isn't nearly as dense as Midtown's. And most folks working in Newark aren't in the habit of lingering downtown after hours.
On a sunny afternoon last week, the carousel attendant sat patiently waiting for customers. The ping-pong tables were silent. A few couples sunbathed on the lawns, but the park was largely empty.
Mr. Biederman and other boosters say the park does better in warmer weather. And just as Bryant Park helped lift surrounding Midtown property values--by more than 20%, according to one 2014 study--Military Park is already revitalizing downtown Newark. It is flanked by the new Prudential office tower, several luxury apartment developments and new businesses including Starbucks and Whole Foods.
Miles Berger, a developer prescient enough to start buying buildings on Military Park 30 years ago, says that since the park reopened in 2014, rents on his office spaces rose $3-to-$5 a square foot, while room rates at his Robert Treat Hotel rose more than 35%.
""It's become an attraction,"" he says of the formerly rundown park.
Park-goers, too, say they appreciate the progress. ""It's growing. You can see the improvement,"" said Tiffany Muhammad, who was pushing her two sons through the park in a double stroller. She enjoyed the recent Easter egg hunt: ""They had eggs all over the place!""
Estimates vary as to how long it will take to attract the big crowds.
Park Ambassador Hakkiem Ervin, who rides around the park on his Segway giving directions and warning children not to pick the tulips, says he sometimes hears people commenting that Military Park isn't nearly as busy as Bryant Park. But come summer, he predicts, that's going to change.
""Once the weather breaks,"" he says, ""you gonna get in line to play that ping-pong table!""

HSBC,"U.K.'s Lloyds Stake, a Remnant of the Financial Crisis, Is Finally Sold Off; Nearly a decade after bailout, British government sells its remaining shares in U.K.'s biggest retail bank"," May 17, 2017",0,"LONDON--The U.K. government has sold its last remaining stake in Lloyds Banking Group PLC, a watershed moment for the British lender almost a decade after it was bailed out for more than £20 billion at the height of the financial crisis.
The bank said that, including dividends and share sales, the government has in total received £21.2 billion ($27.4 billion), £894 million more than it put in. The U.K. Treasury has been gradually selling shares for several years.
The sale is a milestone for Anto?nio Horta-Oso?rio, the bank's chief executive since February 2011, who has presided over a transformation from a troubled bank with a sprawling international footprint to one focused almost entirely on one country: Britain.
In its home country, Lloyds has become a retail and commercial lending powerhouse. Mr. Horta-Oso?rio, in an interview last week with Dow Jones's Financial News, says he isn't changing his focus.
""I don't think that investors should expect any significant change of direction,"" he said.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 553 of 1177
This credo means that, despite its deep relationships with companies across the U.K., Lloyds won't expand its capital markets offering. For Mr. Horta-Oso?rio, that type of risky business is no longer in the bank's DNA and cost structure.
""We leave businesses like trading equities and others to experts like investment banks,"" he says, with only a hint of a smile after the word ""experts.""
In London finance circles, Lloyds went from being a source of worries--or worse, the butt of jokes--to being hailed as a comeback story. It contrasts favorably with Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, the other big British bank bailed out during the financial crisis . RBS is still majority owned by the government, which is sitting on a large loss.
His performance at Lloyds means Mr. Horta-Oso?rio is facing questions about the future. The chief executive job at HSBC PLC, a much bigger bank, will open up next year . Mr. Horta-Oso?rio, 53 years old, is a perpetual CEO, having run his first bank when he was 29. When pressed on whether he wanted to stay at Lloyds, he said simply: ""I am very happy.""
Asked to elaborate, he didn't offer much more, mentioning the obvious tasks ahead: the integration of credit-card provider MBNA, whose £1.9 billion acquisition was announced in December ; more technology investments; and the bank's next strategic plan, due out in the fall. ""I am really happy at the bank and I am very focused on these next few tasks,"" Mr. Horta-Oso?rio said.
Mr. Horta-Oso?rio said investors shouldn't expect another ""big bang"" strategic change at Lloyds. The bank has sold or closed operations in some 24 countries, shut thousands of branches, cut tens of thousands of jobs and poured money into digital infrastructure.
""When you have a company or a bank in huge difficulty...you need bold ideas, you need a huge turnaround strategy, and you need a very strong change of direction,"" he added. ""When you are pursuing a successful strategy, I think you have a different leadership style and a different type of objectives.""
To those who criticize him for putting all of Lloyds's eggs in the U.K. basket, the Portuguese executive answers that, in the current regulatory environment, spreading the bank across geographies would be much worse.
In his view, the rule changes ushered in after the 2008 financial crisis are forcing banks to keep more capital within national boundaries to reassure local authorities they wouldn't be a burden on the taxpayer in the event of failure. As a result, banks' ability to move capital cheaply across countries is a thing of the past and being in a lot of places at once has become a competitive disadvantage.
""The big strategic changes in banking are mainly related to much stronger regulation, much higher capital levels and a need from banks--fortunately, I would say--of having a much bigger focus on customers,"" he said. ""I would argue that banks have really to focus on where they have their competitive advantages. Because to go into multiple countries now is not an advantage.""
So far, this belief has paid off--Lloyds's shares have risen by more than 12% since Mr. Horta-Oso?rio took the reins, more than rivals like Barclays PLC and RBS (though all three have underperformed the FTSE 100).
But dangers lurk, led by the potential economic aftershocks of Brexit.
Mr. Horta-Oso?rio, who took British citizenship well before the fate of European Union nationals in the U.K. became an issue, argues that Lloyds's conservative business model and low cost base would enable it to weather any major downturn.

HSBC,"Arrivederci Alitalia? Italy Looks for Buyers for Airline; The Italian government put the country's struggling flag carrier up for sale, but a buyer may be hard to find"," May 18, 2017",0,"It could finally be arrivederci for Alitalia SpA, the Italian flag carrier that shuttles the pope around the world.
Italy's government put the airline up for sale this week, seeking expressions of interest from bidders before a June 5 deadline. That followed months of fruitless talks with labor unions and the carrier's shareholders, including its biggest, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways.
A one-time symbol of the country's postwar la dolce vita, Alitalia has racked up years of losses amid competition from a swarm of budget airlines in Europe. Three years ago, Etihad poured in cash to refresh the carrier , retraining cabin crew and replacing fading interiors with Italian-designed leather seats.
But that hasn't been enough . Alitalia has lost billions of dollars over decades, amassing more than $3 billion in debt. The airline, which hasn't yet published results, signaled it may have had an operational loss exceeding $600 million last year.
Italy, Alitalia's home market, demonstrates the airline's losing battle to woo customers. In 2010, the carrier commanded 29% of Italy's domestic market, according to Euromonitor. In 2015, the last year data is available, that had dropped to 25%, in a commercial-aviation market in which rivals typically fight hard for every 10th of a percentage point.
The three biggest budget carriers flying in Italy, meanwhile, boosted their share from just over 12% in 2010 to 16% five years later. Ireland's Ryanair Holdings PLC is now the biggest airline in Italy by passenger numbers.
Earlier this month, Alitalia filed for what is essentially bankruptcy-court protection from creditors, for the second time in a decade. The airline declared insolvency after employees rejected a restructuring plan put forward by its major shareholders.
Etihad owns 49% of the airline and refused to put more cash into Alitalia without significant concessions from workers. A consortium of Italian investors owns the rest.
After failing to broker a compromise, the Italian government said it would run an auction for the airline. Alitalia said it expects Rome to name bankers to advise on the sale in coming days.
Analysts and aviation executives say the government will struggle to find a buyer. Many of Europe's biggest airlines have ruled out making a bid. Non-European buyers are limited to minority stakes.
That makes liquidation, a breakup or a major restructuring real possibilities. The government has indicated it is willing to put another [euro]600 million ($668 million) into the airline to keep it flying through the busy summer travel season, as it seeks a buyer. It has ruled out nationalizing the carrier, but Alitalia's 12,500 jobs may make a full-fledged wind down too high a political price.
""I don't believe there will be a buyer for the existing company,"" said Sven Reinke, senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service Ltd. A debt-free liquidation process could draw interest from some airlines eager to take over specific rights, he said, but that may be the extent of the interest.
The company may still have one attractive asset: Its name.
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 556 of 1177
Synonymous with the glamorous jet set of the 1960s, Alitalia flew movie stars like Rock Hudson and Ingrid Bergman when they came to film in Rome. At its peak, it was Europe's No. 3 carrier by passengers flown. Its green- and-red livery has been the backdrop to papal arrivals around the world.
A smaller, less well-known airline might be interested in snapping up the brand alone, said HSBC analyst Andrew Lobbenberg. But he adds that an airline buyer swooping in for all of the company is unlikely.

HSBC,"Bond Buyers Forgive and Forget, Flock Back to Online Lenders' Debt; Online lenders have scrambled to make their credits more attractive to investors by overhauling their lending criteria and shortening loan terms"," May 21, 2017",1,"
The initial appeal of upstart, online lenders was that they would disrupt traditional loan markets. But after big setbacks last year, the firms are adjusting to be a little more Wall Street and a little less Silicon Valley. Changes include holding on to the risk of some loans they make, securitizing their loans--or selling them in packages--themselves rather than through third parties, and naming veterans of banks and investment firms to executive roles.
Investors in bonds backed by the loans these online platforms helped broker welcomed the moves. Last year, as skepticism mounted about their offerings, these investors pulled back from purchasing their loans. But since the start of April, more than $2 billion in securities backed by loans made by LendingClub Corp., Prosper Marketplace Inc. and their peers have either been sold or are being prepared for an imminent sale, according to credit-rating firms and people familiar with the matter. That is already more than was issued in the entire second quarter of 2016, according to data tracker PeerIQ.
Deals are also getting done at more favorable prices: The extra yield, or spread, investors demanded on recent deals from Social Finance Inc. and Avant Inc., above that of safe government debt, was much lower than on similar deals each lender brought last year.
The most recent activity comes on top of $3 billion in bonds backed by online loans that were issued in the first quarter of 2017, double the amount from the same period a year earlier, according to PeerIQ.
Early last year, confidence in these lenders was rocked by an upsurge in defaults, warnings from bond-rating firms and a scandal that forced out the CEO of industry leader LendingClub. Money managers responded by slowing their purchases of debt issued by these lenders and asked for higher yields.
Since then, online lenders have scrambled to make their credits more attractive to investors. They overhauled their
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 558 of 1177
lending criteria, cut off weaker consumers, shortened loan terms and started charging customers more to borrow in an attempt to boost yields.
""It was really important to see there was some kind of a consumer lending background...as opposed to just an algorithm,"" said Joe Astorina, head of asset-backed securities research at AllianceBernstein Holding LP. Investors are embracing online lenders' debt offerings for their relative value compared with other debt, the better quality of underlying loans and moves they made to more closely resemble established finance firms rather than technology-driven startups.
One factor working in lenders' favor: falling yields in other categories of debt, notably high-yield bonds. While yields on U.S. government debt rose following last November's election in anticipation of stronger economic growth, rates on high-yield debt fell due to expectations companies would fare better under the new administration. That made the lenders' loan packages more attractive on a comparative basis.
The spread demanded by money managers to hold bonds issued by risky companies above that of safe government debt was 3.84 percentage points on Wednesday, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. That is down from 6.40 on the same day in 2016 and down from a high of nearly 10 percentage points in February that year.
""We've gone through one messy incident and rebounded from that,"" said Perry Rahbar, CEO of dv01, which provides analytics on online loans to bond investors.
Information from a Kroll Bond Rating Agency report on an April securitization from Avant Inc. involving 46,896 loans shows how lending standards have changed in the past year. The average loan backing the deal had a balance of $5,359 and a term of 37 months, down from $7,572 and 47 months on an Avant deal from February 2016. Between those transactions, Avant hired Grant Miles, a former senior executive in the U.S. lending business of HSBC Holdings PLC, to be its chief risk officer.
Those changes helped drive Kroll's base case for losses down to a range of 16.3% to 18.3% of the balance of loans in the pool, from between 19% and 21% on the earlier deal. That means investors buying securities backing the loans could hope they carry less risk.
The spread on the least risky slice of Avant's most recent bond deal was 1 percentage point below what it was on a transaction the company completed in the summer of 2016, according to PeerIQ.
To be sure, bonds backed by online loans account for a fraction of the securitization market. In 2016, a total of $7.8 billion of bonds backed by online loans were issued, according to PeerIQ. That compared with $191 billion in total issuance of asset-backed securities, according to S&P Global Ratings.
And while investors have grown more enamored of offerings from online lenders, some bondholders are still smarting from past deals where loss estimates have been revised higher.
The next test of investor appetite for online offerings will be in coming weeks when LendingClub starts to market a roughly $400 million deal of bonds backed by loans it made to less creditworthy consumers, according to people familiar with the matter. Last week, a $450.5 million deal backed by 39,334 Prosper personal loans was oversubscribed, according to a person familiar with the matter. It was the first transaction under Prosper's new Chief Executive David Kimball and new Chief Financial Officer Usama Ashraf, each of whom held senior roles in the finance department of USAA.

HSBC,"Saudi Arabia Remains Tough Place to Do Business, Despite U.S. Deals; Government has been slow to change; 'treacherous for foreign investors'"," May 21, 2017",0,"
The U.S. and Saudi Arabia touted more than $400 billion in deals and potential investments during President Donald Trump's visit to Riyadh, collectively sending a message that the kingdom was open for business.
That was the easy part. Saudi Arabia remains a tough place for foreign companies, observers say.
Challenges range from the lack of bankruptcy legislation to a culture of personal connections. Government policy decisions are sometimes abruptly reversed. And there is a lack of clarity on legal matters, too, due to the coexistence of both civil law and Islamic Shariah law.
Despite some positive changes, ""the current system remains treacherous for foreign investors to navigate,"" said Riyadh-based lawyer Christopher Johnson, who is also vice chair of the American Business Group of Riyadh, a body that promotes U.S. business interests in the kingdom.
Some officials acknowledge change will require time and patience. ""The Saudi government is not very efficient,"" said an economic adviser to the royal court. ""It's an area in which we're not doing very well.""
Many blue-chip companies aren't deterred.
The U.S. and Saudi Arabia over the weekend unveiled a raft of multibillion-dollar agreements in sectors including energy, technology and health care. Among them is a partnership between General Electric Co., Saudi Arabia's ministry of oil and a government program for joint ventures. The deal, valued at $12 billion, focuses on power generation, digitization technology and oil and gas.
The scope and size of the agreements are in tune with Saudi Arabia's desire to develop new industries at home. That is a central goal of a government effort to reduce the country's dependence on oil. That change, Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih said Sunday, ""requires our industrial base to grow in the order of magnitude.""
But as oil prices have fallen, the business environment has become more challenging. The Saudi government stopped paying construction giants such as the Saudi Binladin Group, resulting in tens of thousands of layoffs of mostly Asian blue-collar workers but also Western engineers and project managers.
Many international banks are positioning themselves to reap the benefits of Saudi Arabia's economic liberalization, including the public offering of the world's largest oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., or Saudi Aramco, which could fetch the Saudi government as much as $100 billion.
But many global lenders have struggled to find their footing in the country. BNP Paribas SA and Standard Chartered PLC lent to Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi &Brothers, a troubled Saudi Arabian conglomerate that defaulted on its debts almost eight years ago, forcing its creditors into a $6 billion restructuring that still hasn't been fully resolved .
Two years ago, HSBC Holdings PLC's Saudi Arabia unit came under investigation by regulators in the kingdom for its role in a stock listing that has left investors nursing heavy losses. HSBC's Saudi unit last year said it has taken provisions to settle issues related to the regulator's investigation, without elaborating.
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 561 of 1177
Last year, the Saudi stock-market regulator banned the local unit of Deloitte &Touche LLP from providing accounting services in the kingdom for two years because of its work with a local contracting company that allegedly had breached market regulations. Deloitte said it was disappointed but respected the regulator's decision.
In the World Bank's Doing Business Index, Saudi Arabia ranks 94 out of 190 economies. In terms of starting a business, Saudi Arabia ranks 147, trailing its Gulf neighbors in the United Arab Emirates and even Iran.
The kingdom has said it is determined to quickly improve the business environment. The government recently established new arbitration centers to handle commercial disputes and is working on a new procurement law for government agencies and on an insolvency law, according to the kingdom's investment agency.
It also introduced a business law last year that includes measures to better protect minority shareholders, and officials have pledged to bring government bodies into the digital age by allowing more business transactions to be handled online.
""The authorities are beginning to make good progress in identifying and reducing obstacles to private-sector growth,"" said Tim Callen, the International Monetary Fund's mission chief for Saudi Arabia. ""These efforts should continue.""

HSBC,Citigroup Settles With Justice Department Over Money Laundering; $97.44 million agreement includes a so-called nonprosecution agreement," May 22, 2017",1,"Citigroup Inc. has agreed to pay less than $100 million to settle a yearslong money laundering investigation, the bank and government agencies announced Monday.
The bank reached a settlement with the Justice Department and U.S. attorney's office in Boston for $97.44 million, with no sanctions against Citigroup and a so-called nonprosecution agreement, according to the bank and Justice Department. The investigation centered on activity in the bank's Banamex USA unit.
As part of the agreement, Citigroup admitted that Banamex USA violated the Bank Secrecy Act from at least 2007 until at least 2012.
The agreement is far less than previous money laundering settlements with large banks and is one of the first to emerge since the change in presidential administrations. Other deals with big banks have often topped $1 billion and involved so-called deferred prosecution agreements or criminal guilty pleas.
In 2012, HSBC settled for about $1.9 billion; in 2014 J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. settled for about $2 billion and BNP Paribas settled for nearly $9 billion; and in 2015 Commerzbank settled for about $1.5 billion.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 563 of 1177
Citigroup's settlement is just the second nonprosecution agreement, known as an NPA, for a big bank in the last eight years. The other arose from J.P. Morgan's settlement last year over hiring sons and daughters of Asian government officials, known as princelings.
Citigroup said in a statement that it was ""pleased to resolve these matters."" The bank said it would be finished with winding down Banamex USA by June 30. ""Among our most serious obligations as a bank is to achieve the strongest possible system for anti-money-laundering and sanctions compliance to protect the integrity of the financial system,"" the bank added.
While Citigroup's settlement was far smaller than those of its peers, it isn't clear to investors if this will result in a gain that could be reflected in upcoming earnings. While banks often say in quarterly releases if they increased or decreased their litigations reserves, the absolute level of those reserves isn't disclosed.
Citigroup had litigation expenses of $1.1 billion in 2016, according to bank regulatory filings.
Banamex USA was a California-based bank owned by Citigroup that operated a handful of branches along the U.S.- Mexican border. Citigroup announced in 2015 that it would shut down Banamex USA and began closing branches. That same year the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and California Department of Business Oversight fined Banamex USA $140 million for lax monitoring of potentially illicit transactions being conducted through cross- border remittances.
The unit was previously part of the much larger Mexico-based Banamex group that Citigroup acquired in 2001. This is now known as Citibanamex .
From 2007 to 2012, Banamex USA processed over 30 million remittance transactions to Mexico with a total value of more than $8.8 billion, but there was virtually no investigation for suspicious activity, according to a statement of facts related to the settlement. Over that time period, the banking unit filed just nine suspicious activity reports, even though its own monitoring reports identified over 18,000 alerts on more than $142 million in potentially suspicious transactions, the statement said.
In March 2017, the FDIC announced regulatory resolutions with four former Banamex USA executives related to Bank Secrecy Act violations. Those prohibited some individuals from participation in the conduct of a financial institution and included monetary penalties ranging from $30,000 to $90,000.
Citigroup's last major settlement with the Justice Department was for $925 million in 2015, alongside several other banks , related to alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market. In 2014 Citigroup paid $7 billion to the Justice Department and other agencies to settle allegations that it knowingly sold shoddy mortgages to investors.

HSBC,Tencent Is Worth Its Rich Valuation," May 22, 2017",0,"BARRON'S ASIA
A version of this article appeared on March 18 at Barrons.com.
TENCENT HOLDINGS' IMPRESSIVE FIRST-quarter earnings, reported on Wednesday, demonstrate why the Chinese internet giant deserves a ritzy valuation: It's growing strongly, and there's more good news to come.
Tencent's (ticker: 0700.Hong Kong) most valuable assets are the 938 million users of its messaging app WeChat. It's now ramping up the conversion of those eyeballs into revenue through mobile gaming, digital content subscriptions, and advertising. There's also ample room to grow, as newer businesses such as online payments and cloud computing ramp up, and as the company transforms from being a games publisher to an online entertainment and content powerhouse.
At 264 Hong Kong dollars per share ($34), Tencent stock isn't cheap, but it is worth the hefty price tag. The stock is up 64% over the past year and trades at 37 times forward earnings. (The Standard &Poor's 500 index has a forward price/earnings ratio of 18.) But Tencent has many levers to pull and is led by an impressive management team that has laid out solid plans for future growth. We have been longtime fans of the stock, and CEO Huateng ""Pony"" Ma is a regular on Barron's list of the world's best CEOs.
The highlight of Tencent's first-quarter results was the strength of its mobilegaming business. Revenue for the unit surged 57% year over year, underpinning the company's 55% top-line growth. Mobile gaming's strong revenue growth pushed Tencent's net profit roughly 42% higher year over year despite its operating margins getting squeezed by investments in video content and cloud computing.
Tencent trumped analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings. The key driver of the surge in mobile-gaming revenue was Honor of Kings, Tencent's first self-developed blockbuster mobile title. The game showcases the company's growing strength as a content developer. Another title, TLBB, soared to the No. 5 spot on its second day
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 569 of 1177
of release. A strong pipeline this year should help to buoy Tencent's mobile-gaming revenue, which Nomura analyst Jialong Shi expects to grow at a 51% pace.
Another bright spot: Tencent's online video business. Video subscription revenue tripled from the same time last year, while video advertising revenue continued to grow strongly. While the unit is still loss-making, JPMorgan analyst Alex Yao expects it to break even by 2019, as revenue grows at an average 52% annual pace and content costs decline. Yao expects Tencent Video to gain ground on Baidu's (BIDU) iQiyi in the next few years, given that Tencent has great content across all major entertainment categories. Tencent's self-produced TV drama Candle in the Tomb has attracted almost 2.5 billion views.
Yao has an overweight rating on Tencent with a target price of HK$290, which implies 7% upside. Adding additional fuel to Tencent's strength in entertainment and content is the company's recent licensing deal with Universal Music.
Cloud computing, online payments, and a growing international footprint could also lift earnings. Online payments and cloudcomputing revenue spiked 224% year over year in the first quarter. HSBC analyst Chi Tsang says Tencent is stepping up its efforts in the cloud and expects to commercialize the existing cloud products that it uses in house. The company is also making progress in consumer lending and asset management to complement its onlinepayments business. Tsang has a buy rating on the stock, with an HK$290 target price.
Tencent also has exposure to Southeast Asia's sprawling and rapidly growing internet market, with stakes in gaming and ecommerce platform Sea Ltd. (formerly Garena) and motorbike ride-sharing platform Go-Jek. U.S. investors can buy Tencent's American depositary receipts (TCEHY), more than one million of which trade daily. They closed on Thursday at $34.06. *"

HSBC,"Globalization, Gold and the Return of History; A retreat from free trade and free capital flows isn't inevitable"," May 25, 2017",1,"
Donald Trump's first venture abroad has been notable for its calm, after the tumult he left behind in Washington. For investors worried that the U.S. president could destabilize the global trade and security regime, his willingness so far to stick to the script might have come as a relief.
The long-term picture isn't so benign for those who've profited from globalization, as former HSBC chief economist Stephen King sets out in a new book, ""Grave New World."" Mr. King's thesis is that the increased globalization of the past four decades is an anomaly in historical terms, and--in a nod to Francis Fukuyama--we're seeing ""the return of history.""
Unfortunately for investors it is tricky to play the Great Game of geopolitics. The return to harder national borders for both money and people that the Brexit vote and Mr. Trump's election seemed to presage has so far led to nothing but pain for those who bet on a breakdown of trade. Elections in France, Austria and the Netherlands all rejected similar moves, and Germany's populist party has imploded.
Longer-term worries about the future shouldn't be tied to any particular election. After all, if the U.S. had the French electoral system, Hillary Clinton would be in Air Force One today. The concern is about whether developed-world voters are rejecting the sales pitch for globalization.
Mr. King worries that they are turning instead to inward-looking policies and populist leaders, just as happened after many past financial crises. The basic justification for more free trade, and for the free flows of capital that now go with it, is that it makes everyone richer. Sadly, it just isn't true. What trade should do is expand the world economy faster, because investments can be made more efficiently--something well worth doing. But how the gains are shared out is critical, and the losers watched in envy as the global elite gathered ever more of the spoils. Until the financial crisis none of this mattered, because growth was fast enough virtually everywhere to keep the complaints under control. Since Lehman failed, years of slow growth meant fewer winners and more losers, and further undermined the argument that free trade helped growth (though it would surely have been even slower still if trade had been restricted). Where populists have succeeded, they have been able to play on fears of trade and of immigration , the most visible part of globalization.
A retreat from free trade and free capital flows isn't inevitable. Mr. Trump hasn't followed through on election pledges to label China a currency manipulator , and dropped his plan to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Yet, there are plenty of signs that voters are cleaving to national banners to rally against the international order. Even the new, pro-trade French president, Emmanuel Macron, wants to raise restrictions on takeovers of European companies, and one of the first moves by the European Union in the Brexit talks was to threaten to force the operators of basic parts of the financial system to move out of London. European banks have in large part retreated back to their home countries, reimposing national constraints on eurozone finance. In the U.S. Mr. Trump has imposed tariffs on Canadian timber and attacked Canada's dairy industry . He plans to force more use of U.S. steel and, while he kept the U.S. in Nafta, the deal will now be renegotiated.
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 574 of 1177
The problem for investors is threefold. Even pessimists such as Mr. King accept that a full retreat from globalization is far from certain. If it happens, it could play out quickly, as it did with the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930, or take a long time. And whenever it happens, no one is sure whether a reversal of globalization would lead to inflation, as tariffs push up prices and expensive workers replace cheap foreign labor, or to deflation, as the economy shrinks. Inflation and deflation require radically different responses from investors.
The natural reaction from investors is the same as it's been to political dangers over the past five years: take no notice of the threat until it is impossible to ignore, typically when it is just months away, then panic.
Investors don't have to put their heads in the sand. One option is to avoid the countries that were the biggest winners from globalization, which include Singapore, South Korea and the U.K. Another is to buy into economies best able to stand alone, so long as they have robust property-rights protections; Switzerland and the U.S. are obvious examples, although both are already pricey.
Perhaps the best alternative is to use part of a portfolio to hold insurance, in the form of what Mr. King calls a ""universally acceptable store of value,"" physical gold. If the global trade and financial system retreats to national borders, gold becomes one of the few international assets. If everything turns out fine for free traders, the cost of the gold has to be thought of as an (expensive) insurance premium.
""We're dealing with inherent deep uncertainty,"" Mr. King says. ""It's all very well assuming that globalization is the natural order of things, but it's not. You should at least have a hedge.""

HSBC,"Chairman of Brazilian Meatpacker JBS, Joesley Batista, Resigns After Revelations of Bribes; Mr. Batista and his brother admitted to paying about $150 million--mostly in bribes--to nearly 2,000 politicians"," May 27, 2017",0,"
SA?O PAULO--The chairman of the world's largest meat producer, JBS SA, stepped down Friday, weeks after telling prosecutors his company bribed Brazilian politicians , including President Michel Temer, in exchange for taxpayer- subsidized loans and other favors.
Joesley Batista, the youngest son of JBS's founder and the architect of its blistering expansion into the U.S. and other international markets, will be replaced immediately by board member Tarek Farahat, the company said in a statement late Friday.
The resignation deepens the uncertainty around JBS, Brazil's second-largest nonfinancial firm by revenue. Over the past 15 years, the company has transformed itself from a relatively unknown firm outside Brazil
into the owner of popular U.S. brands such as Pilgrim's Pride.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 576 of 1177
The company also supplies meat globally to restaurant chains, including McDonald's, Burger King, Subway, Outback Steakhouse, KFC and Wendy's.
""We will work hard to restore trust with the market and protect the more than 235,000 families that are part of JBS,"" Mr. Farahat said in a statement. ""There is a significant amount of work to be done in order to regain the trust of our stakeholders.""
Mr. Batista stepped down a week after prosecutors disclosed the contents of a plea deal he and his older brother, JBS CEO Wesley Batista, struck with authorities in April as part of the country's sprawling anticorruption investigation.
The company declined to say why Wesley Batista remained CEO. A person familiar with the matter said that of the two brothers, Joesley Batista dealt more regularly with Brazilian politicians.
In exchange for being spared jail time, the brothers and other high-level company officials admitted to paying about $150 million--mostly in bribes--to nearly 2,000 Brazilian politicians, including Brazil's past three presidents, according to the plea deal. The allegations were a bombshell in Brazil and prompted calls for the ouster of Mr. Temer. The Brazilian president has denied the allegations.
""Companies like JBS...were essentially criminal organizations with a corporate facade,"" said Paulo Sotero, director of the Brazil Institute at the Wilson Center.
A fine of 11.2 billion reais ($3.4 billion) demanded of JBS's holding company by Brazilian prosecutors threatens to drive up the firm's already-high debt levels, prompting ratings firms Fitch Ratings and Moody's Investors Service to downgrade its credit rating on May 22 . JBS has also hired two law firms to negotiate with authorities in the U.S., where it earns two-thirds of its revenue.
Brazilian bankers said they are already getting calls from international investors eyeing the assets of JBS and its parent company.
For a company once hailed as a Brazilian national champion and the face of the country's bright future, the Batista brothers' testimony laid bare the dark side of JBS's rise, where cozy ties to politicians gave the company cheap credit and friendly regulation.
Billions of dollars in subsidized loans and investments from BNDES , Brazil's giant development bank, left JBS with a sprawling business empire. The meatpacker's revenues exploded from $1.8 billion in 2006 to $49 billion last year. The Batista family's holding company, J&F Investimentos--named for Joesley and Wesley's parents, Jose? and Flora--also owns a bank, one of Brazil's largest dairy brands, a cleaning-products company, a paper and pulp company, a power plant, and Havaianas, the brand of rubber flip-flops imprinted with the Brazilian flag that are sold around the world.
As it swallowed up competitors, JBS became a virtual monopoly in parts of Brazil's interior, able to squeeze ranchers for lower prices on their cattle. But unlike U.S. authorities, who blocked JBS's attempted acquisition of National Beef Packing Co. in 2008 on antitrust grounds , Brazil's government actively facilitated the company's consolidation at home and abroad.
BNDES loans facilitated the acquisition of Colorado-based Swift Foods Co. in 2007, then the third-largest beef packer in the U.S. The following year JBS bought Smithfield Beef Group, the nation's fifth-largest beef packer. And in 2009 it acquired Texas-based Pilgrim's Pride Corp., the second-largest chicken processor in the U.S., as well as one of Brazil's largest beef firms.
The BNDES financing of JBS occurred as the statist Workers' Party government that ruled Brazil from 2003 to 2016 sought to create corporate ""national champions"" in sectors where it believed the country had competitive advantages. As JBS grew--and struggled to pay back its loans--so did the BNDES equity stake in the company, which once exceeded 30%, according to the company's securities filings.
As JBS received loans from the BNDES, Mr. Batista told prosecutors as part of his plea deal, it kicked back part of the cash into offshore accounts belonging to former Finance Minister Guido Mantega, Brazilian President Luiz Ina?cio Lula da Silva, and his successor, Dilma Rousseff. By 2014, the two presidents' accounts held a total of $150 million, Mr. Batista alleged. Each has denied wrongdoing in the past.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 577 of 1177

To help JBS complete its acquisition of Swift in 2007, the bank paid 1.14 billion reais for a 13% equity stake in JBS, according to company filings. The next year it injected 1 billion reais more for JBS's purchase of Smithfield Beef and Five Rivers, also in the U.S. In 2009, BNDES swapped $2 billion in convertible debentures for shares, upping its stake to 18.5%, to allow JBS to finish the Pilgrim's Pride deal. And in 2011, the bank converted 3.48 billion reais of debentures into equity, giving it a 30.4% stake.
Founded in 1953 by Jose? Batista Sobrinho, the company got its start in a whitewashed building in Ana?polis, Goia?s, with capacity to slaughter just five heads of cattle a day. Its initial growth spurt came a few years later, when Brazil's government decided to move the capital from Rio de Janeiro to Brasi?lia, a short distance away.
Sensing opportunity, Mr. Batista Sobrinho followed, supplying meat to workers during the construction boom. Piggybacking on the capital's rapid growth over the ensuing decades, he expanded the company, then known as Friboi, by acquiring other meatpacking plants across Brazil. By the early 2000s, it was among the country's largest beef producers.
From there a flurry of other major buy-ups followed, encouraged by a strengthening Brazilian currency and high grains prices that were squeezing profits in the meat business around the world.
As JBS stormed the international stage, its investors were often bemused by the Batista family's folksiness. None of them finished college. The second generation had worked for their father all their lives, initially supervising workers who skinned and deboned cattle. Both Wesley and Joesley speak Portuguese with a country drawl and wear jeans around JBS's executive suite.
The company's rapid growth in recent years alarmed the brothers' mother, Flora, who often told the men that J&F had gotten ""big enough,"" according to a person familiar with the matter.
Pedro Herrera, who covered JBS for years as an analyst for HSBC, recalled a big cocktail party the company held at the Time Warner Center in New York City, many years ago. The analysts and investors all wore nice suits. Joesley showed up in jeans and a shirt and looked like he hadn't shaved in a couple of days.
""They were kind of unsophisticated people, just very smart, very savvy,"" said Mr. Herrera, adding that he was a fan of the family's laid-back style. ""In a way I am surprised by this. As an observer, I wonder, is this the price of doing business in Brazil for everybody?""

HSBC,Goldman Sachs Under Fire for Venezuela Bond Deal; President Nicolás Maduro's detractors accuse Goldman of trying to 'make a quick buck off the suffering of the Venezuelan people'," May 30, 2017",1,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is on the defensive in Venezuela after it bought bonds that had been held by the struggling country's central bank in a transaction the government's opposition decried as a lifeline to President Nicola?s Maduro's embattled administration.
Goldman's purchase of $2.8 billion in bonds, first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Sunday , comes as Mr. Maduro's detractors have recently pleaded with international financial institutions to avoid any transactions that might help a government accused of human-rights abuses.
On Monday, they upped the ante, threatening that a successor government could forgo paying the debt.
""It is apparent Goldman Sachs decided to make a quick buck off the suffering of the Venezuelan people,"" Julio

Borges, head of Venezuela's opposition-controlled congress, said in a public letter to the New York bank's chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein. ""I also intend to recommend to any future democratic government of Venezuela not to recognize or pay on these bonds.""
Goldman Sachs's asset-management division last week paid about $865 million for $2.8 billion worth of bonds--or 31 cents on the dollar--that were issued by state oil company Petro?leos de Venezuela SA in 2014 and mature in 2022, according to people familiar with the transaction.
The price represents a 31% discount to trading Venezuelan securities that mature the same year--and would imply an annual yield of more than 40%.
In a statement, Goldman said it bought the securities, which are held in funds and accounts it manages on behalf of clients, from a broker and did not interact with the Venezuelan government. ""We recognize that the situation is complex and evolving and that Venezuela is in crisis,"" the bank said. ""We agree that life there has to get better, and we made the investment in part because we believe it will.""
Goldman Sachs Asset Management manages $750 billion of fixed-income investments for mutual funds, pension funds and other investors, about $40 billion of which is dedicated to emerging markets. It bought the bonds from London-based brokerage Dinosaur Group, people familiar with the sale said. Dinosaur Chief Executive Glenn Grossman declined to comment.
Goldman has been steadily increasing its Venezuelan holdings in recent months, betting that a change in government could more than double the value of the debt if the country, which sits atop the world's largest oil reserves, reforms its economy, two of those familiar with the transaction said.
The so-called PdVSA bonds that Goldman picked up last week had until recently been in the possession of Venezuela's central bank since they were issued in a private placement in late 2014. It is unclear whom Venezuela sold the bonds to or how many investors held them before reaching Goldman.
The Central Bank of Venezuela's international reserves jumped $442 million to $10.8 billion on Thursday, the day the bond deal was completed, according to official figures.
Two senior Venezuelan government officials confirmed the deal but declined to give more details. ""There was a need for hard currency,"" one of them said.
Last week, Oil Minister Nelson Martinez said his government was looking at ""all options"" to raise money it owes to key allies like Russia and China.
Venezuela's government, faced with low oil prices and the effects of years of economic mismanagement, is so short of cash that it has reduced imports by about 70% in the past three years, leading to a growing humanitarian crisis and spawning two months of almost-daily street demonstrations that have cost at least 60 lives.
""This government is killing us,"" said Santa Ojeda, a 50-year-old homemaker who said she can't find drugs for her diabetic teenage son. At a recent rally here, she held up a sign that read ""Venezuela Without Insulin S.O.S.""
Amid the malaise, which has made hunger a palpable concern for millions in the oil-rich nation , Mr. Maduro has committed to paying its financial debts, partly because Venezuela wants to avoid the risk of angry creditors trying to seize its international oil shipments in the case of default. That has led some economists to dub the country's securities ""hunger bonds.""
The situation also is reminiscent of Romania under dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who forced strict food rationing in order to pay off loans. Generating widespread resentment at a time when Communist regimes were falling across Eastern Europe, Mr. Ceausescu eventually was overthrown and executed by firing squad in 1989.
Venezuela will spend nearly as much money this year servicing its foreign debt--about $10 billion--as it will spend on all non-oil imports, including food and medicine, according to estimates by Nomura Securities.
Mr. Borges said the country's opposition-controlled National Assembly--which he heads--would launch an investigation into the Goldman transaction. He also warned that any future opposition government ""would not forget where Goldman Sachs stood when it had to choose between supporting the Maduro dictatorship and democracy for our country.""
Large institutional debt investors have been reluctant to pass on the hefty returns because Venezuelan debt forms

a significant part of the major bond indexes against which money managers are compared.
As a result, the securities are everywhere, including emerging-market debt funds run by Fidelity Investments, BlackRock Inc. T. Rowe Price Group Inc., HSBC Holdings PLC and Pacific Investment Management Co. Representatives for BlackRock, Fidelity, HSBC and Pimco declined to comment.
Mike Conelius, portfolio manager for the T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Bond Fund, which has about 6% of its portfolio in Venezuela, said he believes the country will have a regime change that will bring about an economic recovery--a change he would welcome.
""As unpalatable as holding Venezuela risk may seem, this is precisely the type of time that long-term investors typically want to accumulate exposure,"" he said.
Ceasing bond payments would be detrimental to a country that runs almost completely on oil exports, opening crude tankers and foreign assets to seizure by investors looking to recoup their losses. But many fear Mr. Maduro's populist policies could also lead the country down the path of default.
""Given Venezuela's intense reliance on imports, disrupting the credit markets with a default is likely to cost the country far more than it saves,"" Bulltick Research said in a recent note.
Ricardo Hausmann, who is a former Venezuelan planning minister and a critic of the Maduro government, last week urged J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. to remove Venezuelan bonds from its benchmark emerging-market debt index. That would permit investors who trade entire asset classes to avoid holding debt issued by a government accused of rights abuses, the Harvard University economist said in an essay published on the website Project Syndicate.
J.P. Morgan declined to comment.

Goldman Drops, Venezuelan Bonds Rally on Bond Deal News. Goldman Sachs opens lower Tuesday following news that the firm bought Venezuelan bonds at a discount, a lifeline to the government's struggling socialist government. Protests are planned outside the firm's Manhattan headquarters today. Venezuelan and PdVSA bonds are higher. Nomura's Siobhan Morden says the Goldman deal likely won't make or break the financing program for this year and that the main focus remains on near term regime change and recovery value which continues to support longer tenor over shorter tenors.

HSBC,"Eurozone Business Optimism Wanes Despite French Rally; Confidence weakens in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands"," May 30, 2017",0,"Eurozone businesses were less upbeat about their prospects in May, despite a boost to optimism in France after centrist Emmanuel Macron defeated anti-euro candidate Marine Le Pen in presidential elections.
The European Commission said Tuesday its Economic Sentiment Indicator, which aggregates business and consumer confidence, fell to 109.2 in May from 109.7 in April. That was a surprise, since economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal last week had expected a rise to a postcrisis high of 110.0.
The softening of sentiment serves as a reminder that while some indicators of economic activity have picked up in 2017, there are no conclusive signs of a significant acceleration of growth.
Confidence weakened in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands which could reinforce the
caution expressed by most European Central Bank policy makers , who have signaled a reluctance to wind down the bank's massive stimulus programs.
""Of course, one has to make sure that this [the currency bloc's brighter economic outlook] is something that is going to last,"" Ewald Nowotny, who sits on the ECB's governing council, said in a speech Monday .
There were signs of optimism in other parts of the eurozone economy. Manufacturers were more upbeat than at any time since June 2011 and French consumer confidence reached the highest level in almost a decade, as households became more confident about their future financial situation. On May 7, Mr. Macron won the French presidential election, defeating National Front candidate Ms. Le Pen, whose pledge to pull France from the eurozone had worried many voters and businesses.
French businesses were also encouraged by the outcome of the country's presidential election earlier this month, and France's ESI hit its highest level since mid-2011.
Also Tuesday, the French statistical agency raised its estimate for quarter-to-quarter economic growth in the first three months of the year to 0.4% from 0.3%.
""The French economy is set to see an acceleration in growth this year, and probably even more so next year, compared to the modest GDP growth rate reached in 2016,"" said Olivier Vigna, an economist at HSBC in Paris.
At the ECB, caution is founded on a worry that the eurozone's recovery hasn't yet been strong enough to deliver a sustained boost to inflation. The annual rate of inflation hit the central bank's target of just below 2% in April, but that was largely due to rises in prices of vacation services around Easter. Figures released Tuesday by Germany, Spain and Belgium suggest the eurozone's inflation rate fell back again in May.
Germany's statistics agency said consumer prices were up 1.4% on the year in May when calculated using the eurozone's common measure. That marked a sharper-than-expected fall from the 2% rate of inflation recorded by the eurozone's largest member in April. Figures for the eurozone as a whole will be released Wednesday.

HSBC,"Families in Pain as They Await Confirmation of the Worst; 'We are suffering,' say Spanish relatives of missing man"," Jun 6, 2017",1,"LONDON--Ignacio Echeverri?a's family thought their worst fear had come true when British authorities asked them to provide his fingerprints--that he was among the eight dead in the London Bridge attack.
But two days later, Mr. Echeverri?a's sister, Isabel, said she and her family in Spain were still awaiting confirmation about the fate of Ignacio, a 39-year-old HSBC employee hailed as a hero in the media amid accounts he used his skateboard to defend a woman being stabbed.
Ms. Echeverri?a said she had gone from one London hospital to another, asking for information but not getting answers. She said she had told British police she wanted to identify her brother's body--but that they had asked her to wait.
Her other brother, Joaquin Echeverri?a, has started a social media effort to try to discern what happened to Ignacio. ""We just need to know,"" Ms. Echeverri?a said. ""My mother is suffering.""
It has been a tortuous three days for families waiting to learn the fate of loved ones who were near London Bridge
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 593 of 1177
on Saturday night when three attackers plowed into pedestrians in a white van and then stabbed dozens of people. The London Metropolitan Police have identified one victim, a 30-year-old Canadian named Christine Archibald . Other names have come from family members, including the confirmation of the death of nurse Kirsty Boden, 28, and 32-year-old James McMullan of the U.K. A 27-year-old Frenchman identified only as Alexandre was confirmed dead by a French police official.
Three victims remain publicly unnamed and the lengthy identification process has caused some international friction, because the casualties hail from several countries.
On Monday, Spanish foreign minister Alfonso Dastis called his U.K. counterpart Boris Johnson to urge Britain to provide details on Mr. Echeverri?a as soon as possible, the Spanish ministry said.
""We are pressing the British authorities because, frankly, this is a situation that can't be extended for much longer,"" Mr. Dastis told reporters in Madrid.
In the U.K, the police are constrained by a formal process for identifying fatal victims of crimes that is meant to prevent errors.
""Accurately identifying victims is crucial and every care is taken to ensure this is done as quickly as possible, with due consideration to the families,"" the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.
On Tuesday, a police spokesman declined to comment specifically on Mr. Echeverri?a or the other victims from the Saturday attack.
Melissa McMullan, the sister of James McMullan who confirmed his death, mounted a desperate campaign across social media to try to find him in the aftermath of the attacks, repeatedly posting on Facebook to ask for help.
""We are praying they have something for us in the morning to end this nightmare,"" she wrote in a post early Monday morning. That day, she said she received news of her brother's likely death: that a bank card with his name on it was found on a body at the scene.
The Metropolitan Police said Tuesday that special officers were working with all of the families of people who were believed dead, including the family of one person who remained missing.
""Identifying large numbers of casualties in a major incident is a complex and challenging process,"" the police said. That process can be more difficult and slower in cases like the London Bridge attack, where several victims are from different countries, making their relatives harder to locate and bring in to identify the bodies.
Julie Wallace, of Brisbane, Australia, said she was flying to London because her 21-year-old daughter, Sara Zelenak, has been missing since the attack. She said authorities told her to wait 24 hours, but she can't face doing so.
""I have to go over and do something, I have to go over there,"" Ms. Wallace told Australia's 97.3FM radio station on Monday.
A gofundme online campaign has raised over 15,000 Australian dollars ($11,231) for Ms. Zelenak's family to fly to London.
The waiting has weighed on Mr. Echeverri?a's family and friends.
Rafael Duarte, a former co-worker at Spain's Banco Popular Espan?ol SA, said he at first thought it was a ""macabre joke"" when he heard Mr. Echeverri?a was among the missing.
""I want to talk about him in the present tense,"" Mr. Duarte said. ""We don't know where he is.""
Ignacio Echeverri?a's family issued a new plea on Tuesday for information, saying British authorities told them they would have to wait another 48 hours. The statement asked Mr. Johnson and the Spanish government to help.
""We are suffering,"" their statement said.

HSBC,For the Pound: Three Scenarios; Investors scramble to understand the outlook for sterling amid the U.K.'s political chaos," Jun 9, 2017",1,"The U.K.'s surprise general election result left the ruling Conservative Party without a majority and many investors without a clue on how the pound will react as political events unfold.
There are many ways Britain's political situation could pan out as the Conservatives scramble to form a government following their failure to win a majority in Thursday's poll. That is important for a country about to begin it is divorce from the European Union, its biggest trading partner.
Each outcome offers a different path for sterling, which tumbled by as much as 2.4% against the dollar after the exit polls came in.
""In recent European elections it's been very clear in terms of outcomes for markets--good or bad--this time it's far more foggy,"" said Antoine Lesne, head of strategy and research in Europe for SPDR ETF.
Here are a few of the scenarios investors are currently trying to game:
A Weakened Conservative Government
A Weakened Conservative Government
Strategists are torn about what a Conservative minority government means for the pound, though this is the most likely outcome of the vote.
Sustaining that government would require full backing from the Conservatives' own lawmakers and support from the Democratic Unionist Party--a Northern Irish party with 10 members of Parliament that, like the Conservatives, wants to leave the EU.
Some investors believe that outcome would lead to a stronger pound, as the government would be forced into a more conciliatory position with the EU. Most investors believe that Brexit will be bad for the British economy, given its potential effect on trade and the country's large finance industry.
""We would caution against chasing (the pound) lower from here. Today's result will in part be seen as a vote against a definitive break from the EU,"" said John Wraith, head of U.K. rates strategy at UBS. ""A Tory minority may have to make concessions in the direction of a softer exit.""
But others believe that political uncertainty may overwhelm any optimism about the potential for a so-called soft Brexit and keep pressure on sterling.
""Regardless of a possible arrangement with DUP--the new government won't have a strong mandate from the get- go,"" said Rabobank in a research note. ""As the position of the new government emerges, the currency could be in for a rocky ride.""
Analysts at HSBC predict that sterling will hit $1.20 by the end of the year, even with a Conservative-led government.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 596 of 1177
A More Powerful Labour Party
A minority government led by the Labour Party now seems unlikely. With 261 seats, even support from other parties wouldn't bring Labour to 316 seats, the number needed to get a majority.
If Prime Minister Theresa May fails to form an administration, the Labour Party would get a crack at it.
Some analysts see a minority Labour government as the most sterling-positive outcome. While both the Conservatives and Labour say Brexit should still happen, Labour is expected to adopt a more conciliatory approach with Brussels. J.P. Morgan's foreign exchange strategists predict it would push the pound 2% to 3% higher from pre-vote levels.
""It could ultimately lead to a far less disruptive Brexit,"" the bank said.
In any case, a slim conservative majority could leave the Labour Party with more influence over the shape of Brexit. If the Conservative's more pro- or anti-EU lawmakers refuse to back Mrs. May on Brexit she may have to call on Labour, which has so far stuck to its position on the issue.
""The possibility of a soft Brexit holds the promise of a more constructive view on sterling,"" said Paul O'Connor, head of multiasset at Janus Henderson. ""But the fog of domestic political uncertainly will need to clear before much faith can be placed in that scenario.""
No Functioning Government
The most negative outcome for sterling may be if it takes a long time for any government to form, something that happens relatively regularly in continental Europe and could lead to another election. The U.K. was set to began negotiating the two-year period of exiting the EU within two weeks, and the longer it takes for a new administration to form, the longer the clock ticks.
""Another election could be pursued later this year. This injects huge uncertainty into markets and will lead to volatility,"" said Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM. ""In our view, this is the worst possible outcome for the markets in the short term.""
Though the U.K. can ask for the two-year negotiation period to be extended, that would require the unanimous agreement of all EU states.
""The longer this goes without a resolution, the more uncertainty there is,"" said Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING, who sees the pound falling to $1.25 or $1.24 under that scenario.

HSBC,British Banks Brace for Election Wobble; U.K. economic growth slowed in the first quarter as consumers pared back spending," Jun 10, 2017",1,"LONDON--Shares in Britain's banks fell Friday on worries about the economy faltering in an uncertain U.K. political climate.
Prime Minister Theresa May said she will form a government and is looking for support from the Democratic Unionist Party, a small Northern Irish party, after her Conservative party failed to win a majority in Thursday's snap election.
Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, Barclays PLC, Lloyds Banking Group PLC and other domestic lenders

only marginally improved from earlier losses following Prime Minister Theresa May's statement on Thursday's snap elections early Friday afternoon. The Euro Stoxx index was up 0.3%.
Bank analysts said consumer confidence could wobble if Britain's plan to leave the European Union is delayed or threatened by the political instability. U.K. economic growth slowed in the first quarter as consumers pared back spending, and banks have been starting to pull back from a four-year lending binge in unsecured credit.
Chirantan Barua, an analyst at Bernstein, said the election could by a catalyst for draining excess liquidity from the banking system. He said the U.K. could find it hard to draw in capital and investments until the political situation clarifies.
Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland Group fell as much as 4% early Friday on the heightened chance of the main opposition party gaining power if a second election is needed. The Labour party in its election manifesto said it would break up RBS into smaller local lenders, which analyst say would prolong a nine-year effort to get the bank out from under 71% state support.
Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group fell 1% and Metro Bank fell 3%. Rising gilt yields would add to the banks's funding costs and squeeze margins.
A fall in sterling Friday was good news, though, for the U.K.'s Asia focused banks, HSBC and Standard Chartered. The two banks's stocks became cheaper to buy with dollars, and most of their revenues aren't in pounds. HSBC makes about 25% of its revenue in the U.K. while Standard Chartered has only minimal sterling-denominated revenues.

HSBC,Millions of Indian Businesses Will Soon Try Something New: Paying Taxes; Authorities to impose new system they hope will force millions of merchants to begin paying taxes," Jun 12, 2017",0,"
MUMBAI--India is bracing for a dramatic but risky overhaul of the country's tax system that authorities hope will draw millions of businesses into their tax net and boost the economy.
The initiative, set to kick off on July 1, aims to streamline India's cumbersome network of state and federal levies and ease commerce across state borders.
It is a big part of a larger effort, including the cancellation of large-denominated currencies last year, to improve tax collection from companies that make up India's huge informal economy. Some estimate the new system will add nearly 1 percentage point to India's GDP growth within a few years.
But the risks could drag on short-term economic growth, experts say. Among the hurdles are getting millions of companies to register, educating them on how to file online, poor internet connections and widespread tax avoidance. The design of the new nationwide Goods and Services Tax--which replaces a value-added tax and other levies--also is more complex than many expected.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 600 of 1177
A chaotic rollout could roil an economy still hobbled by a cash shortage caused by the elimination of the bank notes in November.
""This is one of the biggest changes we have undertaken since independence,"" said Neelkanth Mishra, India equity analyst at Credit Suisse.
The government says it will implement the tax on schedule, simplifying the tax structure and lifting the economy. India ranks 172nd out of 190 countries in the World Bank's ease of paying taxes index. It has one of the worst tax- to-GDP ratios in the world , at 16.6%, versus an OECD average of 34%. That deprives the government of revenue for much-needed improvements to education, health care, sanitation, infrastructure and other state priorities.
The new tax has already registered 80% of the 7 million current VAT business payers, the government says, and it hopes to bring in most of the rest. The challenge, experts say, will be registering millions of other small and medium-size enterprises in India that aren't registered.
Among the more than 160 countries that use a value-added tax, India's is among the most complex. It has four tax brackets, exemptions for products like petroleum and additional levies on luxury goods. It will split revenue between states and the central government. The rules are the result of years of wrangling between political parties, states and central government in the world's biggest democracy, a country of 1.2 billion people.
Kunal Kumar Kundu, analyst at Socie?te? Ge?ne?rale, called it ""the world's most complicated VAT framework,"" saying that compliance will likely be burdensome, particularly for small businesses. HSBC initially projected that the system would add 0.8% to India's GDP growth but halved its projection after the government announced the multiple tax brackets.
""It's not ideal,"" said Pranjul Bhandari, HSBC's chief economist for India.
The new system requires most businesses with annual revenue above 2 million rupees ($31,000) to upload their invoices every month to a portal that will need to be stable enough to accept billions of documents.
""I don't know whether [policy makers] know the complications in a small trade,"" said Biju John, a rubber dealer in the southern state of Kerala. ""We are in rural areas, where internet connectivity is poor.""
Businesses' invoices will be matched with those of their suppliers or vendors, who must provide their tax number before they can claim a credit. Analysts commend the use of peer pressure to make businesses comply.
""The government has made you the tax collector,"" Uday Pimprikar, a partner at Ernst and Young who specializes in indirect taxation told a seminar hall packed with business owners and accountants in Mumbai this month.
At scenes like this playing out across the country, merchants anxiously ask questions and voice hopes the government will delay implementation. Many businesses say they are still awaiting guidance on how the new tax will work.
""There are no clear insights given on how to process"" it, said Parag Malde, owner of Jupiter Impex, a textile company in Mumbai.
As the registration deadline looms, some businesses say they plan to stop taking orders while the tax is implemented. Others say they will wait to see what happens.
""Even our accountants are clueless on how to comply with the rules,"" said Naresh Patel, owner of R&D Plastics in the western city of Ahmedabad. ""It will likely be a painful transition for us.""
Ankit Tanna, director of Mumbai-based printing company Printmann group, said his company sent three reminders to suppliers to register.
""We told them: 'If by June 15 we do not have a [tax] number from you, we will be discontinuing our orders.'""
Two of his staff have helped vendors register. ""A teacher can only teach, ultimately,"" but it is up to them to comply, Mr. Tanna said.
Once in place, the system will create a single market, potentially allowing global companies like Unilever, Amazon and Nestle? to consolidate operations.
Wal-Mart India this month said it was setting up a new tax helpline for the mom-and-pop shops that buy goods from its wholesaling business. The company said it wanted to help all its partners make a smooth transition to the new system. Amazon said it was conducting tax webinars for sellers and had produced written and video guides

for them.
But few expect implementation to be easy.
""India is trying to attempt what some of the leading economies do not have,"" said Abhay Laijawala, head of India equities research for Deutsche Bank. ""Even the United States does not have"" such a system.

HSBC,Palladium Rally Could HitaWall," Jun 12, 2017",0,"PALLADIUM PRICES SURGED TO MULTIYEAR HIGHS LAST WEEK, BUT MORE PESSIMISM in the auto industry and a pile-in by speculators suggest that the rally is getting exhausted.
The gains have outpaced those of all other precious metals this year, with the most active palladium futures contract rising 25% year to date compared with golds 10% gain. The ETFS Physical Palladium Shares exchange- traded fund (ticker: PALL) is up 29% this year.
Partly driving the outsize returns has been increased consumption in the past few years by auto manufacturers, which use palladium in the catalytic converters that filter car emissions. According to the researchers at GFMS Thomson Reuters, palladium demand in auto-catalyst applications hit an all-time high for the fifth consecutive year in 2016, rising by 5% annually.
That combined with mine closures has caused palladium supply to fall short of demand for the past couple of years, a trend that analysts expect to continue in 2017.
Weaker auto sales this year could put a damper on the demand for the metal. According to Autodata, total U.S. light-vehicle sales fell 0.5% in May year over year, and are down 2% year to date, compared with 2016. On Thursday, Morgan Stanley cut its U.S. auto sales forecasts through 2020 based on an unprecedented buyers strike.
Car sales in China have also slowed this year after growing at the fastest pace in three years in 2016. A government tax incentive for auto buyers led sales to a record monthly high in November. However, cutting the tax break has weighed on sales growth this year.
While palladium is a precious metal, the majority of demand comes from its use in vehicles. Therefore, the lukewarm outlook for auto sales should soon take a toll on prices, analysts said. Rising prices in the face of weak data this year also suggest that the market could be vulnerable to a short-term correction. Prices closed at $856.20 an ounce on Friday, the highest level since September 9, 2014. Theyve closed higher in 10 out of the last 11 sessions.
Usually, the palladium market reacts quite sensitively to this news, says Carsten Menke, commodity analyst at Julius Baer. We think that eventually this slowdown in global car sales should translate into lower palladium prices.
The concerns are compounded by signs that the recent price gains have been driven by speculative investors, which could turn the market quickly if they decide to unwind long positions on palladium futures. The palladium market is also dwarfed in size by other metals, like gold and copper, so it takes fewer participants to trigger a major move.
Menke says that when palladium for industrial use is more expensive than bars bought by investors, it indicates higher demand from auto manufacturers. But the current lack of a premium suggests that the need for palladium in catalytic converters is not as strong as some might think.
It really seems like theres a lot of speculation going on in the market, Menke says. Historically, across most
  PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 608 of 1177
commodities we observe, [that has] been a warning sign, he notes.
Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission show that net long positions by speculative investors reached the highest level since 2014 in early May. As of June 6, bullish bets outnumbered bearish bets by more than 23,559 contracts, hovering near the high of 23,570 contracts reached last month.
According to Soci?t? G?n?rale, palladium has attracted more than double the investment flows in futures and exchange-traded products than its precious metals peer platinum this year. Most of the overall flow Soci?t? G?n?rale Commodity Indexes, is tracking is coming from futures. Holdings in palladium Barrons.com ETFs have been declining, falling below 1.5 million ounces for the first time since 2010, according to Commerzbank. We therefore find it hard to understand why the palladium price in particular is so strong, analysts wrote last week. Industrial demand for palladium also faces risks such as substitution and a growing scrap-metal market. An annual survey from GFMS Thomson reported that auto-catalyst scrap supply rose to the second-highest level on record in 2016, which helped mitigate the loss of material from mine disruptions. As palladium prices have risen, platinum has been selling off, raising the possibility that platinum will become a substitute if it becomes the cheaper of the two. That would also cap palladium demand. Still, analysts cautioned that any switch would take a long time to implement.
In our view, it is more a case of when, not if, the palladium price will exceed platinum for the first time since 2001, says Ross Strachan, precious-metals demand manager at Thomson Reuters, in a May report. However, we think that the recent move has been too far and too fast.
These factors have led analysts to suggest that investors re-evaluate their shortterm positions, but fundamental supply and demand looks steady over the next year.
We are getting close to where we think a reasonable high for the market might be, says James Steel, chief precious-metals analyst at HSBC Securities in New York, who added that palladium prices still may reach as high as $870 an ounce this year. It might be getting a bit toppy.. .but thats not to say were not bullish longer term. ?

bullish guidance that sends the shares to a record high.
Veteran airline investor Bill Franke is chairman of Wizz Air, a low-cost carrier focused on previously neglected Eastern European routes such as Gdansk to Grenoble and Katowice to Kiev. The 80-year-old Texan was also, until Thursday, its anchor shareholder, with a 19% stake through private-equity vehicle Indigo.
On Thursday, Indigo sold all its ordinary stock to institutions for £249 million ($317.7 million) or £23.20 a share-- only a slight discount to Wednesday's closing price, which was a record. He retains convertible stock and notes that, if converted, would give him a 54% economic interest.
Indigo initially outlined plans to float Wizz in 2014, but was forced to scrap them due to ""market volatility in the airline sector."" It finally got the initial public offering off the ground in 2015. Then terrorist attacks and other problems hit European airline demand just as cheap oil fueled a renewed push for scale. Wizz Air's share price struggled to make headway last year .
Sentiment has recovered this year. But Wizz stock only regained its 2015 highs three weeks ago, after the company wowed the Street with bullish guidance in annual results. The shares finished the day up 13%. ""Particularly surprising,"" noted brokerage HSBC, was Wizz's expectation of growth in unit revenues--essentially airfares. Its key peer, Ryanair, expects a 5% to 7% decline in fares over the same fiscal year through March 2018. Don't be surprised if Wizz's future guidance features a new note of caution.

The fund company, a subsidiary of Bedminster, N.J.-based Precidian Investments, plans a series of 19 funds that will invest in American depositary receipts, or ADRs, shares of foreign corporations that are traded in the U.S., according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing this past week . The funds, which the firm is calling ADRPLUS, would also invest in derivatives contracts designed to minimize the impact of the exchange-rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the local currency of the foreign security.
ADRs offer U.S. investors exposure to foreign stocks, but also expose them to the fluctuations in the security's local currency. A U.S. investor who buys a Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. ADR, for example, may lose money even if the stock price doesn't fluctuate but the yen declines versus the dollar.
Precidian filed for an ADRPLUS fund structure in 2014, but never launched any funds by that name. The latest regulatory filing doesn't disclose which exchange the funds would trade on or divulge any fee information. It is still possible the SEC could reject the latest application or request changes.
The planned ETFs would offer access to ADRs of 19 companies including AstraZeneca PLC, HSBC Holdings PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC. They would be structured as grantor trusts in order to qualify as an investment fund under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which says a fund must offer a degree of diversity in its investments, which these funds would lack. (SPDR Gold Shares, which invests only in gold bullion bars, is an example of a grantor trust.)
The current filing shows ""an enormously clever use of the structure,"" says David Nadig, chief executive of ETF.com. ""They're very unique and single purpose; they're really pretty plain vanilla ETFs,"" which are likely to be used by a fairly narrow set of investors--stock pickers who aren't managing such an enormous portfolio that they can afford to manage a currency book against it, Mr. Nadig says. ""There's a convenience factor here which might appeal to hedge funds or those managing on a short-term basis"" like day traders, he says.
But Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar Inc., called the proposed funds ""a solution in search of a problem.""
""In practice, people are moving away from picking individual stocks,"" Mr. Johnson says. ""I just don't think there's a

market for it. I've never met anybody who said, 'I want to put more of my money into Toyota shares; if only I could invest in an ETF that would hedge out the currency for me.' ""

HSBC,Argentina to Sell Its First 100-Year Bonds; Country had been locked out of international capital markets until last year," Jun 19, 2017",1,"Argentina is preparing to sell 100-year bonds with a yield of 8.25%, according to people familiar with the matter. The private placement offering could price as soon as Monday and would mark the first time the South American nation has sold 100-year debt, these people said.
A sale would mark another step in Argentina's turnaround, as before last year, the country largely was locked out of international capital markets after defaulting in 2001 on about $80 billion. At the time, it was the largest sovereign default in history.
There is expected to be robust local demand for the bonds after the country enacted new tax amnesty laws to encourage repatriation of funds stashed abroad, people close to the deal said.
The offering is led by Citigroup Inc and HSBC, with Nomura Securities Co. and Banco Santander as co-managers. The Argentine government is looking to raise about $2.4 billion from the bond sale, say people familiar with the offering. Proceeds will go toward the budget and refinancing existing debt.
With this deal, Argentina would join a small club of countries that have sold so-called century bonds, including Mexico, Ireland and the U.K.

Chicago Fed President Charles Evans sat down with Wall Street Journal reporters on Tuesday in New York and discussed a variety of issues facing the central bank, including the outlook for interest rate rises and the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a time of weak inflation. He also took answered questions on banking sector issues, productivity and Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen's performance in office.
Here is a transcript of the exchange, lightly edited for length and clarity -- By Michael S. Derby
Q: So I was just asking about inflation and the weakness of inflation that we've seen over the last few months, and, you know, whether or not that calls into question whether the Fed will be able to deliver on its forecast of around one more rate rise. How long do you need to see the inflation trend pick up from where we are right now before you could support another rate rise this year?
MR. EVANS: Well, I think it's very important that, you know, the Federal Reserve support the economy and support inflation rising to our 2% objective. We have said that we've got a 2% objective going back to 2012 January, our Policy Strategy Statement, and everybody sort of understood 2% for a longer period of time is our objective. We have not hit it in that time period. There have been a lot of reasons why: aftermath of the great financial crisis and disinflationary tendencies. But more recently, inflation has been moving up from, you know, below 1% at one point, core inflation started moving up, and, you know, we've increased the funds rate by 100 basis points. And so we've, you know, come off the zero floor and, you know, moved up to, you know, 1 1/8 average.
So that's good, but that's all premised on an outlook where the economy is doing well. Unemployment's 4.3%. Looking for growth in the 2 1?4% range, which is above trend - trend is more like 1 3?4, and that's been enough to drive unemployment down. But inflation--which had been moving up off of its 1 1?4, 1.4 year over year--was moving up. And now, most recently, the last three months have been quite disappointing. There's no other way to describe
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 621 of 1177
that, I would say. Some of it looks like it's seemingly one-off effects from cellphone company data plans and things like that. So maybe it's explainable, and maybe next month and the month after that we'll revert back to better inflation. I think that means--for me, I know it means--you know, it's time to assess, you know, what the state of inflation is and whether or not we're really going to move up to 2%.
So the premise of your question was does this mean that we can continue raising rates. You know, the median of the (Summary of Economic Projections) is for three rate increases this year. We've done two. I think that, you know, we're now at a point where, you know, we can--we can afford--having raised the rate twice, we can afford to sort of wait a little bit and see how the data play out. There's a lot going on with uncertainty, the economy--global economy's doing better--but to see if inflation's going to move up.
I think we could wait until the end of the year. December is another SEP round, press conference, and that would be the time where we could decide three rate increases, two rate increases. To get to four, we'd have to do something before that, obviously. And for me, I think, boy, you know, if we saw better inflation and the unemployment rate, you know, continuing to move down, yeah, OK, I could see that. But that's not in my outlook at the moment.
Q: OK. So, I mean, you're willing to wait awhile to see if the inflation data do perk back up? I mean, I guess what you're saying is the Fed definitely has time to make a call on its next rate move.
MR. EVANS: I think so. And that's also--you know, that's also in the median SEP projection. You know, the median is for three rate increases. We don't say when they're going to take place. That's not the nature of the exercise. And if we got that in in December, that would be three. But it also affords the optionality of, in December, kind of seeing, gee, you know, unemployment--inflation's not picking up, there's something else going on. If unemployment continues to move down, there's this tension between a very strong labor market, history with inflation likely around the corner, maybe it's going to come. It's just that we've had a bit too many experiences of forecasting an upturn in inflation, having a good reason for forecasting that, and it hasn't taken place.
Q: If you did wait until the end of the year--if conditions cause you to wait until the end of the year, would that affect the balance-sheet plan? Because that--you know, in the new agenda, it's hopefully this year you're going to do that. But if you wait until December to raise rates because that's what the economy calls for, would that push the balance-sheet plan into 2018?
MR. EVANS: Doesn't have to. So the chair has spoken well on this at her press conference. We've released, you know, an addendum to our normalization guidelines, you know, on this. And so now we've indicated that, you know, we've looked at this, you know, quite carefully, and the current expectation is we put together--we have this plan, and when we decide it's time to start reducing our balance sheet that we'll begin taking $10 billion of assets off our balance sheet each month--basically, that's what the cap means: 6 Treasury, 4 MBS--for the first quarter, and then that would increase by 10 billion each quarter until we get to 50 billion. That's enough to start reducing the balance sheet in a meaningful, noticeable way, but not too quickly. And, you know, we can do that at any point.
I personally think, and I think most people think, that once this starts it can be running in the background. Markets will understand. They understand the plan now. Most of the action on the term premia, I think, comes from understanding the plan. It's all priced in, and you can see it run off.
One way to do it, you know, (New York Fed President William) Dudley...has said, you know, maybe we make an action on the balance sheet at a meeting where we don't have to change the funds rate. That would be a way to take the balance sheet, get that started, and position ourselves for a December rate increase. That's one possibility. There are others. But this is one that allows that optionality that, at the moment, I prefer.
Q: And when officials say that -- (the process of shrinking the balance sheet will)--start when interest rate normalization is ""well under way,"" what is implied by ""well under way?"" Are we there now with this latest rate increase?
MR. EVANS: ""Well under way,"" obviously, came to be a heavily laden term. Whenever you do qualitative guidance, it sort of takes that on. I know a number of people have thought about what's the level of the funds rate at which it must obviously be well under way, and you can go through a number of thought exercises on that. And they might
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 622 of 1177

be somewhat north of where we are. But I think, in general, we've increased the funds rate by 100 basis points. The first time we did it, events didn't work out; that is, uncertainty internationally in 2016. An awful lot of things happened: Brexit, China volatility, and all of that. So, you know, we delayed until last December. Now we've done three in a row.
I mean, you know, things are pretty in train at the moment. I recognize that's not the same term. But I think we're at the point where we can make a decision to start adjusting the balance sheet at any time at this point.
Q: And in September it seems like there's a prospect, again, for...fiscal collisions in Washington, debt-limit high jinks. Would that affect your timing at all if you got into September and, you know, there was uncertainty over what's going to happen there?
MR. EVANS: That's a good question. I'm not an expert on the exact interactions of what we do with the Treasury markets. Obviously, we care about well-functioning Treasury markets, and so, you know, if there are concerns we'd have to think about that. But, you know, at the moment, I'm, you know, not really that aware of exactly how that would play out. At some point, once--you know, once Congress and the president get talking about the debt ceiling, sometimes this goes on for quite some period of time, sometimes it's resolved more quickly. So, you know, it's just difficult to--you know, if you let that, you know, stop you, then you almost stop planning or whatnot. So I think we can continue to plan along these lines.
I think, as it turns out, rolling off $10 billion -- $6 billion of Treasurys, those are actually assets that markets would like to have available to them during, you know, times where they value safe assets. So I don't think it presents too many problems. But, again, I'm not expert, and I do know that people are concerned about that.
Q: You mentioned one-off factors sort of dragging down inflation over the last few months. Do you expect all those one-off factors to sort of go away altogether? Or is there ever a circumstance in which there are not one-off factors that are weighing on inflation or otherwise?
MR. EVANS: It's a good--yeah. So once you start picking apart pieces of the price index--you know, I think it was (former Cleveland Fed President) Jerry Jordan who way back in the '90s had some comment like, you know, once you start diving into the elements of the price index, you begin to convince yourself that the price report creates its own inflation or whatnot. I mean, you can just, you know, pick out what you like. Back when tobacco prices were going up a lot due to the legal settlement, there used to be, you know, core, eggs, food, energy and tobacco prices. And so it's easy to do this.
I think there's a good case that these are one-off. How many times are the, you know, phone companies going to change the data plans and things like that? Maybe it's a once and for all type of change. I'm a little more--you know, I'd like to reflect on this a little bit more because, you know, the same technology, you know, at the moment is changing all the time. It's changing in ways that are not easy to understand. It's not exactly the late '90s, when durable goods manufacturing technology was roaring along, and, you know, digital technology was finding its way on the factory work floor and offices in a big, big way in a very positive, broad fashion.
Now, it's more disruptive. More corporations are choosing to merge, ones that you wouldn't have thought of necessarily. You could have been farsighted and seen that, but others, you know, not so much. And it makes you wonder if competition is beginning to take place along lines that haven't been contemplated. Competition, you know, in many forms would adjust price margins. Price margin adjustment would lead to lower price levels for-- relative prices. But you get enough of these relative prices and it finds its way into the price index, unless the stance of monetary policy is sufficiently accommodative to overcome that.
And so that would be the what if it's not exactly one-off. Well, globally inflation has been low. One of the commonalities across the globe--now, we've all suffered from the great financial crisis, OK. Governments haven't responded full force with fiscal actions in many cases, OK. I mean, there are common approaches that have been taken that could account for it. But technology is affecting the global economy as well, and demographics. And so it's a--it's a very challenging time to say with certainty, yeah, I know it's one-off.
Rather, it's really more--I mean, in fairness to the other viewpoint, I think it's that labor markets are doing quite well. Unemployment rate's 4.3%. Labor force has been--participation rate has been declining. And there are a lot of
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 623 of 1177

demographic reasons for that. Maybe we'd all prefer more people in the workforce so that we could grow faster, but people are voluntarily making these choices and people are getting older, and a whole host of demographic reasons. So I mean, I think that's kind of what we face. The unemployment rate's falling.
And, you know, historically vibrant labor markets, accommodative Fed, go back to the '70s and you kind of recoil with fear over that. I think it's a very different world. I think the state of inflation expectations are very different now. But, you know, you'd have to be not really thinking very carefully to be oblivious to that possibility. So I think there are risks on both sides.
Q: What do you view as banks' role right now in the economy? Are they lending enough? Are they overregulated? Would you advise any tweaking there to get better economic performance?
MR. EVANS: Well, I mean, I--you know, I think bank lending is taking place, you know, reasonably well. I don't think that--you know, so at the moment, you know, banks have had a chance to rebuild their capital. The demands on them to have capital in place are stronger, higher than they were before the financial crisis. You know, you can argue over exactly how limiting that is for bank lending. You know, there is some research that indicates that banks that have more capital end up being more profitable and do more lending. That's not your first reaction, I think, to the fact that more leverage usually ends up with more lending. But I think the current circumstances are, you know, pretty good for the financial sector.
Regulatory burden, yeah, I mean, it's definitely higher than it was before the crisis. It was probably, you know, given the fact that we got ourselves into a financial crisis, it was probably too low. It could easily be, you know, higher now, and then part of the question would be what type of adjustments. I think community bankers have always feared that Dodd-Frank, even with certain carve-outs, you know, the attitude of regulators and supervisors would be to just, you know, wash all of that across the spectrum of the size of banks, and that they would end up being more regulated than even their expectations, you know, from the law.
I was always, you know, a little, frankly, skeptical of that. But, you know, in fact, I've heard more and more and, you know, I think that that is sort of an issue. So, you know, the Fed has started, you know, tailoring some of these requirements so that the community banks aren't affected to the same degree. But, you know, it's a judgment call and certainly some things, you know, could be done. But I do think that for the largest financial institutions that, you know, are systemically important more and better capital serves everybody better. You know, having the appropriate liquidity on hand in the face of difficult liquidity times, I think, is important.
And I think that the stress tests have served us all pretty well. Part of the stress test involves doing horizontal reviews, and then sort of sharing the outcomes of that, having feedback with the supervisors. I know it's painful, but at some point a little more gets shared about, you know, I think ways to have some capital in place or some liquidity in place against certain alternatives that help people think about that. But you can certainly go further than his ideal.
Q: Your banks that you supervise, do any go through the stress test?
MR. EVANS: Yeah. Yeah, they're not part of the highest (Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee) banks. But they're the large financial banking organizations, the next tier down. And over 50 billion. And also with a global presence, custody banks, Northern Trust. We supervise HSBC as well. And Allied Bank.
Q: You seemed to hint at the question of productivity just a little bit earlier. Where do you come out on the productivity paradox? Any new evidence that says, so, it's there we just can't see it, or the opposite side of the question?
MR. EVANS: Productivity's always difficult to measure. So it's definitely possible that there's stronger productivity likely to emerge in certain areas more narrowly than broadly, you know, everywhere. I think that, you know, the 10- year period from '95 to 2005 was just an extraordinary period for productivity. We had a productivity slow down before that. There are two different five-year periods in that 10-year period. The '95 to 2000 period was one where capital embodied technology really improved a lot. It's that durable goods manufacturing, computers, you know, finally finding its way into offices. The computer had been around for quite some time before that. And you saw noticeable acceleration of productivity.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 624 of 1177

And then after Y2K, you didn't see that same type of productivity, but you saw what economists refer to as total factor productivity, which is the residual, after accounting for capital and labor input, growth. And that's just business process and improvement. Businesses that--things had done so well in the previous five years, they left a lot of things, inefficiencies dangling because they were too busy doing other things. And so they cleaned that up and we saw that, you know, really improve for five years. For 10 years, that was a great productivity period.
Then, you know, somewhere, and the financial crisis gets--you know, confuses things as to when the real slowdown was. So now we're stepping back down to something probably a little higher than the productivity slowdown in the areas of 73 to 95, but not nearly like the previous 10 years. Maybe it's better. Maybe it's improving. But at the moment it's disruptive. So in the places where you see a lot of productivity increase, you see other capital investments just depreciate, because they're not profitable in the same way.
Q: Do you guys talk about driverless cars?
MR. EVANS: Us guys who? I mean, you know, at the (Federal Open Market Committee) level? Yeah, you know, somebody might make a comment, but not very much at the--at my board-of-directors level, a little bit more; at a business advisory group, a lot more. And in Chicago, we've had a couple of gatherings with people engaged in startups, the technology incubation centers in Chicago and what not. They'll talk a lot about driverless cars.
Q: Detroit's in your region.
MR. EVANS: Oh, sure. Yeah, Detroit's in our region. You know, everybody's thinking about driverless cars; insurance companies. It's going to be so safe. Who's going to have an insurance policy? There are just a whole bunch of things I don't understand; just the mere fact that you've got some driverless cars on the same road with people who are driving, who like driving.
Q: Yeah, but one day--if you take that, one day it will be illegal to drive a car as a person.
MR. EVANS: This - this is a country of freedom and liberty. (Laughter.) And I don't really understand that. But OK.
Q: No, one day, however many decades out from here. You're too much of a danger.
MR. EVANS: In Oklahoma is that going to be the case? I mean, there's an awful lot--I mean, in a city, I understand this.
Q: So, just given where you think productivity is, where do you think trend (gross domestic product growth) is going to be?
MR. EVANS: A nice round number I usually say is 1 3?4. Some people are now at 1 1?2, which is a very politically fraught discussion. I mean, I--you know, I gave a speech--beginning of last year? No, I think it was two years ago--a bankers' group in Wisconsin. And I started rolling out the, you know, have you heard about the demographics in the labor force? And, you know, this is meaning--this means that labor input's just not going to grow as much as it did before. And then productivity isn't so good. So, you know, we're kind of thinking that growth is likely to be 1 3?4.
And then in the audience afterwards there was somebody from the state government, not at the highest levels, and, you know, the person said afterwards, you know, you know, I heard what you said, and it made a lot of sense. I just wish, instead of 1 3?4, you could have said 4%, to which I said me too, because, you know, growth solves an awful lot of problems. And it would be good if we could get 4%. But where does it come from? We're talking about two very difficult areas. One is productivity. I'm sorry--I think last night we were talking about our poor state of inflation forecasting or things that we don't know so well; you know, inflation dynamics.
You know, economists--you know, you could stump--you could get them to admit under oath that--not even under oath; in a conversation--that we don't understand a lot of things in productivity, where it comes from. You know, (economist Robert) Solow said that Solow residual was the measure of our ignorance about productivity, after accounting for capital and labor growth.
Research and development helps, OK, but the relationship is, you know, probably about up there with the Phillips curve and things like that. So we'd all like to see stronger productivity growth. And I think if you let people innovate, you know, don't get in their way too much, that you get better results. But, I mean, you're probably only going to get so much. And it's really the labor input that is the most limiting of all of this.
Go back to the '80s, when we saw very strong trend growth, over 3% probably, and there were a lot of people
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 625 of 1177

coming into the workforce, continuing to come in. And that just added to the growth numbers. Now that's not likely to continue, and especially as you adjust immigration policies and things like that. That only makes it more difficult.
So you put those two things together, and 1 3?4, you know, is a very realistic estimate. Could it be 2 1?4? Could be, but it probably requires an awful lot of lift.
Q: How worried are you about restrictive immigration and trade policies even creating further headwinds to getting a better GDP number?
MR. EVANS: Yeah, I think--I think--yeah, I'm nervous about that. I mean, I think that we need--we need a vibrant labor market. We need an economy where we're adding to labor-force growth, however we get there. But, you know, we need to get that. I think that most of the people who've left the labor force for demographic reasons--you know, men, as they get older, have less of an attachment to the labor force. You know, every five-year bucket as they get older, they, you know, sort of choose randomly or however not to participate, you know, quite as much. And, you know, you go through all of that. You're just not likely to see the strong growth rates that we saw in the '80s, and even the '90s, unless some other spark is introduced.
Q: What are you hearing from businesses in your district about immigration?
MR. EVANS: We don't--we don't really hear a lot of comments about immigration, not per se.
Q: So you're not hearing anything about sort of, you know, restrictions and a lot of the stuff that's happening? Particularly in the Chicago area, it seems like there's been some activity.
MR. EVANS: Yeah, that topic just doesn't come up very much. I'm sure that pharmaceutical companies, others-- they're probably H-1B visas or, you know, probably resource-constrained. But people don't really talk about that. You do--you do always hear that it's just hard to find skilled workers, high-skilled workers, that type of thing. That's been going on for a long time; continues to go on. And some of it's probably forecastable; I mean, people who say that we've known for a long time that welders were going to be retiring and nobody really beefed up the pipeline of training welders. Nobody was interested in the details of that. But the higher-skilled digital technology, I think it's very challenging. And the interaction with immigration, visas, is not helpful.
Q: Just on the unknowns side of things, just to come back to the balance sheet, how much time do you think you need to give the market between some kind of reveal that things are going to get, you know, started, versus we are now starting? I think this--I don't think Chair Yellen answered the question about whether the announcement and something forthcoming would be a month apart or maybe three months apart. And I know there's been some discussion of the phasing in of that. I just wondered how much time you feel you need to give the market between point A and point B, particularly the mortgage market, which may need a little bit more time than the Treasury market.
MR. EVANS: Yeah. I read her transcript. I guess I didn't take strong note of the issue that you're pointing to.
For me, I think that we've laid out as much detail on this as anybody needs to sort of understand what they would be facing in terms of additional supply coming on the market from us, not reinvesting fully everything that matures. We've announced that it's going to be a very slow start. Treasurys, I think, are the easiest. The (mortgage- backed securities) is more complicated. There's a lot of (inaudible) action and things like that.
But I think that, you know, the New York desk will have additional commentary looking at the, you know, maturity structure of Treasurys. I, you know, had to even ask my staff sort of like, when we talk about reinvesting or rolling over, and how does that get distributed? And one of the answers I got back was, oh, it's the same way we're doing now, it's just a little bit less of it. Which kind of reminded me I hadn't be paying attention to all of the details of three- to five-year, you know, notes maturity and things like that. So I think the markets probably, you know--I can't imagine why the markets don't understand on the basis of what we've already laid out.
Q: They do, but I think there's, like, another--there's another widening that might come when you actually get started, so.
Q: I mean, like, let's say you start--let's say you decide you're going to start on November 1st. When do you say-- when do you tell folks, hey, we're going to start this on November 1st? Is that sort of what you're trying to get at?
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 626 of 1177

Q: It's sort of the--whether it's flush, in the same meeting, or whether there's like a month's gap or even two months of a gap, bearing in mind there's, you know, a potential rate increase in December and you might not want to do two things overlapping in the same meeting.
MR. EVANS: Oh, you know, some things are--some things, in my mind, are a little bit more of a detail orientation, and I trust the New York Desk, you know, to keep people--to be, you know, advertising and consulting with, you know, big--you know, a whole bunch of people who are affected by this. I think that a lot of work has already been done. Speeches have been given.
I think that it could be done just by we go into a meeting and then we say we've just decided that we're going to do this, and, you know, perhaps it begins, you know, whatever the 1st of the next month is, something like that. Or it could be that it's decided and then we say, you know, a couple of months. I guess if we found ourselves in--unsure about the Treasury discussions over the debt ceiling, it could be that we make an announcement and then it's, you know, got a little bit of a delay. But I'm not quite sure why that would have to be very long.
Q: There's a high bar to not continuing the rate rising campaign, but is there as much of a high bar to not continuing the balance-sheet actions? I mean, what would make you hold off this year--from this year?
MR. EVANS: Yeah, I think of it this way. I'm not really expecting--oh, people involved in the markets, it's definitely going to be a change from what they've been doing. But in terms of the overall financial situation and the way the economy and pricing is going to be, I just don't think it's a very big effect quickly. And the fact that it's going to take place over more than three years I think people can understand, and how it's going to build.
According to our estimates of term premia, which have gone down due to the size of our balance sheet, we've got some estimates--the balance sheet is only going to change slowly. It's not going to be in a surprise fashion. So, you know, one would think the taper tantrums that happened back in the spring and summer of 2013, nobody should be wrong-footed, you know, because they didn't expect this. I mean, if they weren't paying attention, somebody-- you know, people have to be accountable for things like that. But I think that there's been enough talking and planning over this that it should go smoothly. And I think that it's the kind of thing that can run in the background and not have a tremendous effect on adjusting the stance of financial restrictiveness. So I think that it could take place.
The hurdle for not doing that, I think, could be quite high, given that we've said, you know, we expect to do this this year. The hurdle for not making a funds rate adjustment, that I think is actually the live option if you think that something is happening with the economy or inflation that you weren't expecting. Having said that, I think everybody's forecast expectation for the economy is strong fundamentals, continued growth, continued improvement in labor markets, and, you know, two, three, maybe four rate hikes this year.
Q: So when the balance-sheet action does start happening, you're not necessarily expecting to see, say, yields start to just push up higher? That's not something you necessarily expect to see happen?
MR. EVANS: I would not expect that. I do not expect that. Can't rule anything out, of course.
And, you know, I mean, the challenges with financial markets and yields--you know, last night there was the question about the 10-year Treasury rate's come down a lot and, you know, what do you think about that. And you have to stop and remember that the Treasury--10-year Treasury rate was, you know, quite low until the election, and then the election, and then optimism from the business community about, you know, tax plans and regulatory relief and things like that, and, you know, 10-year rates shot up by a considerable amount, and they continue to build for a while. You know, then you have, you know, more British discussions about Brexit, elections, things like that; U.S. is a safe haven; people have slightly different expectations of legislative activity in Washington; and, you know, 10-year rates move down.
Now, how much of that is because of our actions? Probably not much, if any. How much of it is everything else going on? I'm in the everything else going on camp. But that's a big bucket, so.
Q: It seems like there's an effort to--you know, once this thing is put into motion, to have it go sort of automatically in the background. Is there sort of--what would have to happen to kind of take the balance-sheet reduction off this automated path?

MR. EVANS: Yeah, so once we get started--you know, and we expect that it can take place in the background--as we, you know, find ourselves confronting different expectations for the economic growth, the labor market, or inflation, our first tool, I would say, is adjusting the funds rate. So, if we see more inflation and we can go a little-- need to go faster, unemployment rate goes down lower, we can, you know, adjust upwards the funds rate path. If we're not seeing progress on inflation, we don't go as fast.
You know, if something more unexpected and negative happened and we needed to provide more accommodation, you could--you could first think about reducing the funds rate. Now, this is not my expectation at all; you know, not the most likely event. But you could still adjust the interest rate and not necessarily make any adjustments to the balance sheet. But if you think that you're at risk of something much deeper than that and you expect that you might hit the zero lower bound--because we're only at 1 1/8 right now--then, yeah, you could easily stop the balance sheet, and you could even choose to add assets if you were in very unfortunate circumstances. But, of course, that's the full toolkit on display, not what I'm expecting.
Q: Do you reckon whenever the next recession comes around that there's going to be the balance sheet--adjusting the balance sheet is going to be part of the reaction?
MR. EVANS: So I spend most of my time speaking in public about how difficult the risks of the zero lower bound are for monetary policy. I think that when we get down to zero, it's a very challenging environment. I think that when other government actors don't choose to take actions which help provide additional aggregate dem"

HSBC,China Companies to Get Greater Global Scrutiny After MSCI Lays Out Red Carpet; Inclusion of mainland China markets in major benchmark indexes is expected to lead to global investors focusing on corporate governance," Jun 21, 2017",1,"Correction Kevin Anderson is head of investments for Asia-Pacific at State Street Global Advisors. An earlier version of this article incorrectly called the firm State Street Global Investors. (June 21)
MSCI Inc.'s decision to include mainland Chinese shares in its global benchmarks for the first time could prompt changes to how companies are run, even if the initial amount of capital inflows won't be enough to effect a sizable shift in the country's markets, analysts and brokers said.
One of the world's leading index providers, MSCI said it would admit 222 Chinese stocks to benchmarks such as its Emerging Markets Index, which is tracked by funds with some $1.6 trillion of assets under management world- wide.
The approval--which came prior to the start of Chinese stock trading Wednesday, and followed three years of rejections by MSCI--
drew a muted reaction from mainland investors . The Shanghai Composite Index closed up 0.5%, while its Shenzhen counterpart gained 0.4%.
The tepid response was viewed in the market as a reflection of the relative caution apparent in MSCI's decision. After discussions with major fund managers including BlackRock Inc., the index provider said it would admit roughly half the largest number of companies it had considered including in past years.
MSCI estimates some $17 billion will flow into Chinese markets--both from passive funds that automatically track its indexes and active fund managers--when the country's stocks are included a year from now. That is a fraction of the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets' combined $7.5 trillion market capitalization.
Still, the decision was heralded by market participants who have long salivated over the prospect of gaining greater access to the world's second-largest economy . The move could change the way that global investors look at China, said Chin-Ping Chia, head of research for Asia-Pacific at MSCI.
""It's about the opening of a new phase of emerging-market investing,"" he said. ""The opening of the Great Wall, so to speak.""
Including Chinese stocks in MSCI benchmarks will have ""far-reaching implications"" for global equity investors, said Rakesh Patel, head of equities for Asia-Pacific at HSBC. He said some $500 billion could flow into Chinese markets in time, as they become more accessible and companies such as MSCI and FTSE Russell give a full weighting to Chinese stocks in their indexes.
The country's stock-market regulator, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said in a statement that the decision reflected confidence from global investors in the Chinese economy and financial markets.
The regulator also pledged to further revamp its capital markets. ""The Chinese capital market must welcome foreign investors more openly,"" it said.
In the year since MSCI's most recent rejection of Chinese stocks' inclusion in its indexes, the country has further opened up the Shenzhen market to global investors via a trading link with Hong Kong. It has also overhauled the rules governing share suspensions, making it more difficult for companies to halt trading in their shares.
One question for investors is whether having more shareholders from overseas will encourage greater transparency and better corporate governance at Chinese companies.
""Now that China's domestic stock market has become a member of the international family, it has become easier for us to have a dialogue with companies and regulators to express our views,"" said Victoria Mio, Hong Kong-based chief investment officer for China at asset manager Robeco.
Following MSCI's decision, global investor attention will focus on improvements in the quality of management at Chinese companies, said Kevin Anderson, head of investments for Asia-Pacific at State Street Global Advisors. ""There will now be a lens shone on Chinese companies, with an eye on improving shareholder value, corporate
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 630 of 1177
governance and returns from those companies,"" he said.
Yet others were less upbeat. Chinese stock markets ""still suffer from serious institutional shortcomings as well as heavy political influence,"" according to analysts at research firm Eurasia Group.
Since China's market crashes in 2015 and early 2016, the presence of state-backed investment funds in the market has risen in importance. Local traders say such funds often step in to buy or sell shares during periods of market volatility.
In addition, China's market regulator continues to exert strong control over the pace of initial public offerings. Despite recent revamps, the country's tight capital controls can still make it difficult for investors to move money across the border.
The MSCI decision is unlikely to lead to huge inflows of capital from abroad until China makes further changes to the structure of its capital markets, said Liu Weiming, Beijing-based chief investment officer at Fuxi Investment Management Co.
""Has MSCI given China a chicken wing to help it fly higher or is it just chicken ribs that carry little meat or value? I think it's chicken ribs,"" he said. ""If you don't make your home clean and tidy enough, how do you expect your guests to come for a visit?""

HSBC,"20 Years After Handover, China Looms Ever Larger Over Hong Kong Markets; Two decades after the handover, Chinese influence over Hong Kong's markets is far more striking than foreign investors' clout in China"," Jun 29, 2017",0,"HONG KONG--When China regained sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997 , the flourishing financial center seemed set to become a gateway for foreign investors to the then-largely closed mainland economy.
Two decades on, Chinese influence over Hong Kong's markets, rather than foreign investors' clout in China, is far more striking.
From the ever-rising activity of China's traders to the plethora of mainland companies listing on Hong Kong's stock exchange, China looms over Hong Kong's markets in a way few expect to dissipate in the coming years.
At the time of the handover, Beijing pledged to keep the former British colony as a largely independent entity for half a century. Less than halfway through that arrangement, Hong Kong--still one of Asia's leading financial markets, despite the rise of mainland rivals such as Shanghai--is increasingly being molded in China's image.
""The influence of the mainland is ubiquitous,"" says Paul Gruenwald, Asia-Pacific chief economist at S&P Global. One sign of China's importance to Hong Kong's markets is the shift in the largest constituents of the city's stock benchmark, the Hang Seng Index. Back in 1997, the index's biggest companies were either conglomerates owned by local tycoons or traditional British colonial firms, such as banking giant HSBC Holdings PLC.
Of the index's 10 biggest constituents by market capitalization then, only HSBC remains in its same form. Hutchison Whampoa and Cheung Kong Holdings, two companies 20 years ago, have since merged into CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd., which is in the top 10.
Today, the Hang Seng is dominated by state-owned lenders such as China Construction Bank Corp., Industrial &Commercial Bank of China Ltd. and Bank of China Ltd., which are also listed in Shanghai.
Chinese technology and telecom companies are a big presence, too. Tencent Holdings Ltd., the owner of China's largest social network, WeChat, holds the Hang Seng's largest weighting at 11%.
It isn't just the market leaders that have changed. In 1997, mainland Chinese companies, including those incorporated offshore, made up less than 20% of Hong Kong's market capitalization, according to Hong Kong Exchanges &Clearing Ltd., which operates the city's stock market.
Today, that number has ballooned to north of 60% and looks set to rise, given the high level of new listings in Hong Kong accounted for by mainland companies. Some 92% of the total volume of initial public offerings in the city was from Chinese companies last year, according to Goldman Sachs, helping Hong Kong retain its mantle as the world's most-popular venue for listings for the second consecutive year.
This trend has proved controversial. Companies from the mainland often have high investment from so-called cornerstone investors, who buy up large amounts of the company's stock ahead of the IPO, pledging to hold on to the shares for a few months. When state-owned Postal Savings Bank of China Co. raised $7.4 billion in its IPO in September, 80% of the shares were preordered by six other, mostly state-owned firms.
The presence of cornerstone investors makes it easier for companies to launch their IPOs. But critics say such deals are diluting the quality of the Hong Kong market.
""Hong Kong has essentially become a China growth derivative,"" says Kinger Lau, chief China strategist at Goldman Sachs.
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 636 of 1177
China is also changing the way Hong Kong stocks are traded.
The advent of the Stock Connect trading links between Hong Kong and the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets on the mainland in recent years has allowed mainland investors to buy shares of Hong Kong-listed securities via the link. Foreigners, in turn, can buy shares in China more freely than before.
While many predicted a rush of foreign money into Chinese stocks when the links were launched, so-called southbound trading, or money coming from mainland China, has become a vital source of inflows into Hong Kong. Trading volume measured by southbound net buying via the Shanghai Connect link made up almost 10% of Hong Kong's overall market in June, according to Jefferies, near its high since the program launched 21?2 years ago.
In turn, mainland traders are influencing which sort of stocks outperform in Hong Kong, analysts say. Mainlanders often buy into big Chinese companies with listings in Hong Kong, such as state-owned banks.
""The composition of Hong Kong's market is only becoming much more China-driven and China-exposed,"" says Ben Luk, global macro strategist at State Street Global Markets.

HSBC,Financial Institutions Lead Gains in Stock Markets; Shares of banking giant HSBC surge 3.9% in Hong Kong; Standard Chartered rises 3.2%," Jun 29, 2017",1,"Equity markets in Asia were higher Thursday, with finance stocks broadly leading gains after all major U.S. financial institutions received approval from the Federal Reserve to ramp up dividend payouts and share buybacks. This is the first time since the annual tests began after the 2008 financial crisis that all firms got passing grades, a sign, analysts say, of resilience in big banks and the U.S. financial system.
It paves the way for U.S. banks to increase dividend payouts and share buybacks to their highest levels in years, providing investors with confidence to invest in high-growth assets like technology stocks.
Australia's S&P/ASX 200, coming off its best day in two weeks, was up 1.1%, with large banks among the big gainers: Macquarie Group and Westpac rose 2.1%; National Australia Bank, 2%.
Big banks boosted Hong Kong shares as well, helping the Hang Seng Index to a 0.9% gain at the midday break. HSBC surged 3.9% to a 22-month high after a 20% price-target upgrade by Morgan Stanley, in anticipation of the lender's plans for its excess capital. Standard Chartered was up 3.2%.
Overnight gains in U.S. technology shares were also lifting shares of their key Asian counterparts on Thursday.

Korea's Samsung Electronics rose 1.1%, SoftBank Group gained 1% in Tokyo and Hong Kong index heavyweight Tencent rose 0.7%.
In China, share gains were more modest, with brokers pointing to reduced liquidity, following the sixth consecutive session that the People's Bank of China has stopped liquidity injections to the market. The Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.3% in the morning session.
Crude-oil prices rose despite an increase in U.S. stockpiles. The front-month futures for Brent crude, the international benchmark, gained 0.3% in Asia.
""You know you are back in a market with a bullish bent when [U.S. oil-inventory data] is ignored,"" said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at AxiTrader.
Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was up 0.5% despite giving up some early gains on a stronger yen. The dollar was down 0.1% at Yen 112.26, tracing back on early gains.
The U.S. dollar broadly extended earlier declines in morning Asian trade, with the euro and the pound gaining 0.2% against it. Overnight, the dollar pulled back in New York action, sending the WSJ Dollar Index a broad gauge of the currency's value to its second-lowest level of the year.
The dollar's decline comes as central bankers from Europe, the U.K. and Canada hint that they are moving closer to withdrawing their massive stimulus programs . Analysts said there was also speculation that weak U.S. inflation would stay the Fed's hands in raising rates.
""The markets are inclined to believe that the Fed is likely to be on hold,"" said Sean Callow, a senior strategist at Westpac in Sydney.
While comments from the central banks indicated improving economic conditions and a global pickup in demand, it would take them some time to actually raise real rates, said Colin Graham, chief investment officer of multiasset solutions at BNP Paribas Asset Management.
For now, ""central banks may be seeking to reduce the leverage in the market,"" said Mr. Graham.

HSBC,Inside the Push to Reclaim a Texas School's Gold Stash; The state is building its own depository and it wants a university and other investors to bring their gold home," Jun 30, 2017",1,"The University of Texas owns roughly $861 million in gold bullions locked in a bank vault in Manhattan. Now, Texas wants to bring that gold home.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 640 of 1177
The state is moving ahead with plans to create its own depository--the first state-regulated gold vault in the nation- -in the hopes of persuading the university and other investors to keep their gold in the Lone Star State.
The depository has cleared years of political hurdles, and now must overcome a regulatory challenge to bring UT's gold to Texas.
The University of Texas said it would consider moving its gold under certain conditions, though negotiations with the state haven't started yet.
That hasn't stopped Texas from pressing forward. This month Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar announced the state tapped Lone Star Tangible Assets, which stores and trades precious metals, to build and operate a bullion depository in Austin.
Mr. Hegar said the depository would serve as an alternative stash for gold and other precious metals in place of federally regulated banks or smaller, unregulated storage facilities.
Gov. Greg Abbott, who signed a 2015 bill to create the depository, and others have called for the ""repatriation"" of Texas gold.
Mr. Hegar said the state has bigger plans beyond claiming UT's gold.
State officials say they also envision expanding the depository into a commodities exchange for natural resources such as oil and natural gas, potentially challenging the existing commodities marketplaces in Chicago and New York City.
""Once the depository is up and running and people see how easy it is to make transactions there, I think it's just a natural progression of things that we'll be working with other commodities as well,"" said Republican state Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, who wrote the 2015 bill.
Construction on the Texas Bullion Depository is scheduled to start this September, a Lone Star spokesman said. The depository is slated to open in December 2018.
The security at the facility--which dubs itself ""The Fort Knox of Texas""--will be up to par with ""military installation,"" Lone Star Chairman Matthew Ferris said.
Mr. Capriglione first proposed a depository run entirely by the state in 2013.
That bill came with a hefty price tag for the state--$27.6 million over five years--and didn't pass. Mr. Capriglione tried again in 2015, this time proposing a public-private partnership in which a private entity would own and operate the facility under oversight from the state.
Under the 2015 law, the Texas Bullion Depository would function as a state agency contracted with Lone Star to build and run the vault facility.
Lone Star would get 90% of the revenue from fees, and the state would receive 10%, which would be used to offset administrative costs, a state spokeswoman said.

Motivated by the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Capriglione said he is calling for Texas' ""independence and sovereignty"" from Wall Street banks and the Federal Reserve, but isn't advocating a complete break.
""I don't think that we should blow away with the existing system, but there's nothing wrong with having a plan B,"" Mr. Capriglione said. ""That's what our depository does.""
For years, Texas Republicans have championed a currency system backed by gold and other precious metals. In its 2016 platform, the Republican Party of Texas called for a return to ""precious metal standard for the United States dollar"" and abolishing the Federal Reserve.
A spokeswoman for the University of Texas said the school will ""seriously consider"" moving the gold from its HSBC vault to the new depository in Texas if the state meets two conditions.
First, the depository would have to be a member of the Comex commodities exchange, which requires member institutions to be within 150-mile radius of New York City for inspection.
Mr. Ferris said Lone Star is in talks with a number of ""third-party banks"" to provide liquidity for assets in the depository, which would exempt it from the geographical requirement.
Second, cost of storing the gold in Texas would have to be less than what UT currently pays to HSBC Holdings PLC. The school pays $606,000 a year to store the gold in New York, the university said.
HSBC declined to say how much it charges for storage, and wouldn't disclose whether UT is a client. A spokeswoman for the bank said it doesn't reveal its clients.
Lone Star said storage fees for over $50 million is ""negotiable"" and no more than 0.15% of the asset value a year. Mr. Capriglione didn't specify what the Texas depository would charge UT, but said the depository would ""absolutely"" meet UT's needs.
""That gold belongs in Texas. Period,"" Mr. Capriglione said. Credit: By Covey E. Son"
HSBC,HSBC Wins Approval to Operate Majority-Owned Joint Venture in China; HSBC becomes the first foreign bank granted such a setup in the country," Jun 30, 2017",0,"

The joint venture with Qianhai Financial Holdings Co. Ltd., a state-owned financial company, will be called HSBC Qianhai Securities Limited and will be based in Shenzhen, HSBC said Friday. The U.K. lender had been waiting since November 2015, when it announced plans for the joint venture , for approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission.
The joint venture will conduct stock research, underwriting of stocks and bonds and advising on domestic and outbound mergers and acquisitions, HSBC said, and is expected to launch by the end of the year.
Foreign banks generally aren't allowed to have majority control of their joint-venture businesses with local brokerage firms in China. They are capped at 49% of such ownership and most are restricted from trading domestic securities. Banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., have clamored for years to get control of the businesses, hoping to reap more of the profits and be able to make more decisions on a local level.
Beijing has signaled it is open to gradually allowing investment firms to have greater stakes, but so far the cap has remained in place. HSBC was able to secure a majority stake under an arrangement between Hong Kong and mainland China designed to encourage trade and economic cooperation.
Under that arrangement, Hong Kong-funded financial institutions such as HSBC that satisfy various criteria are allowed to set up one such company each in Shanghai, Guangdong Province and Shenzhen. The Hong Kong- funded financial institutions can own up to 51% of the joint venture.
HSBC has been deploying capital to fund growth in the Pearl River Delta, an area of southern China adjacent to Hong Kong.
Separately, Bank of East Asia Ltd. also said Friday it had received approval to operate its own joint-venture, East Asia Qianhai Securities Company Limited. Bank of East Asia will have a 49% stake in the company, which will also be based in Shenzhen.

HSBC,"Hong Kong-Mainland China Bond Link Gets Off to Quiet Start; After fanfare of opening ceremony, Chinese bond prices were mostly steady in the morning session"," Jul 3, 2017",1,"SHANGHAI--China's bond market showed little reaction as Beijing and Hong Kong opened a trading link giving global investors additional access to the world's third-largest debt market.

year's landmark opening of the bond market to global investors with trading accounts inside China, and is modeled in part on the stock-market links between Hong Kong and Chinese exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
Unlike the stock-market links, the bond-trading connection is one-way: Foreigners can buy bonds in the mainland market, but Chinese investors can't do likewise in Hong Kong. China has been fighting to stem capital outflows and reduce downward pressure on its currency.
Few expect a huge rush of foreign money into Chinese bonds as a result of the new trading link, given that investors can already buy bonds in China. Chinese bonds aren't yet included in major bond indexes, so the many investment funds that track those indexes don't have to enter the market. And analysts say concerns about frequent bouts of volatility and the reliability of local credit ratings could keep investors away.
""The bond connect will at best serve to improve investor sentiment now, but given the less-than-convenient arrangements regarding clearing and so on, its positive impact will only become material in the medium to long run,"" said Tang Yue, an analyst at Industrial Securities. Market participants say that in addition to the paperwork, there are also concerns about currency conversion and hedging to offset exchange-rate risks.
Asked at the opening ceremony whether Beijing will make the link two-way, the deputy governor of China's central bank, Pan Gongsheng, said ""not at the moment."" He said it would depend on the amount of trading activity and initial demand from the market.
To showcase the new trading link, one of China's biggest banks, Agricultural Development Bank of China, on Monday issued 15 billion yuan worth of bonds that will be available to both domestic and global investors. China Development Bank will follow with 20 billion yuan worth of bonds Tuesday.
International banks including Citigroup and HSBC said Monday they had concluded their first deals as market makers for trading via Bond Connect.
Chinese bond investors are preoccupied less with the link than with what the People's Bank of China will do next in the money market and how the economy will perform in the coming months, said the Shanghai trader.
After injecting a large amount of funds into the financial system in mid-June to meet a seasonal surge of cash demand, the PBOC hasn't used its money-market liquidity operation during the past seven business days. The inaction is widely interpreted as a signal from policy makers in Beijing that they wish to continue their campaign to reduce debt and leverage in China's financial markets.
Foreign investors' share of China's interbank bond market remains low. At the end of March, the total amount of Chinese domestic bonds they held was around 830 billion yuan ($122.42 billion), or around 1.4% of the market, according to Goldman Sachs.
""Foreign money accounts for very little in our market, and it won't change much just because of the Bond Connect,"" the Shanghai trader said. ""The local players will continue with their own game.""

HSBC,"Canada, China, Israel and Russia Buck the Markets Trend--But Not in a Good Way; Stock-market indexes in those countries were the only prominent four to fall in the first half of this year"," Jul 3, 2017",0,"Stock markets around the world collectively had their best first half in years, but not everyone was a winner.
Just four prominent stock-market indexes fell through the first six months of the year. Benchmarks tracking Russia, China, Israel and Canada were the rare losers in an environment where nearly everything else rallied. In the past 20 years, there have only been four other instances in which such a small number of indexes started off the year in the red.
Analysts cite a confluence of reasons for why those four indexes declined, including exposure to falling oil prices and so-called mean reversion--the idea that a pullback in those markets was inevitable following sharp rallies in 2016.
Here's a look at the countries that are lagging and what could be in store for the rest of the year.
Russia
Russia's RTS Index sank 13% in the first half, the worst performer of the 30 indexes tracked by The Wall Street Journal. While the drop looks severe, it follows a 52% surge in 2016 and heightened volatility for much of the past decade.
The index lost four-fifths of its value peak to trough during the financial crisis. It then nearly recovered through 2011 before falling another 70% over the ensuing five years.
Oil prices are down 14% this year and in June entered a bear market . Oil's decline and the possibility of tighter sanctions on Russia have hit the country's stock market, whose heavy weightings include resource giants such as Rosneft Oil Co. and gas giant Gazprom PJSC.
""You've seen a 180 degree turn on sentiment around Russia,"" said Geoffrey Wong, head of global emerging markets and Asia-Pacific equities at UBS Asset Management. ""Any stabilization in oil prices should be good for equities going forward.""
Politics have played a part in diminishing Russian stocks' appeal, too, thanks to the continuing probes into Russia's alleged influence over the U.S. presidential election last year.
China
While most barometers of Chinese equities have done well this year, Shenzhen-listed stocks have lagged behind. The Shenzhen Composite Index dropped 3.6% in the first half, while its Shanghai counterpart rose 2.9%. And the MSCI China Index, which includes mostly Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong and the U.S., surged 24%. Shenzhen's weakness is a surprise. The market is home to many companies that should benefit as China's economy shifts to being driven more by consumer demand. Around a fifth of the market is made up of tech stocks, a sector that has enjoyed a stellar start to the year in other countries. Foreign investors late last year gained access to Shenzhen-listed stocks through a new trading link with Hong Kong , although demand from them has been underwhelming.
Still, Shenzhen-listed companies tend to be smaller and more volatile than those listed in Shanghai. Slowing economic growth and a crackdown on speculative investing driven by leverage could hurt Shenzhen-listed equities in the second half of the year, analysts warn.
Another consideration is valuation. The Shenzhen Composite Index trades at 25 times projected earnings over the next 12 months, compared with only 15 times for the Shanghai Composite Index, according to HSBC.
""Valuations make a big difference,"" said Grace Tam, senior market specialist at HSBC Global Asset Management. ""People are worried about Shenzhen stocks being too expensive.""
Meanwhile, indexes like the MSCI China have benefited from China's tech giants Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba

Israel is another market whose weighting toward tech stocks ought to have given it an advantage this year. But Tel Aviv's flagship TA-35 Index slipped 3.1% in the first half.
Still, three of the index's top five constituents are from the pharmaceuticals sector, which has struggled during the first half of the year.
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the world's biggest seller of low-price generic drugs and Tel Aviv's biggest listing by market cap, slumped 16%, hurt by an increasingly difficult pricing environment. The debt-laden company's chief executive stepped down in February.
Another generic-drug maker, Perrigo Co., slumped 9.3%, while shares in EpiPen maker Mylan NV, which has lost almost half its value over the past two years, were up slightly.
Canada
Oh, Canada.
The Toronto exchange's benchmark S&P TSX waffled between small gains and losses in the first half before finishing down 0.7%, with companies like Suncor Energy Inc. weighed down by falling oil prices.
Canada's robust housing market has also shown signs of strain. In April, Canadian authorities accused lender Home Capital Group Inc. of misleading investors about mortgage-application fraud. The company soon afterward tapped an emergency line of credit. Moody's Investors Service also downgraded the Canadian banking sector in May, citing high private-sector debt levels.
The S&P TSX gained 18% last year, so the index's slow start this year might also be a partial swing back from last year's rally.

HSBC,Hong Kong Faces Reinvention," Jul 3, 2017",1,"SEVEN IN A CITY KNOWN FOR ITS FRENETIC PACE, THE CHANGE since Britain handed Hong Kong back to China 20 years ago is remarkable. These days in downtown Hong Kong you're just as likely to hear Mandarin-China's national language-as you are Cantonese, the local lingua franca. Language isn't the only I a thing being subsumed by the motherland, either. In 1997, Hong I?ME? Kong accounted for more than 18% of the Chinese economy. Today, it's less than 3%, equal to neighboring cities Shenzhen and Guangzhou. Both of those were considered backwaters until a few years ago.
Hong Kong's stock benchmark, the Hang Seng Index, is a good barometer for how things have moved on. At the handover, most listings were local trading houses or those with links back to the United Kingdom, such as HSBC Holdings (ticker: 0005.Hong Kong) and Cathay Pacific Airways (0293.Hong Kong). Today, more than half of the index is made up of shares in mainland firms, like Petr°China (857.Hong Kong) and state-owned giant Bank of China (3988.Hong Kong). Unlike China, Hong Kong is a free market whose currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar,
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 656 of 1177
and its legal system is based on U.K. common law. This makes it attractive for Chinese companies to raise international capital.
This niche could be under threat. China has made big strides in opening its capital markets, which historically have been closed to foreign investors. Two Stock Connect platforms give unfettered access to stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen via Hong Kong, while an equivalent for bonds is in the works. Beijing is also gradually moving to internationalize China's currency, which isn't fully convertible.
That undercuts Hong Kong's big selling point. ""The old role of Hong Kong being the market through which foreigners invest in China will certainly diminish,"" says Eric Moffett, a T. Rowe Price portfolio manager. Nevertheless, he says, Hong Kong's legal system will retain its status as foreigners' preferred proxy for China for now.
In short, Hong Kong needs to reinvent its role. CLSA CEO Jonathan Slone, who has lived in Hong Kong for more than 30 years, says it offers an unparalleled platform for Chinese companies looking to go global. ""Sure, they can go to Goldman Sachs in Beijing, but they come to Hong Kong because it's where the mass of expertise resides,"" he says. The city retains greater allure for foreign talent than mainland cities like Shanghai and Beijing, which suffer from pollution and curbs on free speech. ""People want to live here because of the lifestyle, because it's exciting,"" he says.
Here's one way for investors to make money from the increasing convergence of Hong Kong and China. Many of China's biggest blue chips trade both in the mainland and offshore in Hong Kong, but frequently at wildly different valuations. Auto maker Great Wall Motor (2333.Hong Kong) trades at less than eight times earnings in Hong Kong, but at more than 12 times in Shanghai (601633.China). In an even starker case, China Southern Airlines' (1055.Hong Kong) H share is valued at 11 times trailing earnings, compared with 22 times for its A share (600029.China). As Hong Kong's and China's markets grow more interconnected, expect spreads to narrow, making cheaper H shares a compelling long-term play. ""As liquidity converges, this A/H-share gap in the long-term should converge, too,"" says Credit Suisse strategist Jack Siu.

HSBC,"Rising Interest Rates Raise Uncertainties for Hong Kong's Property Market; Housing prices in Hong Kong have risen to record levels, despite efforts to stem the tide"," Jul 4, 2017",1,"Rising interest rates may help to cool off prices in the world's least affordable housing market, something the government's administrative measures have had little success in doing.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 658 of 1177
Housing prices in Hong Kong have risen to record levels in recent months, defying efforts by the government to stem the tide of rising costs.
But rising interest rates, sparked by recent moves by the U.S. Federal Reserve, may succeed where taxes and other government dampening measures have failed. And some experts are warning that if this happens, it might not be pretty.
""Normalization of U.S. interest rates will eventually raise the mortgage burden of Hong Kong borrowers, posing risks"" to the city's export-driven economy and housing market, said Kevin Lam, HSBC's Greater China economist, in a research note.
In Hong Kong, home resale prices rose on average 21% in May from a year earlier, exceeding the previous peak recorded a month earlier, according to the latest data available from Hong Kong's Rating and Valuation Department.
The housing market has been mostly rising since the second half of 2016 after a small dip, as regulatory cooling measures seemed to only have a short-lived impact.
""Home prices have nearly tripled over the last decade and relative to incomes, are close to the highest on record,"" said Chang Liu, China economist at Capital Economics.
One of the newest residential projects put out for sale was Park Yoho Genova, where the asking price of a 721- square-foot apartment is HKD$10.4 million, or HKD$14,429 ($1,850) a square foot. The average sales price of a residential property transacted in Manhattan in the first quarter was $1,778 a square foot, according to a report from Douglas Elliman.
While these prices are comparable, housing is considered much less affordable in Hong Kong because incomes are so much lower. Indeed, for seven years Hong Kong has been ranked the least affordable city out of the 406 surveyed by Demographia, a think tank based in Belleville, Il.
Hong Kong's housing crisis is one of the biggest causes of resentment in the region 20 years after its handover to Chinese rule. Housing prices remain high due to the city's large population, land shortages, speculation and ample money supply.
Hong Kong also attracts demand from wealthy customers globally, and in recent years its housing prices have been driven up by an influx of newcomers from mainland China .
To head off damaging property bubbles, the government implemented property cooling measures intermittently since 2009, including stamp duties--which are essentially sales taxes--and curbs on bank lending. The latest attempt was in May--the Hong Kong Monetary Authority ordered banks to tighten credit assessments and cuts to the loan amounts banks can extend for properties.
But many experts predict these new measures will be as unsuccessful as similar efforts in the past. Buyers in Hong Kong already face some of the most prohibitive rules about home purchases, including a regulation from the central bank requiring home buyers to fork out a minimum down payment of at least 40%. Banks also have to set aside more money as reserves against bad loans.
Stamp duties have been raised to at least 15% to 30% for individuals and companies purchasing a residence, with some exceptions for permanent Hong Kong residents buying their first home.
But over the years such property cooling measures only had a short term effect. They haven't been as effective as those in Singapore or Canada because of a chronic mismatch between demand and supply and the exploitation of loopholes in these measures, analysts said.
For instance, cash-flushed property developers are helping customers skirt the central bank's minimum down payment measures by offering buyers credit so that they can make the down payment on new launches.
""The authorities are not that determined to crack down on the housing market because it is not in their interest to do so,"" said Professor Ngai-Ming Yip, an urban studies expert at City University of Hong Kong. He pointed out that land premiums and stamp duties from property transactions make up a significant portion of government revenues.
Hong Kong's real-estate market is affected by Federal Reserve policy because its currency is pegged to the U.S.

dollar. The Fed's loose monetary policy since 2008 has been one of the causes for the low mortgage rates in Hong Kong.
Lately the Fed has started to raise short-term rates and has laid the groundwork for shrinking its $4.5 trillion portfolio of bonds and other assets. Mortgage rates in Hong Kong have risen slightly in recent weeks after the authorities expanded risk management requirements for banks extending residential mortgages. But rates are generally still low compared with historical averages.
But if rates rise it could have a major impact on the city's housing market because many mortgages have floating rates. Prices also would likely fall because buyers would be facing higher borrowing costs.
The high prices are contributing to a housing shortage in this city of 7.3 million people that dwarfs comparable problems in other cities. Developers have been responding to the supply and demand imbalance by building tiny flats sometimes described as ""mosquito apartments .
Many residents live in homes the size of a parking space while people with lower incomes live in cage homes the size of a bunk bed. These have resulted in numerous photo essays online depicting their cramped conditions. The lack of affordable housing options also contributed to discontent that fueled the pro-democracy protests in 2014, where supporters carried yellow umbrellas and blocked streets for weeks.
""More and more Hong Kongers find it impossible to afford private housing, and are forced to join the queue for public ones,"" said Joshua Wong, a 20-year old pro-democracy activist, adding that the average wait time for a public housing unit is 4.6 years.
He expressed skepticism that no matter how many public housing flats are built, the root of the housing problem will remain if the government doesn't improve its long-term planning and change its favorable policies toward developers.
""The authoritarian rule together with the government's lack of empathy toward the society will only add fuel to the people's resentment,"" said Mr. Wong, who was arrested last week during a protest before the arrival of Chinese President Xi Jinping. He said he was released after 32 hours of detention.
The government has pledged to increase the supply of affordable housing. It has promised an additional 94,500 public housing units to be built the coming four years, a higher rate of production than previous years. The stock of public housing flats rose 74,000 between 2006-2016, according to data from Hong Kong Housing Authority. ""People have to buy smaller and smaller apartments in Hong Kong at higher and higher prices,"" said Vincent Cheung, deputy managing director, valuation and advisory services at Colliers International.

HSBC,U.K. Financial Regulator Urges Post-Brexit Free Trade; Andrew Bailey says regulators and authorities should not dictate where companies are based," Jul 6, 2017",1,"LONDON--The head of the U.K.'s financial regulator Thursday questioned whether financial firms need to relocate from the City to maintain access to the EU's financial markets.
Speaking in London, Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, defended free markets,
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 661 of 1177
saying regulators and authorities should not dictate where companies are based.
The comments from one of the U.K.'s top regulators mark a significant intervention in the debate on the City's future after Brexit . Big financial firms are drafting contingency plans for Britain's future outside the single market. Many have indicated they could move thousands of staff into the EU once Britain leaves, particularly if the U.K. is unable to secure a trading deal which keeps close ties to the bloc.
J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. initially plans to move between 500 and 1,000 jobs out of London , and bolster its operations in Dublin, Luxembourg and Frankfurt. UBS Group AG and HSBC PLC have indicated they are looking at options for around 1,000 of their London-based staff.
Mr. Bailey questioned whether financial companies required single-market access to have the benefits of free trade with the EU.
""When I hear people say that firms need to relocate to continue to benefit from access to EU financial markets, I start to seriously wonder,"" he said.
""Does Brexit have to mean abandoning the benefits of free trade and open markets in financial services? It should not. Does it require membership of the single market to get the benefits of free trade with the EU? No.""
There is ""ample evidence that open markets in financial services and free trade can exist safely without common detailed rules and shared regulatory institutions,"" he said.
Mr. Bailey also discussed the future for the U.K.'s lucrative clearing industry, which has been the subject of scrutiny since the Brexit vote. The EU's executive body has proposed plans that could compel clearinghouses that do a large amount of their business in euros to move into the bloc.
Mr. Bailey said cross-border regulatory cooperation, backed up by joint supervisory oversight is ""very clearly preferable to the cost and risk that is introduced by a location-based policy.""
Speaking at a separate event on Thursday, London Stock Exchange Chief Executive Xavier Rolet said that the EU has already struck deals with third countries for clearing and that any effort for the EU to cut off London would be ""punitively expensive.""
Mr. Bailey explained that the FCA is providing technical advice to support the government in Brexit negotiations, while working with regulated firms to understand their plans for the future. It is also conducting a line-by-line review of EU legislation and rule-making to create a regulatory framework that functions the day after Brexit. There would be no retreat from international engagement or cooperation with other regulators, he said.

HSBC,"France Moves to Lure Bankers to Paris After Brexit; Government pledges to cut taxes and labor costs, provide more international schools for expatriates' families"," Jul 7, 2017",1,"PARIS--The French government unveiled Friday new measures to attract bankers to Paris after Brexit, pledging to cut taxes and labor costs and provide more international schools for expatriates' families, as competition for London's jobs heats up.
French Prime Minister E?douard Philippe, at a Friday conference in Paris, said the government would scrap the highest bracket of its payroll tax, and cancel a planned extension of a tax on financial transactions. Some bonuses of traders and banking executives classified by the European Banking Authority as ""risk takers"" won't be included as a part of severance packages, he said.
""Our government's ambition is to reinforce France's attractiveness and competitiveness,"" said Mr. Philippe. ""Companies must want again to set up and develop their business here,"" he added.
Paris has stepped up its efforts to win business from financial firms currently based in the U.K. since the election of pro-business Emmanuel Macron as French president in May .
In addition to tax and labor-cost cuts, the government plans to open three international schools near La De?fense, the sprawling business district on the Western edge of Paris, and invest in an express train line from Paris's center to Charles de Gaulle Airport.
""This package of measures meets the expectations voiced over the last months by the financial institutions and international investors that we have met,"" said Ge?rard Mestrallet, the chairman of Paris Europlace, a group that promotes the French capital as a financial center.
French labor laws that make it hard to hire and fire workers have become a major hurdle for banks considering relocating business to Paris. Banks that pay hefty bonuses to lure traders and other talent don't want those sums later factored into severance payments, as is currently required under French law.
""The arrangement with bonuses is that you live by the sword and die by the sword...That's not the way the law plays it"" in France, said Ross McInnes, chairman of aerospace firm Safran SA, who has been lobbying companies to move to France.
So far, HSBC Holdings PLC has said it would transfer about 1,000 jobs to France, where it already has a retail presence.
""Senior executives from all the major U.S. and Swiss banks have met with French government officials and regulators in recent months,"" said Christian Noyer, former governor of the Bank of France, who was appointed last year by the French government to head a special envoy to defend the country's financial interests.
About 30 asset-management funds have also applied for a license in France, according French Asset Management Association AFG.
Paris, however, is facing fierce competition. Regulators and government officials across Europe are also trying to lure London finance companies ahead of Brexit . The sweeteners range from the promise of cheap rents to protection of bankers' bonuses.

HSBC,"Global Markets Higher, but China Bucks the Trend; Strong U.S. jobs report, gains in the dollar boost most Asia-Pacific markets"," Jul 9, 2017",0,"Equity markets were broadly higher in Asia on Monday, though Chinese stocks pulled back amid some concern about the pace of initial public offerings picking up.
Over the weekend, Chinese regulators cleared as many as nine IPOs, putting some pressure on local stocks as investor attention turns toward new issues.
The Shanghai Composite fell 0.4%, while the Shenzhen Composite, which generally has more new listings, fell 0.7%.
Meanwhile, Chinese inflation data released Monday were in line with expectations in June and unchanged from May.
""Having eased in previous months, price pressures appear to have stabilized in June,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics. ""Nonetheless, with slowing credit growth likely to weigh on economic activity in coming quarters we think that, volatility in food prices aside, inflation still has further to fall.""
Most other Asia-Pacific stock markets gained, led by Japan, Australia and Hong Kong, boosted by the strong U.S. jobs report Friday and subsequent gains in the dollar.
The Nikkei Stock Average finished morning trading up 0.7%, pushing back above the 20000 level after closing at its lowest level in three weeks on Friday. The yen softened Monday against the dollar, topping ¥114--a level not seen in two months--helping propel local exporter stocks.
Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.6% spurred by gains in bank stocks, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 1% after logging its worst week of 2017 by falling 1.6%. Index heavyweight HSBC rose 1.4%.
Elsewhere, benchmarks in Singapore and South Korea rose 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively.
The G-20 meeting made little impact on markets as global leaders displayed greater unity than expected.
Oil stocks, however, were lower following Friday's latest crude selloff--stoked by a rebound in the U.S. dollar, which recorded its best week of 2017, according to the WSJ Dollar Index.
Despite crude rising nearly 1% in Asian trading, oil companies' shares caught up with the end-of-week decline. Japan Petroleum Exploration fell 0.6%, Chinese oil major Cnooc was 0.7% lower in Hong Kong and Australia's Santos shed 1.9% to hit return to levels seen in early 2016.
A closely watched report released on Friday showed a rebound in U.S. oil-drilling activity. That is liable to weigh on prices in the near term, said ANZ Research.
Elsewhere--and after U.S. Treasury yields rose Friday--the Bank of Japan's end-of-week action kept domestic rates in check on Monday. The 10-year yield for Japanese government bonds was recently unchanged at 0.085%. Central banks are set to remain in focus this week, with Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen making semiannual testimony before congressional committees and the Bank of Canada widely expected to undertake its first rate increase in seven years.

HSBC,"Why the Euro's Surge Could Last; As the risk of a eurozone breakup fades, indicators suggest investors are increasingly positive about the currency's prospects"," Jul 12, 2017",1,"
Once dubbed a crisis currency, the euro has outperformed its peers against the dollar and investors are betting there are gains to come.
The euro is up 10% against the greenback so far this year, as the local economy rebounds and the threat from populist politicians calling for the currency zone's demise recedes.
With the risk of breakup fading, analysts are asking whether the currency can reclaim some of the global standing it held before 2009 and the sovereign debt crisis, not least as central banks place more of the currency into their reserves.
Multiple indicators suggest that investors are more positive about the euro than for many years and on Wednesday the currency traded at $1.149, its highest level in over a year.
""Political threats to the euro have definitely reduced its status, and from a historical perspective the rest of the world is underweight Europe,"" said Carl Hammer, head of global macro and foreign exchange research at Swedish bank SEB.
Three-month euro-dollar risk reversals, which measure the cost of hedging against drops in currencies, broke into positive territory at the end of June for the first time since at least 2010. A positive figure suggests investors are no longer asking to be paid a premium to hold euros, a sharp change from the recent past.
Investors also have a net long position in the euro--a bet that the currency will appreciate--for the first time in three years. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data shows investors held 77,464 more long than short contracts on the euro in the week to July 3.

The European Union has long hankered for a greater role in global markets. As far back as the 1960s, Vale?ry Giscard d'Estaing, France's then finance minister, complained of the U.S. dollar's ""exorbitant privilege"" as the pre- eminent reserve currency. Following its launch 18 years ago, the single currency reached a high of around $1.60 in 2008.
But the currency has lost ground even since the sovereign debt crisis ended in 2012.
Its share of daily turnover in foreign exchange markets has dropped from 39% in 2010 to 31% in 2016, according to the Bank for International Settlements.
The European Central Bank estimates that the share of international bonds denominated in euros has dropped from as high as 29.3% in 2004 to 22% at the end of last year.
In the first quarter of the year, slightly less than 20% of global official foreign exchange reserves were held in euros, according to the International Monetary Fund. At its peak in 2009, the euro's share of international reserves reached nearly 28%.
Aside from prestige, a greater international role would help eurozone companies raise funds while potentially reducing exchange rate volatility. The dollar's role as the most important global reserve currency has typically been seen as a boon for the U.S.
The lingering risk that the currency won't survive has reduced the euro's position in foreign currency reserves held by governments and central banks while putting off some investors.
""If you're a reserve manager, say in Asia, you would think twice about investing over the very long term in a currency that might not exist in five years,"" said Dhaval Joshi, chief European strategist at BCA Research.
That risk has abated recently. Elections in the Netherlands and France saw pro-EU candidates win convincingly, and support for Germany's main anti-euro party has dwindled.
Expectations that a country will leave the eurozone have fallen. Investors currently assign an 8.6% probability to a country exiting the eurozone in the next 12 months, against over 25% early in the year, according to the Sentix euro breakup index, which polls investors on their expectations for the bloc.
The brighter outlook for regional growth, which has recently outstripped the U.S., helps the euro on multiple fronts. It reduces the risk of breakup by helping to bolster the weaker southern European economies, whose debts and stagnant growth helped to fuel the sovereign debt crisis. It makes the region more attractive for outside investors. It also means the ECB will be quicker to jettison the bond-buying and negative interest rate policies that have capped the currency's gains. Such so-called quantitative easing, QE, policies keep bond yields low, reducing long- term returns for investors and stemming the flow of foreign exchange that would boost the euro.
It may even see other central banks stock up their reserves.
""It could be that the first quarter represents something close to the low in the euro's share of reserves,"" said Stephen Saywell, head of foreign exchange strategy at BNP Paribas.
To be sure, factors such as less monetary stimulus and a brighter economy could end up hurting the euro if the pace of both disappoint. The region's anti-euro politicians could also stage a comeback.
But the prospect of higher interest rates and other factors have already led many analysts to hike their forecasts for the euro in the short term.
Earlier this year Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley expected the euro to drop below parity with the dollar. Both have now raised their projections by 21 cents to $1.16 and $1.18 respectively. HSBC analysts who began the year with a $1.10 forecast now believe their current $1.20 projection may be a conservative estimate.
""Before Europe started the QE program we were comfortably above $1.20, so if that's going to be withdrawn, you've got to ask why the euro can't go much higher by this time next year,"" said Steve Jefferies, head of currencies and emerging markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa at J.P. Morgan.

HSBC,Behind Hong Kong's Stock-Market Surge: An Old Bank and a Millennial Tech Giant; Shares of HSBC and Tencent have pushed the Hang Seng Index to its highest level on an intraday basis in two years," Jul 13, 2017",1,"HONG KONG--One is a British bank founded in the 19th century colonial era. The other is a millennial Chinese technology giant barely two decades old. Together, they are driving Hong Kong's stock market to its highest level in two years.
A 20% rise in the shares of HSBC Holdings PLC this year and a 50% jump in Tencent Holdings Ltd.--the two biggest stocks by weighting in the benchmark Hang Seng Index--helped push it through the 26000 barrier Thursday to its highest level on an intraday basis since July 2015. The index's 1.2% rise added to a surge in global equities after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen overnight said the central bank is ready to adjust policy if the recent slowdown in inflation persists.
Other Asian markets benefited as well. South Korea's Kospi index jumped more than 1% Thursday after the Bank of Korea kept interest rates unchanged and raised its growth forecast. The Kospi has surged 19% this year to all-time highs despite the accelerating nuclear threat from North Korea.
And overall, the MSCI AC Asia ex-Japan index has risen steadily, up 23% this year. The index's worst pullback this year has been just 2%, the smallest intra-year decline in at least 30 years and far below the average pullback of 20% in a given year, according to J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
""I've been asking this same question since March about when we're going to get consolidation or a market correction [in Asia],"" said Tai Hui, chief market strategist Asia at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in Hong Kong. ""Just because we're overdue doesn't mean it has to happen.""
The irony, in Hong Kong at least, is the market's two main driving forces couldn't be more different. Tencent and HSBC have helped the index surge about 4% this week, on pace for its best weekly performance in a year.
Roughly half of the rise in banking giant HSBC's shares this year have come since the end of June. Major global banks with operations in the U.S. have performed strongly since then, after the Fed's annual stress tests gave most a clean bill of health, paving the way for more buybacks and dividends.
While the Fed doesn't have a say over HSBC's dividend policy, analysts say the bank might follow its U.S. peers by stepping up its shareholder-friendly payouts this year, on top of an already attractive 5.3% dividend yield. An expected rise in borrowing costs world-wide has also helped global banks including HSBC, as it should improve their profit margins.
HSBC was already one of the Hang Seng's biggest companies 20 years ago when China regained control of Hong Kong. Despite its British heritage, it is the only company that remains among the Hang Seng's top 10 largest stocks by market cap in the same form as it was in back then.
HSBC is today the largest company among Hong Kong-listed financials, which as an industry makes up 47% of the Hang Seng Index.

Meanwhile Tencent, which was founded in 1998, is now the world's largest videogame publisher by revenue. It also owns China's largest social network, WeChat, where people use it for everything from communicating with friends and family to ordering and paying for meals to booking vacations.
In nearly two decades, Tencent has already catapulted to become one of China's most valuable companies by market capitalization, flip-flopping with fellow tech giant, New York Stock Exchange-listed Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., for the top spot.
And Tencent's rally this year has made it the Hang Seng's biggest constituent, with about a 12% index weighting. Tencent has ridden the global surge in tech stocks this year, which has helped the likes of Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. also record strong gains. Its shares suffered a rare blip last week, when the company imposed a curfew and daily playing-time limits on children who play its top-grossing mobile game, Honor of Kings.
Analysts worry the new policies, which were implemented as a way to prevent gaming addiction, could hurt Tencent's overall revenue, of which 30% comes from mobile gaming. But the stock this week nearly recovered those losses, a sign that momentum is still in its favor.

HSBC,"India Hedge Funds Outpace Country's Hot Stock Market; They benefit by trading mainly in small-cap and midcap stocks, on a tear this year; benchmark tracks less-torrid large-caps"," Jul 13, 2017",0,"
Hedge funds investing in India are having their best year ever, outpacing those in other emerging markets and generating above-market returns, a feat eluding many of their global peers.
India-focused hedge funds were up 24% in the first half, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc., better than funds focused on any other single strategy or country. They also beat the 16% gain of India's benchmark S&P BSE Sensex index and 14% gain of the MSCI India index.
Globally, hedge funds are facing criticism for failing to justify the high fees they charge . They have gained an average 3.7% this year, well behind the S&P 500's total return of 9.3%, including dividends, Hedge Fund Research data show.
India-oriented hedge funds, which are mostly stock-focused, have outperformed mainly by trading in small-cap and midcap stocks, which have been on a tear this year. The benchmarks they are beating are dominated by large-cap companies like Infosys Ltd. and Tata Motors Ltd., whose performance has been relatively muted.
Some relative newcomers are gaining prominence. Take London-based Habrok India Fund, spun out of Habrok Capital Management's global hedge fund just over 18 months ago. It returned 24.5% through May 31, fourth-best among 473 global hedge funds ranked for clients by HSBC.
Habrok, which manages $50 million in assets and generated a 15% return last year, attributes these gains to bets on stocks in the consumer-discretionary, building-materials and insurance sectors--which it expects to benefit as economic reforms increase private wealth. The fund has a mandate to use leverage to fuel its market bets, and to

short-sell stocks, though like most India-focused hedge funds it has mostly pursued a ""long-only"" strategy.
""We think the country is going to transform over the next decade or two,"" said Rahul Khanna, the fund's London- based portfolio manager.
India's stock market has been among the world's fastest-rising this year, despite a bumpy ride for some measures Prime Minister Narendra Modi has introduced in recent months--notably withdrawing most of the country's currency from circulation last November.
A series of interest-rate cuts since 2015 has helped push India's growth rate past China's. The pace could hit 7.2% this year, the International Monetary Fund forecasts.
The optimistic outlook has drawn in foreign institutional investors, who plowed a net $8.4 billion into Indian stocks in the 12 months through July, according to data from the Securities and Exchange Board of India, as domestic Indian mutual funds funneled in a net $12.1 billion.
""Liquidity is just gushing in,"" said Andrew Holland, chief executive of Avendus Capital Public Markets Alternate Strategies LLP, one of a handful of India's onshore-based hedge funds. ""Interest rates have fallen and traditional real estate and gold as an option isn't really there, so you're getting more money in equities than before.""
Mr. Holland said large-cap information-technology and pharmaceutical stocks that have outperformed over the past decade might struggle to maintain their pace and justify their valuations. Others say small and midsize companies are better placed to capture changes in the types of products that consumers demand as India becomes richer.
India's domestic hedge-fund industry owes its existence to regulations issued in 2012. Before that, several funds set up offshore in places like Singapore and Mauritius, where they enjoyed favorable tax treatment, although the loopholes have recently been closed.
The universe of India-oriented hedge funds remains relatively small. Those with a mandate to invest in India alone total just 42 and manage $4.58 billion in assets, according to data from EurekaHedge. Contrast that with 156 funds and $26.94 billion for funds that invest in Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Some say Indian hedge funds' performance is still unconvincing. Their returns seem less exceptional set against those of the small-cap stocks they invest in, said Peter Laurelli, global head of research at eVestment, which collects data on the asset management industry. The MSCI India Small Cap Index gained 29% in the first half, slightly more than India-focused hedge funds.
Hedge funds invested in India don't consistently outperform wider benchmarks. HFR's index of India-focused hedge funds fell 0.1% last year, when the Sensex gained 2%, and gained 4.4% in 2015, short of the Sensex's 5%. Write to Gregor Stuart Hunter at gregor.hunter@wsj.com

HSBC,Michael Sandberg Dragged HSBC Into the Post-Colonial World; British banker created a base in the U.S. and built a futuristic headquarters," Jul 14, 2017",1,"After serving in the British Army, Michael Sandberg joined Hongkong &Shanghai Banking Corp. in 1948. Life East Asia at the time, he recalled later, was ""was like turning the clock back 50 years to an era of elegance and servants.""
By the time he became chairman of Hongkong Bank in 1977, he realized the future would look very different. He almost immediately began negotiating an agreement leading to Hongkong Bank's acquisition of Marine Midland Banks Inc. of New York, the first in a series of deals that created today's global HSBC Holdings PLC.
He embraced Li Ka-shing and other rising Chinese entrepreneurs who were starting to eclipse the British colonial companies that had dominated Hong Kong. He also spent about $670 million on a futuristic Hong Kong headquarters designed for the bank by Norman Foster.
Critics saw the bank headquarters, completed in the mid-1980s, as extravagant, but Mr. Sandberg said the bank needed a ""top-of-the-pops building,"" signaling confidence in Hong Kong as China prepared to regain sovereignty over the colony in 1997. The bank also provided him a mansion called Skyhigh in Hong Kong's Peak district. After retiring from Hongkong Bank in 1986, he served as Lord Sandberg in Britain's House of Lords.
He died July 2 in Hindhead, England. He was 90.
Michael Graham Ruddock Sandberg was born on May 31, 1927, in Thames Ditton, a village near London. His father worked at the Bank of England. Young Michael attended St. Edward's boarding school in Oxford. Dispensing with further education, he joined the Army near the end of World War II and was sent first to India, where he served as an officer in the Sixth Lancers, and later to Palestine and Libya, with the First King's Dragoon Guards. His regiment occasionally found time to hunt on horseback for jackals.
After returning to England, he found his homeland drab. In search of further adventure, he accepted a job at Hongkong Bank in 1948. The bank, founded in 1865 to finance trade with China, employed him briefly in London

before dispatching him to Asia. He had assignments in Japan and Singapore before returning to the head office in Hong Kong. During a vacation in Ireland, he met Carmel Donnelly. She turned down his first two proposals, but they were married in 1954.
Hongkong Bank was then so powerful in the colony that it was known simply as ""the bank."" It issued most of the Hong Kong dollars in circulation and owned stakes in a shipping company, an airline and a newspaper. Bank officers worked a 51?2 day week, ending at noon Saturday, when a cart was wheeled around to dispense pink gin and other refreshments.
Mr. Sandberg also served as chairman of the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club, the operator of a horse-racing track and luxurious refuge for the colony's Chinese and British elite. Though his schedule was packed with business and social engagements, he made it a priority to get home in time to watch the TV show ""Get Smart"" once a week with his children.
For all the comforts of expatriate life, Hong Kong was often an edgy place, lurching from property boom to bust depending on sentiment about developments in China. Mr. Sandberg wanted to create a ""three-legged stool,"" with substantial banking interests in North America and Europe to balance those in Asia. Marine Midland provided a U.S. base, though it suffered losses on loans related to commercial real estate and Latin America in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Hongkong Bank also bought a British stockbroker, James Capel &Co., in the mid-1980s but British regulators blocked Mr. Sandberg from acquiring Royal Bank of Scotland. After his retirement, HSBC bought Britain's Midland Bank PLC.
One blot on Mr. Sandberg's term as chairman was the bank's heavy lending to the Carrian group, a Hong Kong property company that collapsed amid allegations of fraud in 1983.
He stepped down in 1986, saying that nine years as chairman was ""about enough"" and that ""you go when you've got someone very good to take over."" His successor, William Purves, a Scotsman, was more cautious about frills and global expansion. The bank sold the Skyhigh mansion after Mr. Sandberg retired.
Mr. Sandberg's passions included watching cricket and horse racing. He owned race horses in Hong Kong and England and raised money for the Surrey County Cricket Club, operator of the Oval in London, one of Britain's hallowed athletic grounds, where he was a regular spectator in recent years.
He also collected antique pocket watches. ""Once bitten by the intricacies of the movement in some instances and by the sheer beauty in others, my enthusiasm for old timepieces became immense,"" he told The Wall Street Journal in 2001.
Mr. Sandberg is survived by his wife of 63 years, their four children, six grandchildren and a great granddaughter. Write to James R. Hagerty at bob.hagerty@wsj.com

HSBC,Greece Returns to International Bond Markets; Greece is seeking to swap a bond coming due in 2019 for a new one that will mature in 2022," Jul 24, 2017",0,"Corrections &Amplifications
A three-year bond issue in July 2014 raised [euro]1.5 billion. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the issue raised $1.5 billion. (July 24, 2017)
Greece said it would return to international bond markets for the first time in three years, seeking to swap a bond coming due in 2019 for a new one that will mature in 2022.
The country on Monday offered holders of a 2019 bond with a 4.75% coupon the potential option to cash in their securities; it will complete the deal if it gets enough demand for replacement bonds. It hasn't determined the price and terms for the replacements.
The deal is expected to close Tuesday.
Greece isn't expected to raise extra debt in the deal; the stretching out of maturities is meant as a show of confidence--and a way to deal with a big hump of debt repayments in 2019.
The 2019 bond has just over [euro]4 billion ($4.67 billion) outstanding, and bondholders who participate in the swap will have made a hefty return: Greece will pay [euro]102.60 per [euro]100 face value--close to the market price on Friday. A year ago, the bond was trading below [euro]90.
The banks mandated as joint lead managers are BNP Paribas, BofA Merrill Lynch, Citi, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and HSBC.
Athens has been shut out of international bond markets since 2010, except for a brief window in 2014. The move aims to build on the positive momentum created since the government concluded the bailout negotiations with its international creditors, recent upgrades by credit-rating firms and a rally in Greek bonds in recent weeks.
All told, Greece has about [euro]34 billion in outstanding euro-denominated bonds in private hands--a mere 10% of its total debt load.
The government is hoping that the swap, along with a few more similar moves before the end of its bailout, could mark the beginning of the end of eight years of economic and social upheaval
Greece's current bailout program ends in July 2018. After that, the country needs to be able to fund itself from the capital markets, or it would require another bailout to remain solvent. The European Union, including Germany, would like to bring to an end the bailouts that have caused great political friction for the currency bloc, according to EU officials.
Greece tapped the markets in 2014 with five-year and a three-year bond issues in April and July 2014. The first transaction exceeded expectations and the issue was seven times oversubscribed, raising [euro]3 billion at a yield of 4.95%, but the next sale just found enough buyers, raising [euro]1.5 billion. Later in 2014, Greece also persuaded some Treasury-bill holders to exchange their bills for the bonds.
Before its bailout era begun, Greece was last in the markets in April 2010, when it sold seven-year debt at a 6% yield. That issue was barely covered by investor demand, and within weeks Greece was forced to seek aid from its eurozone peers and the International Monetary Fund. It has since then agreed to three bailout programs.
Greece still has a giant volume of debt, though the lion's share of it is owed to its rescuers, doesn't come due for many years and sports a low interest rate.

HSBC,"Ryanair Willing to Pay to Keep Cash in Banks; CFO Neil Sorahan says airline will keep its cash pile in deposits, despite negative interest rates"," Jul 26, 2017",0,"Negative interest rates won't force Ryanair Holdings PLC to take money out of the bank.
Europe's biggest airline by passenger numbers had [euro]4.18 billion ($4.87 billion) in cash at the end of June. All of those funds are kept as bank deposits. The company eschews money-market funds and other financial vehicles because it wants quick protection against external shocks or flight disruptions, said finance chief Neil Sorahan. However, the Dublin-based airline will have to pay to store some of its cash in the coming six to 12 months, as European banks increasingly pass on the cost of negative interest rates to their clients.
Ryanair has been spared from paying for its deposits since the European Central Bank's introduction of negative rates in June 2014, but as interest income falls, banks are seeking ways to make up for the shortfall.
The European Central Bank left its monetary policy mix unchanged last Thursday. That means that negative interest rates--currently at -0.40 for overnight bank deposits--as well as the expanded asset-purchasing program, remain in place in the eurozone. Ryanair reports earnings in euros.
Nonetheless, Mr. Sorahan doesn't plan to pull the airline's money out of the 20 or more banks it uses.
""I want the cash to be liquid and for it to be in a safe place,"" he said. ""We have looked at everything else. Boring cash deposits still work.""
Ryanair's cash haul equates to approximately 62.3% of its fiscal 2017 revenue. As of March 30, revenue was [euro]6.64 billion. Profits for its first fiscal quarter of 2018 rose 55% to [euro]397 million.
In 2016, the company operated its aircraft at a per passenger unit cost of [euro]27--far lower than its competitors, Mr. Sorahan said.
The airline's longing for liquidity is by no means extraordinary, according to Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at HSBC Global Research.
""It is a desperately inefficient way to store cash but one that is very normal in the industry,"" he said. Airlines typically have 20% of their annual revenue available in cash, he added.
Ryanair has limited options. It announced a [euro]600 million share buyback at the end of May and is in the process of growing its fleet and looking to invest outside its core business.
Its strong position in the European short-haul market makes acquisitions challenging due to anti-competition concerns, Mr. Lobbenberg said.
Ryanair said on Monday it had made a non-binding bid for struggling Alitalia SpA.
The surplus cash means Ryanair doesn't have to provide additional collateral when ordering new planes, Mr. Sorahan said. Net debt is down to [euro]94 million and expected to fall further this year.
Competitors, including SAS AB and Air France-KLM SA, use revolving credit facilities to keep cash to hand. SAS had credit facilities totaling 4.9 billion Swedish krona ($597 million) in April, with SEK3.2 billion still available. Air France had [euro]1.76 billion in undrawn credit lines at the end of June.
SAS had 9.07 billion krona in cash and cash equivalents on hand as of April 30. Air France had net cash of [euro]4.46 billion at the end of March.
Ryanair would be in a strong position in the event of a ""hard"" Brexit, Mr. Sorahan said, as its cash pile would allow it to withstand revenue pressure from changes to the regulations that govern flights between the U.K. and other European Union countries.
""We are in a shock prone industry,"" he said.

HSBC,Chinese Billionaire Scales Down His Hollywood Dreams; Wang Jianlin's Dalian Wanda Group bought U.S. movie maker Legendary Entertainment for $3.5 billion last year--and now is scrapping some plans for an empire," Jul 27, 2017",1,"
BEIJING--Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin was on the verge last year of becoming the entertainment industry's newest mogul, snapping up prime media assets and setting his sights on a major Hollywood studio.
But that breakthrough now seems remote with the $13 billion sale of assets by Mr. Wang's majority-owned company Dalian Wanda Group to Sunac China Holdings Ltd.
Buried in the fine print of filings related to the asset sale is the disclosure that Mr. Wang is unloading his nascent sound-stage business, known as Wanda Studios. The 30 film and TV sound stages are part of the Qingdao Movie Metropolis entertainment complex Mr. Wang was building in the seaside city of Qingdao.
Once billed as a $7.4 billion project with production facilities, a studio tour, outdoor theme park, yacht club and hotels, the Qingdao Movie Metropolis was the focal point of Mr. Wang's fillmmaking ambitions.
In 2013, he flew Hollywood luminaries including Leonardo DiCaprio, Nicole Kidman and John Travolta to Qingdao for a red-carpet launch event and vowed to make China the global center of filmmaking.
Since then, however, the studio tour and theme park have been scrapped, plans for an international film festival intended to draw attention to the complex have stalled, and its original director has left.
Most of the Movie Metropolis sound stages are in use mainly by Chinese film and TV production crews lured by rich incentives of up to 40% off production costs, according to a producer currently shooting there. Under the terms of the sale to Sunac, Wanda will retain a 9% stake and a management role in them. Still, for Mr. Wang it marks the surrender of a prize.
A Sunac spokeswoman confirmed it would acquire the sound stages, identified as a ""television industry park"" in a regulatory filing related to the acquisition. Dalian Wanda Group declined to comment on the sale.
Wanda has shelved plans for further overseas acquisitions following a rebuke from the Chinese government for deals regulators view as overpriced and irrational . China has blocked state-owned banks from financing or refinancing six of Wanda's pending or completed acquisitions, with the approval of President Xi Jinping .
Dalian Wanda will ""respond to the state's call and has decided to keep its main investment within China,"" Chinese financial magazine Caixin quoted Mr. Wang as saying last week.
""Looking forward, these recent policy changes will certainly derail many of Wang Jianlin's ambitions vis-a-vis Hollywood, at least for the short term,"" said Michael Berry, a professor of contemporary Chinese culture at University of California, Los Angeles.
Mr. Wang was the talk of Hollywood last year after he bought U.S. entertainment company Legendary Entertainment for $3.5 billion. He entered talks to buy a 49% stake in Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Pictures unit and negotiated to acquire Golden Globes producer Dick Clark Productions for $1 billion. Legendary would help Wanda become ""the highest revenue-generating film business in the world,"" Mr. Wang predicted.
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 698 of 1177
But the prediction hasn't yet come true. Mr. Wang failed to merge Legendary with his other film businesses, and he didn't get the Paramount stake. Earlier this year, he couldn't close the Dick Clark deal, largely because of the Chinese government's tightening of capital outflows.
Regulatory filings related to the Legendary acquisition and a presentation on it that Dalian Wanda made to prospective investors offer a glimpse into a deal that caught the attention of Chinese regulators.
In January 2016, with the ink barely dry on its Legendary purchase, Dalian Wanda pursued an immediate follow-up transaction--seeking $1.5 billion in financing from investors in China to help take its movie businesses public, according to the investor presentation viewed by The Wall Street Journal.
Dalian Wanda planned to merge Legendary with its existing movie-production assets and list the combined entity-- called Wanda Pictures--on a Chinese stock exchange, according to the presentation. If the new entity failed to list within one year, Dalian Wanda promised to repay investors with 15% interest, according to the presentation.
To do the listing, Dalian Wanda intended to sell the combined movie-production assets to another one of its entertainment units, Wanda Film Holding Co., which was already listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange. Such transactions have become common in China with companies seeking higher asset values by tapping demand from retail investors, people familiar with the practice say.
Regulatory filings made by Wanda Film in May 2016 show Legendary's liabilities exceeded its assets in 2014 and 2015, and that it reported a net loss for both years.
Legendary said in a statement last week it is ""well capitalized with liquidity to fund its film and TV slates.""
The filings also show a net book value of $2 billion for the Wanda Pictures assets. Yet the Wanda Film unit would have paid $5.6 billion for them, based on their estimated future worth, according to the filings.
Such a lofty valuation would likely draw regulators' scrutiny, said Marshall Meyer, professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School who studies Chinese companies. ""If they see that the overvaluation is going to protect [a company's] own interests, they are going to put it on ice,"" he said.
Wanda Film suspended its planned merger of film assets in August 2016, citing a change in market conditions and ""an objective need to run [Legendary] independently for a period of time to prove the stability of its profit forecast,"" regulatory filings show.
Christopher Balding, a professor at the HSBC Business School in Shenzhen, said, ""Regulators sometimes are heavy-handed, but sometimes they can also smell when something stinks.""
While Chinese regulators never publicly rejected the transaction, they met with the country's big banks in June and told them Wanda is no longer allowed to inject overseas assets into its listed companies in China .
This month, Wanda Film said it would try to buy media assets again as part of a reorganization. Legendary won't be part of that transaction, people familiar with the matter said.

HSBC,"Meet Randal Quarles, Trump's Pick to Shake Up the Fed; The 59-year-old amateur pilot is expected to try to reduce the Fed's influence on banks"," Jul 28, 2017",1,"Randal Quarles became skeptical of government intervention during decades of work in the financial world. Now he is set to take the lead in shaping oversight at one of the greatest interveners of all: the Federal Reserve.
Mr. Quarles, President Donald Trump's first appointee to the central bank, is expected to be confirmed in the coming months for a four-year term as Fed vice chairman of supervision. That would make him the most influential U.S. financial regulator and give him a voice on monetary policy.
His de facto predecessor, former Fed governor Daniel Tarullo, engineered broad new curbs on risk-taking by the largest U.S. banks. Mr. Quarles, a 59-year-old amateur pilot and former government official who has made millions advising and investing in banks, has a record that suggests he will seek to reduce the Fed's influence on bankers' decisions, rather than expand it.
""Some refinements will undoubtedly be in order,"" Mr. Quarles told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, referring to the U.S. regulatory regime. ""The key question will be ensuring that...we do so while maintaining the robust resilience of the system to shocks.""
Mr. Quarles's approach may conflict with that of Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, who supported Mr. Tarullo's agenda. Her term as chair ends next February. Mr. Quarles has separately advocated that the Fed articulate a more rigid formula for setting monetary policy, an idea Ms. Yellen has criticized.
Friends and former colleagues said that if Mr. Quarles does try to change direction at the Fed, they expect him to move slowly and methodically, and to seek consensus. Cerebral with a wry wit, Mr. Quarles spent nights as a young lawyer at Davis Polk &Wardwell LLP, reading the firm's files on railroad reorganizations in the late 19th century.
""I had been interested in the history of that era,"" he explained in a 2010 paper .

Mr. Tarullo cracked the whip on the largest U.S. banks in part by employing the element of surprise. In ""stress tests"" and ""living wills"" examining how banks plan for the worst, he and other regulators ratcheted up their expectations over time and publicly rebuked bankers for perceived failings--scoldings that regulators said were necessary to clean up what they saw as woeful risk management.
Bankers have called for years for more predictability in the exams, in part to avoid further public thrashings.
On Thursday, Mr. Quarles said the Fed should publish more information about the stress tests. ""The benefits of the transparency outweigh any of the theoretical costs,"" he said.
Mr. Quarles also said he would review rules about banks' capital levels as well as the Volcker rule, which restricts banks from trading unless it is on customers' behalf. He avoided specifics. ""I don't have a view as to whether [capital requirements] should be higher or lower,"" he said.

During his career, Mr. Quarles has repeatedly criticized unpredictable policy-making. ""When governments have discretion, markets and citizens cannot be sure how the government will act, and that uncertainty results in inefficiency, delay and politicization,"" he wrote in the 2010 paper .
He said in 2015 that regulatory policy since the 2008 financial crisis ""tended to make the government a player"" in the financial sector when ""it should be a referee.""
At the same time, Mr. Quarles has separated himself from others who claim the ""free market"" mantle. At Treasury in the 2000s, he advocated for allowing foreign governments more wiggle room in dealing with bond investors--a policy opposed by some Wall Street money managers. He once called Timothy Geithner, President Barack Obama's first Treasury secretary and an architect of the 2008 bailouts, ""a very strong choice"" for the cabinet position.
Ravi Menon, a Singaporean official who engaged in last-minute talks with Mr. Quarles on a U.S.-Singapore trade deal, wrote in 2004 , ""Right from the start, we took a problem-solving approach aimed at finding middle ground rather than trying to convert each other on ideological arguments.""
Still, Mr. Quarles's background has raised concerns among Democrats. As a banking lawyer at Davis Polk in the 1990s, he helped banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. navigate regulatory limits to grow their securities businesses. He joined executives from J.P. Morgan and HSBC Holdings PLC at the Salzburg Global Seminar, held in the Austrian Alps at the hotel where ""The Sound of Music"" was filmed.
Later, as a partner at private-equity giant Carlyle Group, he lobbied successfully for regulators to let him and other big money managers pump money into troubled banks.
""The primary purpose of this job is to stand up to the largest financial institutions in this country,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) told Mr. Quarles Thursday. ""You have no history of having done that.""
Despite the Democrats' concerns, Republicans alone have the votes to confirm Mr. Quarles for the job, and none criticized him Thursday.
Mr. Quarles also has had financial ties to banks he could soon regulate. He married into Utah's Eccles family, which received a stake in Wells Fargo &Co. through the sale of a Utah bank in 2000 . His financial disclosure, signed in June, said he owns Wells Fargo stock valued at more than $1 million, and has exercised lines of credit of more than $1 million each from Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley.
In recent years, he helped manage the family's wealth at Cynosure Group, investing in financial companies including a Georgia bank , Brand Group Holdings Inc. Mr. Quarles has pledged to unwind his bank holdings and pay back the loans to meet conflict-of-interest rules.

HSBC,"Meet Randal Quarles, Trump's Pick to Shake Up the Fed; The 59-year-old amateur pilot is expected to try to reduce the Fed's influence on banks"," Jul 29, 2017",1,"Randal Quarles became skeptical of government intervention during decades of work in the financial world. Now he is set to take the lead in shaping oversight at one of the greatest interveners of all: the Federal Reserve.
Mr. Quarles, who would be President Donald Trump's first appointee to the central bank, is expected to be confirmed in coming months for a four-year term as Fed vice chairman for supervision. That would make him the most influential U.S. financial regulator and give him a voice on monetary policy.
His de facto predecessor, former Fed governor Daniel Tarullo, engineered broad new curbs on risk-taking by the largest U.S. banks. Mr. Quarles, a 59-year-old amateur pilot and former government official who has made millions advising and investing in banks, has a record that suggests he will seek to reduce the Fed's influence on bankers' decisions, rather than expand it.
""Some refinements will undoubtedly be in order,"" Mr. Quarles told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, referring to the U.S. regulatory regime. ""The key question will be ensuring that...we do so while maintaining the robust resilience of the system to shocks.""
Mr. Quarles's approach may conflict with that of Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, who supported Mr. Tarullo's agenda. Her term as chair ends in February. Mr. Quarles has separately advocated that the Fed articulate a more rigid formula for setting monetary policy, an idea Ms. Yellen has criticized.
Friends and former colleagues said that if Mr. Quarles does try to change direction at the Fed, they expect him to move slowly and methodically, and to seek consensus. Cerebral with a wry wit, Mr. Quarles spent nights as a young lawyer at Davis Polk &Wardwell LLP reading the firm's files on railroad reorganizations in the late 19th century.
""I had been interested in the history of that era,"" he explained in a 2010 paper .
When asked, ""How are you?"" he has a stock reply, former colleagues say: ""Better than average.""
Mr. Tarullo, who left the Fed in April, cracked the whip on the largest U.S. banks in part by employing the element of surprise. In ""stress tests"" and ""living wills"" examining how banks plan for the worst scenarios, he and other regulators ratcheted up their expectations over time and publicly rebuked bankers for perceived failings--scoldings that the regulators said were necessary to clean up what they saw as woeful risk management.

HSBC,"At Long Last, Europe's Banks Are Stabilizing; Several of the continent's biggest lenders post solid earnings, but problems remain"," Jul 30, 2017",0,"LONDON--After years of crisis Europe's banks are finally stabilizing.
On Friday, several of Europe's largest lenders reported solid if uninspiring results, a welcome change that shows the sector's grinding restructuring is starting to pay off.
Not long ago, investors fretted about whether European banks had enough capital to survive downturns and whether they would be able to level their mountains of bad loans. Many problems remain, but investors now have more-mundane worries, such as profitability and margins. European banks still badly lag behind their U.S. peers in profits and dividends.
On Friday, UBS Group AG and Credit Suisse Group AG posted better-than-expected profits ; both have thrown more effort into their wealth-management businesses. French bank BNP Paribas SA logged a decline in its second- quarter profit but still beat analysts' expectations. Barclays PLC posted a loss , but that came from charges linked to its retreat from Africa.
On Monday, HSBC Holdings PLC said it will buy back another $2 billion in shares and left the door open to return more cash to shareholders as strong returns in its business bolster its capital, in the latest sign of strength from the global banking giant.
""The capital question is now done,"" said Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley. ""Now the final thing is earnings."" European bank shares have shot up 50% over the past year as investors bet on lenders riding a European economic recovery and a lightening of regulations. European fund managers are still piling into the sector and see banks in the European Union as the most undervalued stocks, according to a survey this month by Bank of America. A newfound optimism has permeated once-gloomy bank boardrooms.
""I think European banks are at a turning point,"" Fre?de?ric Oude?a, CEO of France's Socie?te? Ge?ne?rale SA said recently. Now the test is whether European banks can live up to the hype. The main problem: Interest rates are still at rock- bottom levels. ""After a long, long deleveraging process we are entering into a phase where we can show some growth"" in Spanish loan volume, Santander CEO Jose? Antonio A?lvarez told analysts.
But with interest rates so low, it is hard to make significant profits on those loans. The benchmark rate that underpins most Spanish mortgage loans, on which rates typically float, is eventually expected to rise ""but nothing spectacular,"" Mr. A?lvarez said. Currently, it is still slipping.
In other countries, the pain could be prolonged because customers have locked in long-term, low-interest loans; even if rates do go up it could take time for banks to see profits. In Germany, for example, 85% of mortgages are fixed rate, according to Deutsche Bank.
To counter this, lenders have been slashing costs and shutting businesses. In Italy alone, banks are planning to cut at least 17,500 jobs this year, according to a trade union. Barclays has cut 60,000 people from its payroll over the past year.
Banks have also moved away from making loans to selling products not linked to interest rates, such as insurance or investment advice.
The number of big European banks with noninterest revenue accounting for over 40% of their operating income rose to 54 from 49 in the past year, according to the European Central Bank. Spanish banks CaixaBank SA and Banco de Sabadell SA beat analysts' forecasts on Friday as higher fees helped boost profit. The sudden jump in bank fee income since the start of the year ""was like someone flipped a switch,"" said Kinner Lakhani, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.
European banks moved at a glacial pace to restructure aft er the financial crisis but have acted more rapidly over the past year. A handful of teetering banks in Italy and Spain have been wound down, merged or bailed out. In June, Spain's struggling Banco Popular Espan?ol SA was rescued and sold to Santander. Earlier this month, the
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 709 of 1177
Italian government took control of long-troubled Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA. Meanwhile, big lenders have tapped shareholders to fund extensive restructuring. UniCredit SpA, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse raised a total of nearly $30 billion of fresh equity from shareholders.
Some of the overhauls are starting to work. On Friday, Bank of Ireland PLC announced it will pay its first dividend since the country was mauled by the financial crisis. The once-limping Banco Comercial Portugue?s SA announced it is raising salaries to precrisis levels after an average 6% cut since 2014. Its CEO, Nuno Amado, said ""it is a sign of normalization for BCP, both internally and for the outside.""
This is feeding back into the European economy. Bank-lending volumes have been gradually recovering since early 2014. Small and medium-size businesses in the eurozone have said there is an increase in the availability of bank loans over the past six months, according to a recent survey by the ECB.
Still, hurdles remain. First, there are too many banks. ECB officials have repeatedly said that the sector needs to consolidate, but bank executives remain wary of doing deals. Second, [euro]1 trillion ($1.18 trillion) of bad loans continues to sit on balance sheets. While the amount of bad loans is starting to ease, clearing them could be a slow process, Italy's bad loans could take a decade to work through before coming in line with wider European levels, according to an analysis by Morgan Stanley. A crash in shipping lending continues to pinch German banks. A restructuring of Deutsche Bank is far from complete.
Tougher regulations could also be on the horizon. The ECB is reviewing how the banks model risk. In January, new accounting rules will start to be phased in that force European banks to cover for potential losses on loans in real time, which is expected to add billions to their loan provisions. The global Basel rules are still being hammered out, which could result in banks having to change how they calculate risk. European bank executives are in the dark over how onerous those changes will be.
""It could get worse before it gets better,"" said Filippo Alloatti, senior credit analyst at Herme?s Investment Management.

HSBC,HSBC Launches $2 Billion Share Buyback as Profit Rises; Banking giant leaves door open to returning more cash to shareholders," Jul 31, 2017",0,"LONDON--HSBC Holdings PLC said it would regularly buy back shares if it has extra capital, in the latest sign of strength from the global banking giant.
HSBC said Monday it will buy back another $2 billion in shares, adding to the $3.5 billion stock it repurchased since last year. The transaction announced Monday is part of a new pledge by the bank to regularly buy back shares if it can, in contrast to the earlier purchases that were specifically linked to capital it freed up by selling its large Brazilian unit.
Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver said HSBC will review potential buybacks every half year, and go ahead with them if it has surplus equity and nothing more attractive to invest in. The bank has been adding capital through profit, as well as by shrinking in some areas, and analysts had expected more cash returns. Factors helping the bank in recent quarters include lower bad loans and rising interest rates on an expanding deposit base. HSBC has also been freeing up capital from its defunct U.S. consumer lending business.
On Monday, the bank said net profit for the second quarter rose 57% to $3.87 billion from $2.47 billion in the same period a year earlier. Its profit before tax for the period rose 47% to $5.3 billion.
Mr. Gulliver in an interview said the bank is seeing the fruits of the strategy he laid out in June 2015, including getting more cross-unit business from its 38 million customers. Revenue that can be attributed to such cross- selling rose to $5.9 billion in the second half from $5 billion in the first half of 2016, he said.
Analysts covering banks such as HSBC, J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc. have sought proof that the universal banking model is suited for an industry hobbled by banking rules and capital charges since the financial crisis. HSBC says its global reach should be a magnet for companies looking to trade or invest overseas, and it can do anything from managing their cash to helping them tap capital markets, all supported by a strong retail brand and private bank. At the 2015 strategy day, Mr. Gulliver laid out an aim to get revenue growth in its international network above GDP, and said he tracks the estimated figure every two weeks.
""It's an obsession because we need to prove the logic of the network that comes from referrals going between the three global business,"" Mr. Gulliver said.
""Global banking and markets ought to be taking commercial clients to the high-yield bond market, and retail ought to be introducing high-end premier accounts to the private bank,"" he said.
Showing the strategy is working is crucial to Mr. Gulliver's legacy building at HSBC. The revamp he and Chairman Douglas Flint started in 2011 involved exiting dozens of businesses and swaths of the world, and marked a U-turn for HSBC after a stint of unbridled growth. Mr. Flint is leaving in September and will be replaced by Mark Tucker, former CEO of AIA Group Ltd. Mr. Gulliver has said he would leave next year after a new CEO is named.
For the first half, revenue fell 11% to $26.2 billion from $29.47 billion a year ago. The bank said after stripping out the bank's sold Brazil unit and other one-offs, revenue was up 3%, mainly from higher revenue on customer deposits. Net profit in the period was $7 billion, up 10% from $6.36 billion a year earlier.

HSBC,"Eurozone's Low Unemployment, Inflation Raise Questions for ECB; Unemployment rate at lowest since February 2009, but price rises remain anemic"," Jul 31, 2017",1,"The eurozone's unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level in more than eight years, but the annual rate of inflation is unchanged, new data showed Monday--highlighting the challenge at the heart of the European Central Bank's decision on dialing down its stimulus programs.
The European Union's statistics agency said the proportion of workers without jobs across the 19 countries that use the euro fell to 9.1% in June from 9.2% in May, reaching its lowest level since February 2009. But consumer prices were just 1.3% higher in July than a year earlier, as the rate of inflation was unchanged, at its lowest level in 2017.
According to textbooks, that combination of falling unemployment and soft inflation shouldn't be happening. Central bankers believe that as spare capacity--one element of which is unemployment--shrinks, wages and prices should rise more rapidly.
""The eurozone continues to create jobs at a very strong pace, which is helping support domestic consumption,""said Fabio Balboni, an economist at HSBC. ""Unfortunately, from an ECB perspective, the fall in unemployment is not translating yet into inflationary pressures.""
However, the ECB isn't alone in confronting this unemployment/inflation combination. Figures released Friday showed the U.S. economy accelerated in the three months to June, but inflation remained weak, leading some investors to doubt whether the Federal Reserve can muster another interest rate increase in 2017.
As eurozone economic growth has accelerated this year, the ECB has come under greater pressure from Germany to wind down its stimulus programs. Speaking earlier in July, ECB President Mario Draghi said inflation remained his key target and that there are few signs it is set to rise soon.
He acknowledged there had been ""profound changes"" in the relationship between unemployment and wages in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, but he believes the link still exists and will eventually lead to a rise in inflation.
""The conclusion we drew is that in the end, yes, we will go back to a relationship like we had before the crisis,"" he said .
The ECB believes the unemployment rate underestimates the degree to which eurozone businesses can increase output without pushing up wages, because many of the jobs created in recent years are part-time, with employees working fewer hours than they would like. Mr. Draghi has estimated that 18% of the eurozone's workforce is either unemployed or underemployed.
Another factor that may be holding back pay rises is that workers are basing their demands on the experience of recent years, which is of very modest price increases and in some periods, price declines.
Mr. Draghi has noted that some changes to labor laws that the central bank believes are desirable in the long run may be limiting wage increases.
Spain reformed its job markets in 2012 and has led job creation in the eurozone since the launch of the ECB's stimulus measures in mid-2014, accounting for two fifths of new positions. But jobs have been created in part because wages have risen more slowly than before, since a key element of the reform was to give businesses room to cut pay.
Given those uncertainties about the outlook for inflation, many ECB watchers expect policy makers to approach
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 714 of 1177
any removal of stimulus with caution, starting with a cut in monthly bond purchases from [euro]60 billion in January.
""We continue to see the ECB's withdrawal of its stimulus measures taking place only very gradually with tapered purchases extended into the middle of 2018 and rate rises very unlikely over the coming two years,"" said Cathal Kennedy, an economist at RBC Capital Markets.
There are some signs that stronger growth is starting to push prices higher. Eurostat said prices of manufactured goods rose more quickly in the 12 months to July. But that acceleration was slight, and prices of services slowed. Meanwhile, the euro's recent rise against the U.S. dollar could work against the ECB by lowering prices of imported goods, including energy.

HSBC,New York Stock Exchange Composite List," Jul 31, 2017",0,
HSBC,A New Day for Honeywell," Jul 31, 2017",1,"
The industrial giant's new CEO is likely to keep profits growing and shareholders smiling. A big bet on software DARIUS ADAMCZYK, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL'S LEADER since April, has a tough act to follow. Under predecessor David Cote, who served for 15 years, the industrial conglomerate averaged double-digit annual earnings gains, while its stock returned a total of 11% a year, about four percentage points ahead of the Standard
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 717 of 1177
&Poor's 500 index. But the odds are good that Adamczyk, 51, a Polish native and Harvard M.B.A., can keep the good times rolling.
The new CEO, who has led several Honeywell businesses, inherits a company with rich opportunities to grow, especially in software; to expand profit margins; and to generate more free cash. Even the dominant aerospace business, challenged in part by a weak business-jet market, looks poised to generate bigger profits.
If Adamczyk delivers as expected, Honeywell's revenue could rise 4% next year, and earnings, 10%, leading to a higher price/earnings ratio and a 15% total return for the shares.
Honeywell shares (ticker: HON) closed last week at $136.75 and trade for 17.6 times next year's expected earnings. Yield: 1.9%.
Based in Morris Plains, N.J., Honeywell has been selling variants of today's modern thermostat since 1885. The company has a sprawling product portfolio, including fire and security systems, cockpit instruments for airplanes, and chemicals used in oil refining.
Aerospace, the largest of four operating segments, contributes 37% of annual revenue and 40% of profit. Home and building technologies, which includes displays and controls for heating and ventilation, and the performance materials and technology unit, which sells chemicals, each generate roughly a fourth of revenue and profit. Honeywell's smallest unit, safety and product solutions, is home to Intelligrated, a warehouse-automation business acquired last year for $1.5 billion that strengthens the company's position in the growing e-commerce market. Analysts expect Honeywell to earn $5.5 billion, or $7.08 a share, this year, up 7% from last year's $6.60 a share, on a 1% revenue gain to $39.7 billion. Wall Street is estimating earnings of $7.75 a share for 2018.
In the second quarter, Honeywell's organic revenue, excluding acquisitions and currency translation, rose 3% year to year, the best quarterly showing since 2014. Earnings rose 14 cents, to $1.80 a share, boosted by strong results in aerospace and performance materials and technologies, or PMT. The latter unit has significant exposure to the longdepressed oil and gas market, which is beginning to rebound.
John Inch, of Deutsche Bank Markets Research, noted recently that ""PMT organic growth is positioned to significantly accelerate in 2018,"" due in part to strong orders. The unit's orders and backlog grew by double digits in the latest quarter compared with a year earlier. Inch raised his Honeywell stock-price target to $154, 13% above the stock's recent price, citing faster top-line and earnings growth than the market expects. His price target assumes the stock will command a multiple of 19.5 times the $7.90 a share he expects the company to earn next year.
Honeywell's second-quarter profit margin, by segment, expanded to 19% from 18.5% a year earlier. Still, some investors are concerned about the CEO transition, the issuance of lower sales guidance last fall, and sluggish revenue growth in recent years, especially in aerospace, where organic revenue declined 3% in 2016. It is stabilizing this year and expected to turn positive in 2018.
These worries have weighed on the stock, which trades at about a 5% discount to its peer-group average.
Critical to Honeywell's profit growth is its growing software business. ""Software is going to become a bigger differentiator,"" Adamczyk says. ""Whether it's from an industrial plant, an aircraft, a home, or a building, we're the data-collection piece. We're in a very advantageous spot, relative to our competition.""
HSBC Global Research estimates that the company's stand-alone software products will account for roughly 22% of total sales in 2020, more than double 2015's level.
""Higher software sales are going to lengthen the runway of margin expansion,"" says Jason Adams, an analyst at T. Rowe Price.
Alternately, aerospace has been a worry for investors. In late April, activist hedge fund firm Third Point took a position in Honeywell and called for the company to spin off its aerospace unit, arguing that such a transaction ""would result in a sustained increase in shareholder value in excess of $20 billion."" Honeywell has declined to comment on Third Point's request.
Adamczyk is reviewing the company's portfolio with an eye toward weeding out underperforming businesses. But don't bet on an aerospace spinoff. Honeywell has invested more than $18 billion in aerospace since 2010, and the
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 718 of 1177

unit has won a place on various aircraft platforms, including the planned Boeing 777X. Aerospace had the second- highest profit margin among the four operating groups in the latest quarter, at 22.3%. Deutsche Bank's Inch notes that incentives paid by the unit to aerospace equipment makers are likely to fall in the next two years as current product cycles age, adding $80 million to $100 million to profits.
Honeywell's capital investments, chiefly in aerospace and PMT, topped $1 billion last year. Capital spending could drop by some $200 million in the next few years, which could boost free cash flow. Free cash rose nearly 40% in the first six months of the year, to $2 billion. This should help Honeywell fund acquisitions, repurchase shares, and grow its dividends, all priorities that won't change under its new CEO.
Honeywell has raised its quarterly dividend regularly since 2011, most recently by 12% in October, to 66.5 cents a share. In the first half of 2017, the company repurchased just under $1 billion of stock, and it has about $3 billion remaining on its current buyback authorization.
A smart growth strategy and shareholder-friendly initiatives bode well for Adamczyk's tenure, and investors. ? Sidebar
The Bottom Line

HSBC,Preferred Stock Listings," Jul 31, 2017",0,"LONDON--After years of crisis Europe's banks are finally stabilizing.
This earnings season, several of Europe's largest lenders reported solid if uninspiring results, a welcome change that shows the sector's grinding restructuring is starting to pay off.
Not long ago, investors fretted about whether European banks had enough capital to survive downturns and whether they would be able to level their mountains of bad loans. Many problems remain, but investors now have more-mundane worries, such as profitability and margins. European banks still badly lag behind their U.S. peers in profits and dividends.
On Monday, HSBC Holdings PLC said it would buy back another $2 billion in shares and left the door open to return more cash to shareholders as strong returns in its business bolster its capital, in the latest sign of strength from the global banking giant.
Last week, UBS Group AG and Credit Suisse Group AG posted better-than-expected profits ; both have thrown more effort into their wealth-management businesses. French bank BNP Paribas SA logged a decline in its second- quarter profit but still beat analysts' expectations. Barclays PLC posted a loss , but that came from charges linked to its retreat from Africa.
""The capital question is now done,"" said Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley. ""Now the final thing is earnings."" European bank shares have shot up 50% over the past year as investors bet on lenders riding a European economic recovery and a lightening of regulations. European fund managers are still piling into the sector and see banks in the European Union as the most undervalued stocks, according to a survey this month by Bank of America. A newfound optimism has permeated once-gloomy bank boardrooms.
""I think European banks are at a turning point,"" Fre?de?ric Oude?a, CEO of France's Socie?te? Ge?ne?rale SA said recently. Now the test is whether European banks can live up to the hype. The main problem: Interest rates are still at rock- bottom levels. ""After a long, long deleveraging process we are entering into a phase where we can show some growth"" in Spanish loan volume, Santander CEO Jose? Antonio A?lvarez told analysts.
But with interest rates so low, it is hard to make significant profits on those loans. The benchmark rate that underpins most Spanish mortgage loans, on which rates typically float, is eventually expected to rise ""but nothing spectacular,"" Mr. A?lvarez said. Currently, it is still slipping.
In other countries, the pain could be prolonged because customers have locked in long-term, low-interest loans; even if rates do go up it could take time for banks to see profits. In Germany, for example, 85% of mortgages are fixed rate, according to Deutsche Bank.
To counter this, lenders have been slashing costs and shutting businesses. In Italy alone, banks are planning to cut at least 17,500 jobs this year, according to a trade union. Barclays has cut 60,000 people from its payroll over the past year.
Banks have also moved away from making loans to selling products not linked to interest rates, such as insurance or investment advice.
The number of big European banks with noninterest revenue accounting for over 40% of their operating income rose to 54 from 49 in the past year, according to the European Central Bank. Spanish banks CaixaBank SA and Banco de Sabadell SA beat analysts' forecasts on Friday as higher fees helped boost profit. The sudden jump in bank fee income since the start of the year ""was like someone flipped a switch,"" said Kinner Lakhani, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.

European banks moved at a glacial pace to restructure aft er the financial crisis but have acted more rapidly over the past year. A handful of teetering banks in Italy and Spain have been wound down, merged or bailed out. In June, Spain's struggling Banco Popular Espan?ol SA was rescued and sold to Santander. Earlier this month, the Italian government took control of long-troubled Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA. Meanwhile, big lenders have tapped shareholders to fund extensive restructuring. UniCredit SpA, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse raised a total of nearly $30 billion of fresh equity from shareholders.
Some of the overhauls are starting to work. On Friday, Bank of Ireland PLC announced it will pay its first dividend since the country was mauled by the financial crisis. The once-limping Banco Comercial Portugue?s SA announced it is raising salaries to precrisis levels after an average 6% cut since 2014. Its CEO, Nuno Amado, said ""it is a sign of normalization for BCP, both internally and for the outside.""
This is feeding back into the European economy. Bank-lending volumes have been gradually recovering since early 2014. Small and medium-size businesses in the eurozone have said there is an increase in the availability of bank loans over the past six months, according to a recent survey by the ECB.
Still, hurdles remain. First, there are too many banks. ECB officials have repeatedly said that the sector needs to consolidate, but bank executives remain wary of doing deals. Second, [euro]1 trillion ($1.18 trillion) of bad loans continues to sit on balance sheets. While the amount of bad loans is starting to ease, clearing them could be a slow process, Italy's bad loans could take a decade to work through before coming in line with wider European levels, according to an analysis by Morgan Stanley. A crash in shipping lending continues to pinch German banks. A restructuring of Deutsche Bank is far from complete.
Tougher regulations could also be on the horizon. The ECB is reviewing how the banks model risk. In January, new accounting rules will start to be phased in that force European banks to cover for potential losses on loans in real time, which is expected to add billions to their loan provisions. The global Basel rules are still being hammered out, which could result in banks having to change how they calculate risk. European bank executives are in the dark over how onerous those changes will be.
""It could get worse before it gets better,"" said Filippo Alloatti, senior credit analyst at Herme?s Investment Management.

HSBC,"HSBC Is a Cash Machine With Plenty Left to Give; HSBC promised a new slug of buybacks, and there could be more where that comes from"," Jul 31, 2017",0,"
LONDON--HSBC's departing leaders are enjoying their victory laps and investors are finally cheering them on. The bank announced another $2 billion of stock buybacks on Monday on the back of better first-half profit and higher capital. That adds to the $3.5 billion of buybacks since last year, when both Douglas Flint, chairman, and Stuart Gulliver, chief executive, announced their pending retirements.
Investors have become more convinced of HSBC's payout potential : its dividend yield has come down dramatically from over 7% most of last year to about 5.2% now. But that still leaves the stock with room to do better as its yield remains more than double that of U.S. and European rivals.
Return on equity, at 8.8% annualized in the first half, is still behind a target of more than 10%. But if U.S. interest rates continue to rise, that should lift revenue from HSBC's huge deposits of U.S. and Hong Kong dollars and push the bank toward its goal.
And while that may be a slow-burn, investors will keep getting rewards from management's balance-sheet restructuring and cost-cutting over the past two years. These efforts will allow a stream of further stock buybacks in the next few years.
Between 2017 and 2019, HSBC could buy back up to $4 billion in stock a year, according to recent estimates from Morgan Stanley. That would be on top of more than $10 billion a year in dividends assuming the bank sticks to its recent habit of paying 51 cents-a-share annually.
Even then there might still be money left over. HSBC's investors usually take 20% to 30% of dividends in the form of new shares, which lowers the cash cost of paying them and means the group retains more capital. With this and current levels of profitability, the bank might end up with an extra $1 billion a year of excess capital.
Mr. Gulliver pointed to a handful of things that may eat up capital. There are coming changes to global bank capital rules, which could increase HSBC's capital requirements. However expectations are that these won't start to take effect until after 2021 and won't be fully implemented until 2026.
There is also the potential cost of new international accounting rules, known as IFRS 9, which will increase loan- loss provisions for many banks. Big banks like HSBC with sophisticated capital models are expected to feel less pain from this than smaller banks, because the former's approach to credit provisions already does what the accounting change is meant to achieve.
The bank will want to keep some extra capital for unforeseeable political or economic risks, but even after the buyback announced Monday, HSBC has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 14.5% compared with its target of 12% to 13%.
The main challenge for incoming chairman, Mark Tucker, currently CEO of Hong Kong-based insurer, AIA, will be in finding a CEO who can help him use this inheritance wisely.

HSBC,"Brexit Could Lead to the Loss of 17,000 U.K. Investment Banking Jobs, Study Shows; Such a departure won't mortally wound the country's reputation as a financial hub but could reduce efficiencies"," Aug 1, 2017",1,"LONDON--Up to 17,000 investment banking jobs could leave the U.K. soon after Brexit, according to the latest estimates by consulting firm Oliver Wyman.
With the U.K. government negotiating an exit from the European Union, there is a chance that banks will lose their rights to sell products to EU clients. To offset this, banks are putting into place contingency plans to build out their operations in the trade bloc. Based on those initial plans, Oliver Wyman says 15,000 to 17,000 wholesale banking jobs are set to be relocated i nto the EU. Over the longer term, that number could rise to 40,000, the firm says. There are around 560,000 people employed in banking in the U.K, so such a departure is unlikely to mortally wound the country's reputation as a financial hub. But it could reduce the efficiencies of having Europe's investment banking services located in one place, the firm added.
""We find uncertainty about the outcome of the Brexit negotiations means wholesale banks are trying to restrict

their initial responses to 'no regrets' moves: actions that increase their options but cost relatively little, such as applying for licenses in EU jurisdictions,"" the group said in a report. However in the next six to 12 months banks will have to start making more expensive decisions, such as relocating staff. Already banks are warning about taking a Brexit hit. HSBC PLC Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver said on Monday that creating a new hub in Paris could cost up to $300 million.
The reorganization is likely to eat into banks' profits. Oliver Wyman estimates U.K. based investment banks would need to find $30 billion to $50 billion of extra capital to support new European entities, if the U.K. cuts all ties to the EU. That is equivalent to 15% to 30% of the capital currently parked in the region by investment banks. This could add up to a 4% increase in annual cost base, equivalent to around $1 billion across the industry.

HSBC,Why Trading in Japan's Government Bonds Is a Snooze; Trading volumes have fallen by nearly a quarter for the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond," Aug 1, 2017",1,"
TOKYO--The world's second-biggest government bond market is close to becoming inactive.
Trading in Japanese government bonds has plummeted this year, with volumes down by nearly a quarter for the benchmark 10-year note in the first six months of the year, according to data from Quick. Prices have barely budged meantime.
The culprit, according to many in the market: Japan's central bank.
Since 2013, the Bank of Japan has been buying up billions of dollars of Japanese government bonds, flooding the economy with cash in an effort to boost the country's stubbornly-low annual inflation rate toward its 2% target . The central bank now owns some 40% of the ¥1.1 trillion ($9.98 billion) of JGBs in issue.
Compounding its dominant ownership of the market, the BOJ has since September sought to keep the yield on 10- year Japanese government bonds at zero , meaning it buys 10-year JGBs if and when their yields rise. Bond yields rise when their prices fall. The ""yield curve control"" policy was designed to help increase the profits Japanese banks could earn from lending money.
The cumulative effect of the central bank's heavy hand in the market means investors are finding it hard to profit from trading government bonds: Price volatility has sunk to near-record lows this year.
On average, $900 million of 10-year Japanese government bonds were traded each day last month, according to Quick data. Direct comparison is tricky, but some $75 billion-$90 billion of U.S. Treasurys due in seven to 11 years change hands on average each day, according to data from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.
""It's a very tough and strange situation right now for the JGB market,"" said Kazuaki Oh'E, head of fixed income at CIBC World Markets Japan in Tokyo, adding that some traders have taken to playing catch or practicing minigolf in the office on days when there is hardly any trading.
""It is kind of a problem for investors that [the BOJ] killed the secondary market...It's very boring, it's a cold market,"" he said.
Government bond markets the world over are a vital cog in the financial system, and not just because of their vast size. Such bonds are seen as ""risk free"" in countries like the U.S. and Japan--that is, highly unlikely to suffer a
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 731 of 1177
default. The price and yield at which they trade are used as a benchmark against which other, riskier debt is valued. If a major market like the one for Japanese government bonds is distorted, it could lead to the mispricing of a range of assets across the economy.
The yield on 10-year JGBs is important as it ""plays a critical role as a risk-free benchmark for other financial instruments,"" said Masaki Okazaki, head of corporate planning at Tokyo-based brokerage Japan Bond Trading. When trading in JGBs fizzles out, ""we can't know whether the rate is appropriate or not,"" he said.
Low trading volumes carry other risks. Any miscommunication by Japan's central bank could suddenly roil sleepy markets, causing volatility to surge.
But bond traders might welcome some excitement. In a central-bank survey released in early June, 44 market participants were asked their view on the degree of bond-market functioning: 55% replied ""not very high"" while the remainder said ""low."" Only one survey respondent said their firm had increased the frequency of their bond dealing during the February-to-May period.
The BOJ's ""aggressive buying has sucked up all the oxygen and led to sharp decline in liquidity,"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at HSBC Holdings in Hong Kong.
Some of the BOJ's own board members have criticized the effect of its policies. Low market volatility ""has led to a decline in market functioning,"" according to one board member quoted in the minutes of the central bank's June policy meeting . ""It will remain unattractive to invest in JGBs if the yield and volatility continue to be this low for a prolonged period,"" another member said.
Even when global government bond markets experienced a sharp selloff in early July , the reaction in Japan was late and somewhat muted. The yield on the 10-year government bond rose to a five-month high at 0.105% on July 7, before the BOJ swiftly intervened to bring it back down closer to its 0% target.
Trading volumes in the Japanese government bond market have nose-dived before. After the BOJ in October 2014 increased its annual JGB-buying target to ¥80 trillion from ¥50 trillion, volumes also plummeted. Still, they recovered not long after. The problem this time around is that with bond yields capped, few investors see opportunities to trade profitably.
Most market watchers expect the BOJ to dominate the JGB market for some time, with the inflation target still some way off. Core inflation in Japan reached 0.4% in June.

HSBC,"A U.K. Fund Starts to Recover From Brexit; The iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF lost investors after last year's Brexit referendum, but money has flowed back in this year"," Aug 7, 2017",0,"The iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF (EWU) is enjoying renewed popularity. But much like the country it focuses on, it has encountered some turbulence over the past year or so, with the uncertainties surrounding the U.K.'s pending exit from the European Union weighing on investors.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 733 of 1177
EWU is a $2.82 billion market-weighted fund, comprising mainly large U.K. companies. Like the British economy, it tilts toward finance, energy and consumer staples, with HSBC Holdings PLC, British American Tobacco PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC among its top five holdings.
The fund had net inflows of about $575 million in the first seven months of this year, with a total return of 12.53% in that period. However, its performance since the Brexit referendum of June 23, 2016, hasn't always been as positive, says Tushar Yadava, an iShares investment strategist at BlackRock Inc., the issuer of iShares funds. The fall in the value of sterling in the wake of the referendum, he says, prompted investors to favor the currency-hedged version of EWU, the iShares Currency Hedged MSCI United Kingdom ETF (HEWU).
""People wanted to keep a U.K. exposure, but to take the sterling view out of it,"" Mr. Yadava says. Between the referendum and the end of last year, a net $44.7 million flowed out of EWU, which returned 6.91% over that period. But this year, the tables have turned. Sterling has stabilized, drawing investors back into EWU.
The fund has benefited from the recent strength of the U.K. financial sector, Mr. Yadava says. In addition, the large- cap U.K. companies in its portfolio are internationally focused and so aren't as affected as smaller companies might be by concerns about Brexit's effect on the U.K. economy, he says.
""These are global brands, and they source their revenues predominantly from outside the U.K,"" Mr. Yadava says. But he warns that there is uncertainty looking forward, particularly over the impact of Brexit on international business. For instance, it is unclear if U.K.-based financial firms will be able to provide their services as freely across Europe as they currently do once the country leaves the EU.

HSBC,Your Money's Safe at HSBC," Aug 7, 2017",1,"HSBC HOLDINGS AND STANDARD CHARTERED BOTH TRACE THEIR origins back to the days of the British Empire, but their more recent history tells two different stories.
The London-based, Asia-focused lenders have spent the past few years in convalescence following the global financial crisis. But investors view one as further along the road to recovery, which was evident in recent interim earnings. Both banks topped analyst estimates on profits, but HSBC's (ticker: HSBC) stock soared while Standard Chartered's (STAN.UK) dropped like a stone.
Under the hood, it isn't hard to see why. HSBC's return on equity, or profit returned as a percentage of shareholder equity, edged up to 8.8%, compared with 7.4% a year ago. While Standard Chartered's current 5.2% is much improved from last year's 2.1%, it's still measly by global standards.
That's because HSBC has spent much of the last year buttering up investors, with the stock up almost 60% in that time. Aside from the shares' tantalizing 5% dividend yield, the lender has spent billions of idle cash buying back stock, including a $2 billion bonanza alongside its most recent results. There was no such generosity from Standard Chartered: Dividend payments have been on hold for the past two years, despite an improving Tier 1 capital ratio-a measure of financial strength.
Some investors may be tempted to bet on Standard Chartered, whose stock has lagged behind HSBC's this past year. They shouldn't. For one thing, more goodies may be on the way from HSBC. The bank has billions of dollars trapped in the U.S., which it seeks to repatriate to the group. Depending on the pace that U.S. regulators permit, at least some of the money will go to more buybacks.
HSBC's immediate prospects look better, too. For example, its bottom line is more sensitive to rising interest rates than Standard Chartered's. And HSBC's business in fast-growing Asia is more profitable, driven by strong loan growth. Standard Chartered's lending in the continent has stalled.
For some, that makes the choice simple. ""You are getting paid to wait with HSBC,"" says Douglas Morton, head of Asian research at Northern Trust Capital Markets, referring to the bank's big dividend. BNP Paribas has a target of 88.37 Hong Kong dollars (US$ 11.30) on the stock, about 15% above last week's level..
HSBC's incoming Chairman Mark Tucker should be a happy man. The former chief of Hong Kong life insurer AIA Group (1299.Hong Kong) will take the reins from Douglas Flint in October. Tucker's first order of business will be hiring a replacement for outgoing CEO Stuart Gulliver, who retires in 2018. Tucker inherits a fitter HSBC than his predecessor did. Flint's era saw HSBC fined almost $2 billion for its dealings with Mexican drug cartels, and a lengthy hangover from a disastrous deal to buy a U.S. subprime lender.
Tucker will have his own list of challenges. One is raising the bank's return on equity, which remains low versus international peers and short of HSBC's own 10% target. Rising rates should push that along. Asia veteran Tucker will also be eager to exploit HSBC's focus on the region by, among other things, capitalizing on China's huge One Belt, One Road infrastructure program. For Tucker, then, it looks like full speed ahead. ?

The co-managers of the $417 million Janus Henderson Strategic Income fund (ticker: HFAAX) have shared periods of stress-they took over the portfolio at the end of 2008, after it had lost 39% of its value-and milestones of success. The fund ended 2009 up more than 50% and has returned an average of 5.4% a year over the past five years, better than 98% of its Morningstar world-bond-category peers.
Along the way, they have learned the value of questioning conventional wisdom-and each other. ""It's when we fully agree with each other that we tend to make mistakes,"" says Barnard, 37. After the financial crisis, like many bond
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 746 of 1177
managers, they assumed interest rates could only go up after decades of decline. They positioned the fund on the short side of the yield curve, and paid the price with middling returns in 2010 and virtually no appreciation in 2011. It was ""the biggest mistake of our career,"" says Barnard, and a ""seminal moment"" for the duo, who oversee $5.5 billion in assets for Henderson Group, which merged with Janus Capital Group in late May.
After that, the London-based managers turned a more skeptical eye to what they learned as students of economics- she at Oxford University and he at the University of St. Andrews in his native Scotland-and sought alternative views. They were particularly struck by the observations of Richard Koo, the chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute, who draws parallels between Japan's stagnation and that of other developed nations. ""The idea that just lowering rates suddenly means everyone will borrow again is wrong,"" says Pattullo, 47, adding that the financial crisis has changed how consumers and companies, particularly in Europe, think about debt. At the same time, new forces, including an aging population and technology (i.e., Amazon.com's impact on retail pricing and Uber Technologies' impact on transportation) add to slower-than-expected growth.
While many of their peers remain ""duration neutral,"" Barnard and Pattullo move up and down the yield curve opportunistically, and think slow growth will keep inflation- and interest rates-relatively low for the foreseeable future. Against that backdrop, they look for opportunities to buy fixed-income securities when the market overreacts to signals suggesting the contrary. ""Investors tend to get overly bearish and overly bullish on inflation,"" says Barnard.
When U.S. Treasury yields shot up in 2013's taper tantrum, for example, the managers added 1.8 years of duration to the fund via 10-year United Kingdom and U.S. government bonds, while many managers were shortening duration (a measure of a bond's sensitivity to changes in interest rates, expressed in years). That trade alone added 0.3 percentage point performance to the fund.
Following Brexit, they bought longerdated U.K. government bonds-bringing the fund's duration to seven years- betting the Bank of England would cut rates and embark on more quantitative easing, which it did. And after Donald Trump's election, they started reducing the fund's duration, ultimately taking it down to 3.5 years, by shorting U.S. in- terest-rate futures. ""We thought the selloffin government bonds was a 'trade,' not a regime shiftto higher yields that would persist. Hence the buying opportunity,"" says Barnard.
The fund's duration was recently 4.3 years, on the lower end of where it has been over the past five years. ""We're trying to be patient and wait for the next opportunity,"" says Pattullo, who credits the fund's senior analysts, Rebecca Young and Nicholas Ware, with helping spot and vet ideas that meld with his and Barnard's macroeconomic view.
While they don't fear deflation, Barnard and Pattullo stick with noncyclical sectors, such as packaging, tobacco, and cable, and favor bonds issued by such global titans as Apple, Oracle, and Microsoft.
They generally don't own cyclicals-the unpredictable cash flow is too risky. One exception is financials, which are 14% of assets. Over the past few years, the managers have favored specific legacy European bank bonds issued by the likes of HSBC. Tighter regulations, they say, are likely to result in the bonds' issuers buying them back at a premium; meanwhile, the bonds are yielding from 4% to 5.5%. (In March 2016, Barclays did so at nearly $1.16 on the dollar.)
Although high-yield bonds account for a third of the fund's assets, the managers have been steadily reducing this position, noting that the yields for many of them no longer justify the additional risk. Likewise, they have virtually no investments in emerging markets, despite the fund's world-bond categorization. ""It isn't our expertise, and it isn't what investors expect,"" says Barnard. Instead, a third of the fund's assets are in U.S. fixed income; 30% is in the U.K., and 20% in Europe.
None of their asset-allocation decisions are dictated by the benchmark, where ""the companies and countries that have issued the most debt dominate,"" Barnard says. And the divergence of monetary policies across global markets is an underappreciated phenomenon: ""I don't think it's getting the attention it deserves.""
Case in point is Australia, which recently accounted for more than 9% of the fund, with its government bonds among some of the largest single positions. In late October, the fund began buying four-year government bonds
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 747 of 1177

yielding 1.8%, and later it initiated a position in longer-dated bonds.
""Australia has been a big focus for us,"" says Barnard. While the country hasn't had a recession in nearly 26 years- its commodity- rich economy and government policy helped it sidestep the financial crisis- increasing private- sector leverage, a late-cycle housing market, and Amazon's impact on the retail sector are worth watching. ""Those negatives are actually positives for government bonds because the central bank may need to respond with cuts,"" she says. ?"
HSBC,AThreat to Hong Kongs Rally," Aug 14, 2017",1,"IN HONG KONG, BORING IS GOOD. THE CITY PRIDES ITSELF ON efficiency and its ability to put business first. That applies to its currency, too, which has been pegged to the U.S. dollar for three decades.
But the boring Hong Kong dollar could soon get investors' pulses racing. The local Hang Seng Index is among the world's top performing markets year to date, returning more than 22%. However, the weakening local currency threatens to derail that rally.
That isn't something investors normally worry about. The Hong Kong dollar trades in a narrow band versus the greenback. If it approaches either end of that range, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, or HKMA-the city's de facto central bank-steps in to buy or sell Hong Kong dollars and steady the ship. To maintain that equilibrium, the authority follows U.S. monetary policy. The system has its detractors, but it has served the financial hub reasonably well.
However, the Hong Kong dollar hasn't been following the normal script this year. From early January to mid- August, the currency slid from the lower end of its band (meaning it was stronger relative to the dollar) to the precipice of the higher end (weaker).

Kong's banks didn't. The three-month U.S. dollar-based London interbank borrowing rate is now about 70% higher than its Hong Kong dollar-based equivalent. The prime rate, the benchmark for mortgage rates at Hong Kong banks, hasn't budged since the financial crisis. That's because the city's banks are flush with cash from years of quantitative easing and inflows from the mainland. This cheap money has fueled the bull market in Hong Kong stocks and real estate.
That could soon change. The closer the Hong Kong dollar creeps to the high end of its band, the more likely it is that the HKMA will intervene by buying the currency and mopping up liquidity. Fewer Hong Kong dollars in the system mean banks will start charging more to lend them. ""That will have some impact on equity investors because the cost of funds will increase,"" Alex Wong, director of asset management at Ample Capital, tells Barron's. In mid-August, the HKMA sold some debt to soak up liquidity.
Interest-rate-sensitive stocks would be among the obvious casualties. Think Hong Kong real estate, for example. Higher mortgage rates could cool red-hot demand for property-that wouldn't bode well for developers such as Sun Hung Kai Properties (ticker: 16.Hong Kong) or Sino Land (83.Hong Kong).
There's an added complication to the Hang Seng's bull run. Three blue-chip stocks-Tencent Holdings (700.Hong Kong), HSBC (5.Hong Kong), and insurer AIA Group (1299.Hong Kong)-have all been strong and account for 20% of the market valuation. ""That's why the Hang Seng Index isn't weak"" despite the sliding currency, says Wong. Fears about rates could stoke market volatility.
Hong Kong investors who are braced for higher rates should focus on undervalued names that won't feel ill effects when the era of cheap Hong Kong dollars ends. Ample's Wong says Macau gaming stocks look like a good bet right now because they will benefit long-term from plans to link the enclave to Hong Kong and mainland China via an ambitious new bridge network."

HSBC,"Eurozone Growth Spreads, Helped by Dutch, Italian Economies; Currency area is becoming less reliant on Germany and Spain"," Aug 16, 2017",0,"
The eurozone's recovery was more rapid than first estimated in the three months to June as a pickup that started in Germany and Spain has spread to other parts of the currency area, aiding a comeback that is proving vital to the world economy.
The European Union's statistics agency Wednesday raised its measure of eurozone economic growth during the second quarter to 2.5% annualized from its first estimate of 2.3%, bringing it closer to the 2.6% recorded by the U.S., which it outpaced in the first quarter.
That upgrade comes at an opportune moment, since the U.S. is growing more weakly than expected and there are signs China may be set for a slowdown .
Separate figures showed the Dutch economy surged during the period as exports jumped, while Italy recorded its strongest six months since the second half of 2010.
""The eurozone recovery continues, and seems to be broadening out,"" said Fabio Balboni, an economist at HSBC. The bloc's strength during the first half of 2017 has come as a surprise to most economists, who had expected growth to slow in response to rising energy prices and heightened political uncertainty as voters in the Netherlands, France and Germany chose new governments.
However, the rise in energy prices didn't last long and elections in the Netherlands and France--in March and May respectively--produced wins for pro-euro centrists and reduced the threat of a breakup of the currency area. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has a large lead in opinion polls ahead of September's elections.
As Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte worked to form a new government, the country's economy surged in the second quarter, recording its fastest expansion since the final three months of 2007. According to the Dutch statistics agency, gross domestic product--the broadest measure of the goods and services produced by an economy--was 1.5% higher than in the three months through March and 3.8% up on the comparable period a year earlier. That was largely the result of a jump in exports, with overseas sales 11% higher in June than a year earlier. As a result, the Dutch economy overtook Spain's as the fastest-growing of the eurozone's five largest members. It had previously enjoyed steady if modest growth, expanding by 0.6% in the first quarter.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 755 of 1177
The CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis said Wednesday it now expects the Dutch economy to grow by more than 3% in 2017 as a whole, the first year in which it will have done so since the financial crisis. ""The Dutch economy is well on the rise,"" the body said in its new report.
The eurozone's pickup has also been supported by slightly stronger growth in Italy, which recorded a third straight quarter in which GDP rose by 0.4%. Compared with a year earlier, the Italian economy was 1.5% larger, the fastest rate of expansion since the first three months of 2011.
""The Italian economy, which admittedly is still one of the weakest, is finally showing signs of life,"" said Shweta Singh, an economist at Lombard Street Research.
Despite the steady growth, Italy's economy is still 6.5% smaller than it was before the financial crisis. Only Greece, with an economy that is 27% smaller, has performed worse in the past 10 years.
Spain and Germany were largely responsible for driving the eurozone's modest growth between the start of the recovery in mid-2013 and the end of 2016. But the broadening of the recovery in 2017 has contributed to its acceleration.
Eurostat didn't give details of the drivers of eurozone growth, but economists say national data releases suggest consumer and investment spending were the main factors, with exports playing a lesser role, except in the Netherlands and France.
The strength of the eurozone economy has prompted economists to raise their forecasts for the year as a whole. According to Consensus Economics--which tracks forecasters--the average growth rate for this year projected by the 29 institutions it follows is now 2%, up from the 1.4% expected in December.
The eurozone's acceleration has fueled expectations the European Central Bank will start to wind down its purchases of government bonds from January. However, there are few signs the pickup in growth has transformed the outlook for inflation, which is well below the ECB's target of just under 2%.
""With the economy maintaining a healthy pace of growth, the ECB should feel fairly confident about tapering its asset purchases next year,"" Jessica Hinds, an analyst at Capital Economics, said. ""But with GDP growth yet to boost inflation meaningfully, we doubt the bank will raise interest rates until early 2019.""
There are signs the eurozone's pickup is aiding other parts of Europe with which it has close trade and financial ties.
The Czech economy was 2.3% larger in the second quarter than the first, while Sweden's economy grew by 1.7%. Earlier in August, the Czech central bank raised its key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade , a milestone for Europe's central banks that have taken dramatic easing steps to prop up their economies.

HSBC,Gold Prices Edge Lower Ahead of Jackson Hole Speeches; Investors focus on meeting of global central bankers for clues on precious metal's direction," Aug 24, 2017",1,"Gold prices inched lower Thursday, with many investors and analysts keeping a watchful eye on a meeting of global central bankers.
Gold for December delivery closed down 0.2% at 1,292.00 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Price movements have been muted since the precious metal hit its highest level since November last Friday, with some investors waiting to see if gold can break through the $1,300 level and stay there. Gold has flirted with $1,300 multiple times this year, but some analysts think it will need a further boost from the world's central banks or geopolitical uncertainty to break through the key psychological barrier for many investors. As a result, many are keeping an eye on the economic symposium in Jackson Hole , Wyo., Thursday through Saturday for clues about whether the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank might be more aggressive in unwinding their financial stimulus programs. A longer period without interest-rate increases typically supports gold, which often struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets like Treasurys when rates rise.
The pause among investors is likely due to profit-taking and many awaiting Friday speeches from Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen and ECB President Mario Draghi, said James Steel, chief precious metals analyst at HSBC.
A weaker dollar has boosted gold this year by making the dollar-denominated metal less expensive to foreign buyers, and the U.S. currency was also little changed Thursday. The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against 16 other currencies, was recently up less than 0.1%.
Among base metals, copper for September delivery closed up 1.8% at $3.0340 a pound--its highest level since November 2014. Confidence in the Chinese economy and supply disruptions have buoyed prices this summer , but some remain concerned that the industrial metal's rapid run up has left it susceptible to a pullback. Prices are up roughly 15% in the last two months.

HSBC,Palladium Prices Are on a Tear; Prices for the precious metal are up 37% this year," Aug 26, 2017",0,"
Platinum bulls are hearing footsteps--from the precious metal's close relative palladium.
Palladium has been a standout even amid the recent boom in industrial metals like copper, surging to its highest levels since 2001 amid a yearslong supply deficit. For the year, prices are up 37%, and some analysts and investors think palladium could soon cost more than platinum--a shift that would reverse a longstanding relationship and, in the eyes of some analysts, likely lead to changes in auto-industry material uses.
On Friday, palladium for August delivery closed down $5.10, or 0.5%, to $933.45. Front-month platinum closed down 3.50, or 0.4%, at 976.30.
Technically a precious metal, palladium often behaves like a base metal because of its use in the catalytic converters that filter car emissions in engines.
Many manufacturers began substituting palladium for platinum because it was widely available and cheaper in the early 2000s. But a continued palladium rally could lead them to consider switching back to platinum, said Pete Duncan, director of market research at Johnson Matthey.
Johnson Matthey expects palladium to soon cost more than platinum, Mr. Duncan said, as demand from China and other global markets has kept the recent rally going despite concerns about slowing U.S. auto sales.
""The whole situation is coming to a head,"" said Shree Kargutkar, portfolio manager at Sprott Asset Management, adding that manufacturers considering switching back to platinum ""makes a ton of sense.""
Investors have continued to wager on further gains even with palladium's rapid run-up. Net long positions by hedge funds and other speculative investors on palladium futures totaled 25,153 contracts in the week ended Tuesday, the most since November 2013, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.
Still, not everyone agrees that palladium passing platinum would lead to auto-industry changes.
Given the amount of technical work and testing to switch metals used in catalysts, a shift isn't likely unless manufacturers think recent trends in prices will be sustained, said James Steel, chief precious-metals analyst at HSBC. Mr. Steel noted that switching to palladium has taken a lot of time.
""I think they would be unlikely to reverse that course without a lot of consideration,"" he said.
Mr. Kargutkar said he thinks platinum still provides a better value alternative to owning palladium; platinum prices have risen 8.3% this year. He said platinum also is in short supply and could soon draw more interest given palladium's sharp rise.

HSBC,New York Stock Exchange Composite List," Aug 28, 2017",1,"Inflation in the eurozone picked up markedly in August while the region's jobless rate remained at its lowest level for more than eight years, underpinning expectations that the European Central Bank may soon announce a gradual withdrawal from its massive stimulus programs.
The annual inflation rate climbed to 1.5% from 1.3% in July, propelled by energy prices, the European Union's statistics agency said. The region's unemployment rate, meanwhile, was unchanged at 9.1% in July, the latest available data point, which marks the lowest level since February 2009.
Against the backdrop, ""the ECB's strong policy support is becoming less necessary,"" said Jennifer McKeown, an economist at Capital Economics.
The ECB has come under pressure from some German officials and private-sector economists to wind down its monthly bond purchases amid signs that the region's economic recovery is broadening.
ECB President Mario Draghi has said that a decision with regard to quantitative easing, as the bond purchases are known, is likely this fall, but economists on Thursday remained divided on the timing of an announcement.
In any case, the ECB will need to tread carefully, they said. A strengthening euro is threatening economic growth and the revival of inflation in the eurozone by crimping the international competitiveness of the region's exporters and reducing the cost of imports.
""We think that the ECB will bide its time after its meeting next week before announcing a gradual asset purchase taper in October,"" Ms. McKeown said.
Inflation in August was above a consensus forecast of 1.4%, but it continues to undershoot the ECB's target of ""below, but close to"" 2%.
In addition, Eurostat's measure of core inflation--which eliminates volatile components such as food and energy-- was flat at 1.2%. Economists said that there is little reason to believe that core inflation will move much higher soon.
""Despite the continued cyclical recovery and the likelihood of further declines in unemployment, the strong euro means that the ECB is likely to revise down its inflation forecast at its next policy meeting on Sept. 7,"" said Chris Hare, an economist at HSBC.
Separately, Germany's VMDA engineering federation said Thursday that plant and machinery orders in July surged 10% from July last year, a development that is likely to underpin industrial production in the months ahead.

HSBC,Banks Close $1.5 Billion Loan for Flagship Tower at Hudson Yards; A venture led by Related Cos. is funding the rest of the $3.8 billion tower," Sep 4, 2017",1,"
The developer of the Hudson Yards complex on Manhattan's West Side has hit another milestone with a financing package for its flagship office building that will increase the money it has raised for the first phase of the sprawling project to more than $18 billion.
A venture led by Related Cos. has closed a $1.5 billion construction loan for 50 Hudson Yards from a group of banks from Asia, Europe and the U.S. The rest of the money for the $3.8 billion tower--the largest in the complex--is being provided by Related and its partners on 50 Hudson, Oxford Properties Group and Mitsui Fudosan America Inc., Related said.
The 2.9 million square foot building is expected to be completed in 2022. BlackRock Inc., the world's largest money manager, has agreed to be its anchor tenant.
The financing is the latest sign that Related's vision for what used to be 26 acres of windswept rail yards just east of the Hudson River is becoming a reality. The $18 billion of financing that has been raised also has gone to a new headquarters for Time Warner Inc., Kohlberg, Kravis &Roberts, Coach Inc. and numerous other big-name New York businesses.
When Related won the bid for the site in 2008, many were skeptical that the site--so far away from the city's traditional business districts--would be able to attract a critical mass of office tenants, retailers and residents. The financial crisis that year further seemed to doom its prospects.
But the development was boosted by the opening of a new stop on the 7 train in 2015. The popularity of the High Line park also helped the project, which is at the northern end of the walkway.
Hudson Yards comprises more than 18 million square feet of mixed-use development with about 4,000 residences and more than 100 shops and restaurants. The plan also includes 14 acres of public space and a 750-seat public school.
The group of lenders providing the $1.5 billion senior construction loan to 50 Hudson Yards includes Wells Fargo &Co.; Deutsche Bank AG; HSBC Holdings PLC; Bank of China and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.

HSBC,"So Long Sweden: Its Biggest Bank Is Moving Because of Regulation; Nordea Bank, the Nordics' biggest lender, will move its headquarters from Sweden to Finland, saving as much as [euro]1 billion"," Sep 6, 2017",1,"Faced with tougher regulations, bankers sometimes threaten to decamp to a friendlier jurisdiction. Now a financial institution actually has.
Nordea Bank AB, the Nordics' biggest lender, said Wednesday it would move its headquarters from Sweden to Finland, which is inside the eurozone's banking union, saving as much as [euro]1 billion. Nordea said it would make the switch to Helsinki in the second half of next year. (Finland uses the euro; Sweden does not.)
Banks have in the past threatened to quit countries for friendlier climes but rarely go through with it. HSBC Holdings PLC, for instance, has repeatedly said it would consider moving away from London but last year decided to stay put . Nordea's move marks the first time since the financial crisis that a major European bank has uprooted for regulatory reasons.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 773 of 1177
Earlier this year, Nordea said it was considering leaving Sweden after the country proposed increasing the fees banks pay to help cover the cost of saving them if they get into trouble. The country also has some of the strictest capital requirements in Europe. Nordea, which does business across Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland, said the move would save it around [euro]1 billion in resolution fees and deposit guarantees compared to remaining in Sweden.
""We wanted predictability,"" says Casper von Koskull, Nordea's chief executive officer.
Under European Union rules, the European Central Bank supervises the biggest banks across the eurozone. This supervision, which has been in progress since 2014, aims to impose rules evenly across the currency bloc, with common rules for winding down banks eventually backed by a system of common depositor protection.
For bigger banks that's a lure: while a player like Nordea may be huge in its domestic market, it's small compared with the eurozone as a whole. Nordea's assets as of the end of 2016 are triple Finland's gross domestic product, but inside the eurozone's banking union it is only a midsize player. Analysts expect Nordea's capital requirement to shrink when the ECB becomes its lead regulator, because the ECB's rules are less stringent than Sweden's. The bank said in a statement it was too early to know the impact on its capital requirements.
For the banking union, Nordea might make a good addition. The lender had previously held preliminary discussions to merge with Dutch bank ABN AMRO Group NV, in part to have the possibility to move its headquarters to the Netherlands. Analysts see Nordea as an active player in any eventual European banking consolidation. ECB officials are pining for a big cross border EU deal to validate the banking union project.
For Sweden its a bitter blow. In 1991, the Swedish state took a stake in Nordbanken, which later became Nordea, to help shore up the lender. The state then took over the rest of Nordbanken in 1992 amid what became a deep national financial crisis. The Swedish state only sold its remaining shares in 2013.
Nordea shares will remain listed on the stock exchanges of Stockholm, Helsinki and Copenhagen.

HSBC,"Dow Climbs Back Above 22000 as Fears Ease; Haven assets, including U.S. government bonds and gold, retreat"," Sep 11, 2017",1,"The S&P 500 hit a fresh record and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 22000 for the first time in nearly a month, as investors' fears about North Korea and Hurricane Irma eased.
Stocks rose broadly and haven assets retreated Monday, a reversal from last week when major U.S. stock indexes , the dollar and Treasury yields fell as investors worried about worst-case scenarios from summer storms and threats from North Korea .
The gains sent the Dow up 259.58 points, or 1.2%, to 22057.37, its biggest one-day gain in six months. The last time the Dow closed above 22000 was Aug. 16, and before Monday it hadn't posted a 1% gain since April.
The S&P 500 rose 26.68 points, or 1.1%, to 2488.11--its 31st record close of 2017--and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 72.07 points, or 1.1%, to 6432.26.
Some analysts had expected North Korea to conduct a weapons test on Saturday, coinciding with the country's
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 775 of 1177
founding day, as it did last year to mark the celebration. The absence of news from Pyongyang supported stocks and the dollar, while weighing on haven assets, analysts say.
""That North Korea didn't do anything, on a weekend they knew our country was going to be in flux because of hurricanes, is the primary reason we're seeing this big rally,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. ""The market has gone back up to where we were in early August before these North Korea fears."" Government-bond prices declined , pushing up yields. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 2.125% from 2.058% Friday, its largest one-day yield rise in more than a month.
Meanwhile, concerns about Hurricane Irma's impact on the U.S. economy decreased. A reduction in the storm's strength and a shift in its expected course --there was no direct hit on Miami --meant insured damage estimates were likely to be less than originally anticipated by some analysts.
Reinsurance companies, which tumbled last week, jumped on Monday . The KBW Nasdaq Insurance index rose 1.8%, nearly wiping out last week's 1.9% drop.
The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. dollar against a basket of other currencies, rose 0.7%, after sinking to its lowest level in more than two years on Friday. The euro fell 0.7% against the greenback, paring some of last week's gains, to trade at $1.1953.
The Stoxx Europe 600 advanced 1%, boosted by gains in bank, insurance and technology shares--sectors that tend to rally when investors feel confident enough to take on more risk.
Gold, another traditional haven for money managers, fell 1.1%. The yen and the Swiss franc, which traditionally rise when markets are volatile, both fell against the U.S. dollar.
A weaker yen boosted Japanese blue-chip stocks. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average rose 1.4%, after setting fresh four- month lows on Friday and logging its worst week in seven months.

HSBC,Tech Stocks Fuel Emerging-Markets Rally; The technology sector of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index is up 54% this year," Sep 19, 2017",1,"
A small group of technology shares are pushing major stock indexes to new highs. That has been true for a while with the S&P 500. Now it is playing out the same way in emerging markets.
Tech companies have powered this year's rally in the developing world, helping the MSCI Emerging Markets Index's performance rise 29% as of Monday, the highest in six years.
Top performers include South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and fast-growing Chinese e-commerce companies Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd.
The emerging-markets tech sector's return, at 54%, is nearly double the overall index for the year through Monday, according to MSCI.
The rise of technology companies represents a major reversal from earlier years, when banks, utilities and commodities producers dominated stock trading in the developing world. In 1995, when global investing in emerging-markets stocks started to take off, tech shares accounted for only 2% of the index, according to MSCI.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 783 of 1177
Now, tech companies make up about 27% of the emerging-markets index, according to the latest figures. That is slightly more than U.S. tech stocks' share of the S&P 500's market value, which was nearly 24% at the end of August.
""Emerging markets are past that first stage of growth where you're just industrializing and building roads,"" said Nicholas Field, an emerging-markets portfolio manager at Schroders.
As emerging-markets investing looks more like investing in the developed world, these stocks are increasingly subject to the same global consumer trends as those in the U.S.
For some investors, this makes these companies a less expensive way to buy into a global technology rally. Emerging-markets tech shares are trading at roughly 20.4 times their past 12 months of earnings, compared with 24.5 times for tech stocks in the U.S., according to MSCI.
""What's driving the stock-price growth really is earnings growth,"" said John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management Americas Inc., whose firm has been buying Asian tech stocks. ""It comes from the domestic economy, which is adopting the internet in general and even more rapidly than the Western world.""
Michael Lippert, portfolio manager of Baron Opportunity Fund, is also bullish on internet-related companies globally, with investments in Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Alibaba and Tencent.
""Data's the new oil,"" said Mr. Lippert. ""The tech leaders of yesterday sold you a product--software or hardware--and then they disappeared. They didn't have a connection to you. They couldn't personalize their service.""
But some money managers say the tech rally in developing countries looks overdone. The $65 million ICON Emerging Markets Fund has lightened up on holdings such as Alibaba and Tencent, ""which have reached a euphoric type of position in the minds of many investors,"" said Rob Young, a manager of the fund. These stocks are highly sensitive to earnings growth, and if there is any slight deceleration, the stocks get hammered, he said. Ben Laidler, a global equity strategist at HSBC, said investing in emerging markets hasn't changed all that much, even if the type of companies is different.
He is overweight emerging-markets technology because he thinks it is still a bet on growth in the developing world. In China, the biggest equity market in emerging markets, 71% of tech-sector revenue is from within the country, Mr. Laidler noted.
""Acceleration of growth in China has been a big part of the tech sector,"" he said. ""Tech is increasingly developed by China.""

HSBC,Toys 'R' Us Bankruptcy Filing Batters Some of Retailer's Debt; Divergence in filing's effect on different debt highlights complexity of company's capital structure," Sep 20, 2017",0,"Toys ""R"" Us Inc.'s bankruptcy filing this week has sparked a rout in some of the company's debt, as investors grapple with the fallout from the unexpected move by the well-known retailer.
The company's unsecured bonds due in 2018 collapsed to 18 cents on the dollar after the filing on Monday from 97 cents on the dollar just three weeks ago, according to MarketAxess. They were recently trading at around 26 cents.
Not all Toys ""R"" Us debt has declined to the same degree in recent days and weeks, a divergence that highlights the complexity of the company's capital structure, the product of a 2005 leveraged buyout by KKR &Co., Bain Capital and Vornado Realty Trust. The firms purchased Toys ""R"" Us for $6.6 billion, using $1.4 billion of their own capital and funding the remainder with debt.
Starting in 2014, Toys ""R"" Us engaged in several debt exchanges with its bond and loan holders. In many of these exchanges, the company sliced off its most valuable assets, such as equity in its international operations and intellectual property behind its brand name, to offer them to holders if they were willing to extend maturities.
A $998 million term loan at the company's Toys ""R"" Us-Delaware Inc. subsidiary--which is backed by equity in the company's better performing Canadian division, among other assets--has lost just 17 cents on the dollar since mid- June, having been quoted Wednesday at roughly 66 cents on the dollar, according to Markit.
Several holders of the loan, including Franklin Resources Inc., were in talks with the company before Monday's chapter 11 filing to provide it with a debtor-in-possession loan to keep operations going, according to court documents. Franklin owned nearly $180 million of the term loan as of July 31, according to Ipreo, a market- intelligence firm.
Franklin began to prepare for a potential restructuring of Toys ""R"" Us years ago when it participated in deals with the company that improved its position in the debt stack. At the end of July, the company was also a major holder of the 2018 bonds, with funds managed by the firm holding more than $24 million, according to Ipreo. A spokesman for Franklin declined to comment.
Bonds secured by equity in most of Toys ""R"" Us's international unit, including its valuable Chinese operations, changed hands Wednesday at 93.5 cents on the dollar, compared with roughly 96 cents at the end of last month, according to MarketAxess.
One school of thought among investors is that Toys ""R"" Us will emerge from bankruptcy protection a stronger company. The retailer, which had $628 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the fiscal year ended January, has been spending roughly $400 million a year to service its debt. A new capital structure could alleviate some of that pressure, allowing it to invest more in its business.
So far, fallout from the filing has been largely contained to Toys ""R"" Us's debt, sparing the bonds of other retailers and the high-yield market in general. Still, the situation is sobering to investors, suggesting that other retailers that have suffered from the rise of e-commerce competitors could also ""unravel very quickly because you have these kind of spiraling effects,"" said Ricky Liu, a high-yield-bond portfolio manager at HSBC Global Asset Management.

HSBC,BlackRock to Sell Singapore Office Tower for Nearly $1.6 Billion; The sale would mark one of the city-state's biggest property deals so far this year," Sep 21, 2017",1,"SINGAPORE--U.S. asset manager BlackRock Inc. plans to sell an office building in the heart of Singapore's business district to a local real-estate investment trust for 2.15 billion Singapore dollars (US$1.59 billion). CapitaLand Commercial Trust will buy Asia Square Tower 2 from BlackRock Asia Property Fund III LP, the Singapore-listed firm said in a filing to the central bank.
The sale would be one of Singapore's biggest real-estate deals so far this year and would be BlackRock's fourth property sale in the city-state since 2015. Last year, it sold its Asia Square Tower 1 in the Marina Bay district to Qatar sovereign-wealth fund Qatar Investment Authority for S$3.4 billion.
CapitaLand Commercial Trust said it would fund the acquisition with a rights issue and bank loans. The company is planning to sell 513.54 million rights units at S$1.363 each that will raise S$690.4 million (US$511.9 million), and will seek S$1.12 billion in bank borrowings.
The remainder would be funded by divestment proceeds from CapitaLand Commercial Trust's sale of its car park. BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset managers with US$5.4 trillion in assets under management, had taken ownership of Asia Square in 2013 when it acquired investment firm MGPA to bulk up its real-estate assets world- wide.
By acquiring MGPA, BlackRock gained control of its US$12 billion in assets under management, of which around two-thirds were in the Asia-Pacific region at the time of the deal.
The 46-story Asia Square Tower 2 building has one of the highest occupancy rates in the country and counts Mizuho Bank and insurers Allianz and Swiss Re among its tenants.
Rental income from premium Singapore office spaces showed signs of uptick in the second quarter after falling for eight consecutive quarters, real-estate advising firm CBRE Pte. Ltd. said.
""Economic indicators have firmed in recent months and, in tandem, prior fears around a supply overhang have also diminished as the new developments have been able to attract tenants,"" CBRE said. However, a return to strong demand may take some more time, it said.

HSBC,"Eurozone PMI Beats Forecasts, Pointing to Stronger Growth; Better-than-expected reading driven by Germany and France"," Sep 22, 2017",0,"The eurozone economy found fresh momentum in September and may have accelerated in the third quarter as a whole, according to surveys of purchasing managers released Friday.
The pickup is the latest positive surprise from an economy that has already outperformed most expectations this year. As it entered 2017, most economists expected to see a slowdown from a disappointing 2016. Instead, they have been forced to raise their projections, and the European Central Bank now thinks the economy will grow more rapidly than it has in a decade.
Data firm IHS Markit on Friday said its composite Purchasing Managers Index for the eurozone--based on survey responses from 5,000 manufacturers and service providers--rose to 56.7 in September from 55.7 in August, reaching its highest level since May.
That was a surprise, with economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal last week forecasting a drop to 55.6. A reading above 50 signals an increase in activity, while a reading below signals a decline.
The PMIs for July and August had suggested the eurozone economy was slowing very slightly, in line with economists' expectations. But the September jump has raised the average reading for the third quarter. Chris Williamson, IHS Markit's chief economist, said that points to quarter-to-quarter growth of 0.7%, up from 0.6% in the three months to June.
""The eurozone economy ended the summer with a burst of activity, with the PMI signaling renewed impetus to already-impressive rates of growth of output, order books and employment during September,"" he said. However, other economists are more cautious, pointing to economic data for July that pointed to a slowdown. Most see quarter-to-quarter growth remaining at, or coming in just below, the second quarter figure.
""We think that is an overly optimistic steer, particularly given relatively soft industrial production numbers coming from Germany,"" said Chris Hare, an economist at HSBC. ""But, while there is a possibility that the PMIs are overly bullish on growth, they do show businesses continuing to brim with optimism.""
The September revival was driven by Germany and France, the eurozone's largest members. France's PMI hit its highest level in 76 months, while its German equivalent was the highest in 77.
Coming into 2017, most economists expected a series of key elections across the eurozone to weigh on household and business sentiment, slowing spending. But as the last of those votes approaches in Germany on Sunday, it is clear political uncertainty hasn't had the impact they feared.
Indeed, some now suggest that the failure of political parties hostile to the euro to make larger gains may have been because of the economic pickup, with unemployment rates continuing to fall. According to the surveys of purchasing managers, businesses hired additional workers at the second fastest pace in a decade, falling just short of March's high.
Across the eurozone, manufacturers led the September charge, with activity growing at the fastest rate in more than six-and-a-half years as exports continued to rise, although there are signs new orders from overseas are starting to slow.
""Today's release confirms our view that, despite some concerns amongst investors, the recent appreciation of the euro is not sufficient to derail the region's economic momentum,"" said Julien Lafargue, an equities strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.
The eurozone's accelerating growth has reduced the need for ECB stimulus, and the central bank has signaled that
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 790 of 1177
it will next month announce plans for phasing out its bond-buying program. The strength of the PMI, which is closely watched by ECB policy makers, may help sway any who doubt that is the right course of action. However, there are few signs the pickup in growth has transformed the outlook for inflation, which is well below the ECB's target of just under 2%.

HSBC,Saudi Arabia Plans Another Bond Sale to Offset Falling Oil Revenue; The kingdom has been on a selling spree for more than a year to help plug a widening deficit," Sep 25, 2017",1,"
DUBAI--Saudi Arabia is planning to tap international debt markets again as the Persian Gulf's largest economy extends a borrowing spree to cope with a budget deficit caused by lower oil prices.
The bond issue would mark the kingdom's latest effort to raise funds internationally. Saudi Arabia last year raised $17.5 billion from debt markets, the largest debt sale ever from a developing economy. Earlier this year, the kingdom sold $9 billion worth of Islamic bonds. There are also regular domestic Islamic bond sales and the country has also borrowed from banks.
For more than a year, the country has been turning to the debt markets to raise fresh funds to offset falling oil revenues, plug a widening budget deficit and bankroll an economy transformation plan aimed at making it less reliant on the sale of oil. The kingdom is also involved in costly conflicts such as the war against Houthi rebels in Yemen and, more recently, is leading a blockade against Qatar , accusing its neighbor over fomenting extremism in the region.
Saudi Arabia's ministry of finance has hired U.S. banks J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs, Bahrain-based Gulf International Bank, U.K.-based HSBC and MUFG out of Japan to lead the newest sale of an international bond, which will have three tranches, according to two bankers who have been briefed on the issue.
Meetings and calls with fixed-income investors will start today and the sale could take place shortly after depending on market conditions, said one of the bankers.
Saudi Arabia's debt-raising efforts will help reduce the country's budget deficit, which the finance ministry said would come in at nearly 200 billion Saudi riyals ($53 billion) this year. The country hopes to balance its finances by 2020.
As Saudi Arabia has tightened the purse strings, the kingdom has burned through its foreign exchange reserves derived mostly from the sale of oil. Its foreign reserves resumed falling in July, according to central bank data, extending a drawdown that began in late 2014 when oil prices tumbled. That means Saudi reserves have now tumbled by more than $200 billion in less than three years. The July drop came despite a one-off recovery during the previous month of June.
Saudi Arabia will follow in the footsteps of fellow Gulf state Bahrain, which raised $3 billion earlier this month with the sale of conventional and Islamic bonds.
Saudi Arabia's economy remains weak with real gross domestic growth expected to contract by 0.3% this year, according to the Institute of International Finance. In addition, Saudi Arabia expects unemployment to remain above 12% in the absence of the strong non-oil growth that is needed to create enough new jobs for Saudi citizens.

HSBC,China Fishery Trustee Targets HSBC in Bankruptcy Probe; Trustee for company has asked bankruptcy judge to reaffirm his power to investigate HSBC," Sep 25, 2017",0,"The court-appointed trustee in charge of China Fishery Group Ltd. isn't backing down in a bankruptcy battle with HSBC Ltd., which he is investigating for aggressive collection tactics that allegedly had a ""severely negative impact"" on the fishing enterprise.
In court papers filed Thursday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York, the trustee, William Brandt Jr., asked a bankruptcy judge to reaffirm his power to investigate HSBC.
A hearing on the matter is set for Thursday.
Mr. Brandt has been largely successful in the long-running row with HSBC, winning a court order in July from Judge James Garrity Jr. allowing him to investigate the bank for collection efforts that Mr. Brandt said may have stunted China Fishery's operations.
""Some creditors may have overstepped their bounds,"" Mr. Brandt said in an interview last month.
China Fishery filed for chapter 11 protection in June 2016.
Mr. Brandt said HSBC is now ""trying to delay compliance"" with the judge's order, refusing to accept subpoenas for documents or to respond to other requests for information related to the probe. A lawyer for HSBC declined to comment Monday.
In court papers, HSBC, which said it is owed more than $100 million, has asked Judge Garrity for a temporary reprieve from the investigation while it pursues an appeal. HSBC said it would otherwise suffer ""irreparable harm"" from a ""costly and invasive"" process that it may be shut down by a higher court.
China Fishery is part of Pacific Andes Group, a collection of companies that together make up one of the world's largest seafood businesses.
Last month, Judge Garrity agreed to send China Fishery's considerable anchovy-harvesting operations off the coast of Peru to the auction block, where they are expected to fetch around $1.5 billion.
Tours of the Peruvian businesses began last month and will continue through mid-October, according to court papers. Bids are due Dec. 8, and an auction is set for Dec. 13.
The assets up for sale, repeatedly described in court hearings and court papers as China Fishery's ""crown jewels,"" include about 50 vessels and 10 processing plants as well as a ""significant percentage"" of the annual anchovy fishing quotas set by the Peruvian government, according to Mr. Brandt.
Mr. Brandt took over China Fishery late last year after lenders convinced Judge Garrity to wrest control of the business away from the Ng family, which founded it in Hong Kong 30 years ago. The family retains control of other affiliated entities not in chapter 11.
China Fishery filed for chapter 11 protection in June 2016, blaming financial woes largely tied to El Nin?o, which has

adversely affected Peruvian anchovy harvests in recent years. Court papers said those weather patterns have since subsided and the outlook for Peruvian anchovy fishing has improved.

HSBC,Saudi Arabia Sells $12.5 Billion of Bonds; Debt issue is largest by sovereign this year; marks Saudi Arabia's third foray in international markets since 2016," Sep 27, 2017",1,"DUBAI--Saudi Arabia on Wednesday sold $12.5 billion worth of bonds, the largest sovereign debt issue this year, as the kingdom taps the international markets again to bolster its finances hurt by lower oil prices.
The kingdom raised $3 billion of long five-year debt at 110 basis points over Treasurys, $5 billion of long 10-year bonds at 145 basis points over Treasurys and $4.5 billion of 30-year bonds at 180 basis points over Treasurys, according to one of the lead arranging banks.
Saudi Arabia and other major oil exporters of the Persian Gulf have increasingly turned to the international debt markets to plug budget deficits caused by the sharp fall in the price of oil since the middle of 2014.
The cash will help reduce the country's budget deficit, which the Saudi finance ministry said would come in at nearly 200 billion Saudi riyals ($53 billion) this year. The country hopes to balance its finances by 2020.
The kingdom is also in the middle of a far-reaching economic reform plan aimed at weaning the country off its oil dependence by boosting the private sector, attracting more foreign investments and diversifying income sources.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 798 of 1177
The bond sale marks Saudi Arabia's third foray in the international markets since the last quarter of 2016, when it raised a mammoth $17.5 billion , followed by the issue of $9 billion of Islamic bonds earlier this year. The kingdom has also sold billions of dollars worth of domestic bonds.
""The necessity of debt financing is to fund the deficit, but also to act as a bridge fund before some of the privatization efforts and efforts to attract FDI (foreign direct investment) bear fruit,"" says Karen Young, a political economist at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.
Saudi Arabia's ongoing debt raising efforts coincide with a period of profound socio-economic change taking place inside the kingdom. The country's young, 32-year old crown prince, Mohamed bin Salman, is overseeing a wide- ranging campaign to modernize the country and open up the economy to foreign investors.
The bond sale comes just a day after the government lifted the ban on women driving, a move that is expected to boost the participation rate of Saudi women in the domestic workplace.
Under Prince Salman, the government has taken some tough steps such as reducing energy subsidies, introducing new taxes and paring back state employees' perks, which Saudi citizens had grown accustomed to. He also announced plans to list the state-owned oil giant Aramco and privatize several state assets.
The government, however, has also backtracked on some of the more politically sensitive moves in recent months, such as delaying a planned increase in fuel prices and reinstating some government employee perks. More recently, the government admitted it was revising some parts of the reform program, which is known as Saudi Vision 2030.
Saudi Arabia also remains bogged down in a costly conflict in Yemen and is leading the blockade of its neighbor Qatar over allegations it sponsors extremist groups in the region, charges Doha denies.
Domestically, unemployment remains high, especially among the country's youth population, while despite the reforms the government continues to struggle to boost economic growth. The International Monetary Fund expects economic growth to be close to zero this year.
And even as Saudi Arabia has tightened the belt, the kingdom has burned through its cash reserves derived mostly from oil sales to keep the economy ticking. Its foreign reserves fell again in July, according to central-bank data, extending a drawdown that began in late 2014. That means Saudi reserves have now fallen by more than $200 billion in less than three years.
The bond issue comes after Saudi Arabian officials met fixed-income investors this week to gauge appetite for its debt. International investors have shown considerable interest in emerging market debt in search of higher yields, allowing Gulf sovereigns to raise record debt in the past year and a half. Fellow Gulf state Bahrain raised $3 billion earlier this month with the sale of conventional and Islamic bonds.
While Saudi public debt--both domestic and foreign--is rising, it will still remain relatively low at 20% of gross domestic product in 2017 and 25% of GDP in 2018, according to Garbis Iradian, chief economist for Middle East and North Africa at the Institute of International Finance.
U.S. banks J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs; Bahrain-based Gulf International Bank; U.K.-based HSBC; and MUFG out of Japan led the bond sale.

HSBC,"Saudi Arabia's Mega Bond Sale Sets Clock Ticking on Change; Past strengths are still a big support for Saudi bond buyers, but that can't last forever"," Sep 27, 2017",1,"Saudi Arabia has been forced by the collapse of oil prices onto a road of change: the lifting of the kingdom's ban on women driving is another clear signal of that. But the country's jumbo $12.5 billion bond sale, after last year's even bigger $17.5 billion debut issue , is as much about where Saudi Arabia has come from as where it hopes to go.
The kingdom has set out an extraordinarily ambitious plan to transform its economy and reduce its huge reliance on oil, including aiming for a balanced budget by 2020. But doubts abound about its ability to achieve its aims: they were part of the reason Fitch downgraded Saudi Arabia in March to single-A-plus.
For now, the oil price remains pivotal. Take the big swing in Saudi Arabia's fiscal numbers so far this year. The budget deficit, which topped 17% of gross domestic product in 2016, has narrowed sharply in the first half of 2017. Revenues in the first half were up 29% from the same period a year earlier, according to the Saudi Ministry of Finance. But that swing is thanks to a 63% rise in oil revenues, which still accounted for 69% of the total in the first half.
Equally important for bond investors is the strong starting point for the kingdom's balance sheet. In 2014, government debt stood at just 1.6% of GDP, notes Moody's; the ratings firm forecasts it will reach 20.6% in 2017. That is low compared with the weight of debt on many advanced-economy balance sheets. And Saudi Arabia is also benefiting from the search for yield: Its new 30-year bond was priced to yield 1.8 percentage points over Treasurys.
But these past strengths will count for less over time. The backdrop for bond issuers may become less supportive as U.S. interest rates rise. The path of the Saudi deficit in the next couple of years is key: HSBC thinks it will remain wide, at over 7% of GDP in 2018 and 2019, while growth remains limp.
For bond investors and Saudi Arabia, then, the clock is ticking. The picture right now means investors don't have to worry too much about credit risk; Saudi Arabia gets the funding it needs. But neither side can feel comfortable: in the next few years, Saudi Arabia's ability to generate non-oil revenues and growth will become the decisive factor. That remains far from certain.

HSBC,"Judge Puts China Fishery's Probe of HSBC on Hold; Bank would suffer 'irreparable injury' if investigation is allowed to proceed ahead of the appeal process, lawyer says"," Sep 28, 2017",1,"The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. won a temporary reprieve from an investigation into its collection practices leading up to China Fishery Group Ltd.'s bankruptcy.
During a hearing in New York Thursday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Garrity Jr. agreed to place the investigation, which he had authorized, on hold while lawyers for HSBC pursue an appeal.
""I think it makes sense to allow the District Court to complete her review of the matter,"" Judge Garrity said. ""Then we can see where things stand.""
William Brandt Jr., a bankruptcy court-appointed trustee currently marketing China Fishery's Peruvian fishing enterprise, won a court order from Judge Garrity in July allowing him to investigate the bank for aggressive collection efforts that Mr. Brandt says may have damaged China Fishery's business.
HSBC says it is being unlawfully burdened by having to litigate in a foreign jurisdiction. The bank says it has no connection to China Fishery in the U.S. and shouldn't be subjected to a bankruptcy probe by a U.S. court.
If Mr. Brandt's investigation is allowed to proceed ahead of the appeal process, the bank would suffer ""irreparable injury,"" Scott Gant, a lawyer for HSBC, told the judge Thursday.
Lawyers for HSBC, which says it is owed more than $100 million, said they are still awaiting a response to an appeal filed in U.S. District Court in New York.
China Fishery is part of Pacific Andes Group, a collection of companies that together make up one of the world's largest seafood businesses.

A sale of those assets is moving forward, and Mr. Brandt hopes to have the process completed before the end of the year.
In court Thursday, Mr. Brandt described the current sale effort as ""rather intense,"" but said he hoped to settle soon on a leading bid for the assets. ""We are literally sending teams back and forth to Lima,"" he said.
Mr. Brandt said several prospective buyers have been to Peru to evaluate the business and that many others have expressed interest.
During Thursday's hearing, Judge Garrity also said he would sign an order designed to help protect the Peruvian companies and the sale process from creditor collections actions and other interference in Peru.
Mr. Brandt took over China Fishery late last year at the request of lenders who convinced Judge Garrity to wrest control of the business away from the Ng family, which founded it in Hong Kong 30 years ago. The family retains control of other affiliated entities not in chapter 11.

HSBC,Fed Fines HSBC $175 Million for Foreign Exchange Trading Practices; The Federal Reserve said HSBC failed to detect its traders misusing confidential customer information," Sep 29, 2017",1,"
The Federal Reserve fined HSBC Holdings PLC $175 million for failing to adequately supervise its foreign-exchange trading business and said activities by two senior traders now being prosecuted are examples of the lack of oversight.
Mark Johnson, HSBC's former global head of foreign-exchange cash trading, is on trial in New York for allegedly trading ahead of a $3.5 billion currency transaction for a client. Mr. Johnson denies the charges. His lawyer didn't immediately return a call.
The Fed said the bank's deficient policies and procedures allowed Mr. Johnson and another senior trader, Stuart Scott, to misuse information ""in a manner that benefited them and their trading desk"" to the detriment of the client. Mr. Scott has also been charged and is contesting extradition from the U.K. to stand trial. He denies the charges. In 2011, HSBC client Cairn Energy PLC hired the bank to convert proceeds from the sale of an Indian subsidiary into sterling.
Prosecutors allege Messrs. Johnson and Scott bought pounds first for HSBC's own accounts, driving up the price. The bank made about $8 million from the trades, prosecutors say.
The Fed said the British bank ""failed to detect and address its traders misusing confidential customer information, as well as using electronic chat rooms to communicate with competitors about their trading positions.""
An HSBC spokesman said the bank was pleased to have resolved the matter with the Fed and declined to comment on Mr. Johnson's trial. The bank isn't named as a party in the action against Messrs. Johnson and Scott in New York.
The fine comes after other regulators also levied penalties and ordered remedial action at HSBC over activities in the same period between 2008 and 2013 that the Fed studied. But none had explicitly singled out the behavior of Messrs. Johnson and Scott.
Banks collectively have paid billions of dollars in penalties since a global regulatory probe into foreign-exchange market activities started in 2013.
The Fed on Friday ordered HSBC to improve risk management in its foreign-exchange business.

HSBC,"Passengers Stranded as Budget Carrier Monarch Airlines Collapses; U.K. mounts effort to bring home more than 100,000 travelers as carrier abruptly cancels all flights"," Oct 2, 2017",0,"
LONDON--Europe's hypercompetitive airline market has claimed another victim with Britain's Monarch Airlines Ltd. declaring bankruptcy, grounding its flights and leaving more than 100,000 passengers stranded overseas.
The British government said it would charter planes to help bring the 110,000 passengers stranded overseas home, with Transport Secretary Chris Grayling describing the effort as ""the country's biggest peacetime repatriation."" More than 60 flights were dispatched Monday bringing a first wave of about 12,000 passengers back to the U.K., Britain's airline regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, said Monday. Similar operations are expected to continue for about two weeks, the CAA said, with no charge to the passengers rescued.
In the U.S., a wave of consolidation among carriers has driven the bulk of traffic into the hands of a few airlines. That has helped the group that includes American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc., United Continental Holdings Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. to deliver handsome profits.
Europe's airline sector remains littered with niche players that have struggled to make money.
Monarch Airlines, owned by private-equity firm Greybull Capital LLP, was a British tourist airline that tried to remake itself as a budget carrier. Its failure comes after Italian flag carrier Alitalia and Germany's No. 2 airline by passengers, Air Berlin PLC, ran out of money this year. Strong competition from budget airlines such as Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's biggest airline by passengers, and rival easyJet PLC have forced down prices, crimping the prospects of carriers that can't compete on cost.
These European airline failures have implications as far away as the U.S. Air Berlin, though principally a European carrier, had to close trans-Atlantic routes.
Monarch is a big British customer for Boeing Co.'s new 737 Max jetliner.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 808 of 1177
The airline had placed orders for 32 of the planes almost three years ago, which have yet to be delivered. Monarch Chief Executive Andrew Swaffield said the airline was on track to lose £60 million ($80.4 million) this year and more than £100 million in 2018. The collapse in the value of the British currency after the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union last year also raised some dollar-denominated costs.
Efforts to find a buyer for the airline failed, he said.
Monarch was ""subscale"" and unit costs weren't competitive, HSBC analyst Andrew Lobbenberg said.
Monarch blamed its demise on a prolonged period of falling ticket prices, especially in markets on flights from the U.K. to Spain and Portugal.
Carriers have flooded planes into those two markets after terrorist attacks and political unrest in other tourist destinations, such as Turkey and Tunisia, drove travelers to the two western European countries viewed as safer. The string of bankruptcies in Europe could boost those airlines still flying by easing an oversupply of seats for sale that has kept airfares low.
Greybull Capital, which acquired Monarch in 2014 and last year had to inject more money into the carrier, said it was sorry it was unable to turn around the airline.
KPMG LLP, which is running the Monarch bankruptcy process, said the airline's rented planes were being returned to lessors. It also said talks with some 2,100 employees would take place Monday. Some would remain with the airline for a period to help repatriate customers.

HSBC,Abu Dhabi Launches $10 Billion Bond Sale; Oil exporters in the Persian Gulf tap international markets to boost finances hurt by weaker crude prices," Oct 3, 2017",1,"DUBAI---Abu Dhabi launched the sale of bonds worth $10 billion on Tuesday, raising cash from the international markets to help bolster the oil exporter's finances.
The emirate offered $3 billion of five-year debt at 65 basis points over Treasurys, $4 billion of 10-year bonds at 85 basis points over Treasurys and $3 billion of 30-year notes at 130 basis points over Treasurys, according to terms from one of the lead banks.
Final pricing was much tighter than the initial guidance after the emirate received orders in excess of $30 billion, according to the bank.
Abu Dhabi and other major oil exporters of the Persian Gulf are tapping international debt markets to plug budget deficits that have been caused by weaker oil prices since the middle of 2014. The emirate last raised $5 billion in April 2016--its first bond issue of this decade.
The bond sale comes after Saudi Arabia last week raised $12.5 billion--the largest sovereign debt issue of the year- -to support its finances.
Abu Dhabi, with about 6% of proven world oil reserves, derives a major chunk of its revenues from the hydrocarbon sector. That income has shrunk due to weaker oil prices, forcing the government to cut back on spending plans and review some major ongoing and proposed development projects after running a budget deficit since 2015. The emirate expects its fiscal deficit to narrow to about 13.73 billion dirhams ($3.74 billion) in 2017, from 25.91 billion dirhams last year, according to Abu Dhabi's bond prospectus. Cash from the bond sale will help cover the budget shortfall.
Abu Dhabi is one of the wealthiest states in the region, which over the years has deposited its surplus oil income in sovereign-wealth funds. These funds in turn have invested tens of billions of dollars in assets across the world, some of which yield strong returns. It is also working on diversifying its economy away from oil and gas by boosting the private sector.
Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch, Citi, First Abu Dhabi Bank, HSBC and J.P. Morgan jointly managed the issue for Abu Dhabi, which is a part of the seven-member semiautonomous United Arab Emirates.

HSBC,"Sorry, the Hong Kong Market Isn't Really a Bargain; The cheap Hang Seng masks some pricey--and potentially dangerous--stocks"," Oct 4, 2017",0,"Want great exposure to the global reflation story at a much lower price than U.S. equities? Don't buy Hong Kong. At first glance, it looks like a good deal, combining exposure to Chinese growth with the security of a mature market. Though near a 10-year high, the benchmark Hang Seng Index trades at only 12 times forward earnings-- well below the S&P 500's 18 times and the Nasdaq's 22 times.
The problem is, the Hang Seng is really just a play on some unexciting state-owned Chinese banks and one major Chinese technology company--social-media behemoth Tencent, owner of China's ubiquitous WeChat app. For a top-five global equity exchange, the Hong Kong market is strikingly undiversified. By weight, just six stocks account for over 40% of the 50-stock Hang Seng: Tencent--over 10% all by itself--HSBC and four massive Chinese banks and insurers.
Tencent is a very profitable company, but also one under increasing pressure from Beijing. It came into regulators' crosshairs during a recent internet crackdown for violating a new cybersecurity law . Along with three other tech highfliers, Tencent has also just been dragooned into Beijing's mixed-ownership experiment , taking a stake in ailing state-owned telecom giant China Unicom. Deals like these probably don't do much to boost shareholder value.
As for the banks, they've been bid up this year by investors cheering a fall in their nonperforming-loan ratios and solid Chinese growth. Much of the support comes from mainland investors, who can buy via trading links with Shanghai and Shenzhen. They own nearly 10% of the Hong Kong-listed shares of ICBC, China's biggest bank, up more than 3 percentage points just since March.
What these enthusiastic buyers may be overlooking is that China's cyclical improvement seems to have topped out . The real-estate market is weakening again and producer-price inflation is probably near its peak. That makes for better-than-even odds that debt problems will start popping up again next year , meaning the re-rating for China's banks is likely near its peak.
In other words, what you're really buying in Hong Kong is Chinese political risk and the country's shaky banking system. If that's what you're after, forge ahead--but investors looking for a cheap way to play global reflation would be better off with European indexes, which are nearly as cheap and far better diversified .

HSBC,"Gold Prices Edge Lower as Interest-Rate Concerns Resurface; Fed's John Williams sees inflation rising to the central bank's 2% target, warranting gradual rate increases"," Oct 5, 2017",0,"Gold prices wobbled between small gains and losses Thursday after recent interest-rate concerns that have stalled this year's rally re-emerge.
Gold for December delivery closed down 0.3% at $1,273.20 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices have fallen in six of the past eight sessions and are on track for a fourth straight week of losses--they have shed more than 5% since hitting their highest level in more than a year in early September, in large part because of the Federal Reserve's renewed commitment to raise interest rates again this year.
On Thursday, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams
expressed confidence inflation would rise to the central bank's 2% target, warranting gradual rate increases. With inflation remaining below 2% this year, some investors had been anticipating that the Fed might be more cautious with rate increases, boosting the outlook for gold because the precious metal struggles to compete with yield- bearing assets like Treasurys when borrowing costs rise.
But the central bank recently has renewed its commitment to raise rates four times by the end of next year, a major factor in stalling the rally in gold prices. Investors and analysts are now trying to determine whether the recent pullback is nearing an end as the gold market continues to digest the most recent Fed signals.
""I think it has reacted to Fed comments recently, but I can't help but think to some degree it's already been factored in,"" said James Steel, chief precious-metals analyst at HSBC.
Recent Fed comments have helped the dollar rebound from multiyear lows hit last month, weighing on gold by making the precious metal more expensive for foreign buyers. The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against 16 others, recently was up 0.4% and on track for a fourth-straight week of gains.
Many investors were waiting on Friday's jobs report for the latest reading on the U.S. economy.
Investors were also keeping an eye on Catalonia's move toward independence from Spain, as many favor gold and other haven assets amid geopolitical turbulence. Some have said an escalation in the conflict between the U.S. and North Korea or another unforeseen event might be necessary to induce fear in the market and push investors back toward gold.
""I wouldn't say the market is immune to geopolitical risk, but it's not quite as impressed with it as it was earlier in the year,"" Mr. Steel said.
Among base metals, copper for December delivery rose 3% to $3.0465 a pound--its best day in more than two months. Prices have retreated nearly 5% from their highest level in nearly three years hit early last month, but have bounced back this week amid concerns that Freeport McMoRan Inc.'s deal with the Indonesian government over control of a giant mine in the country could hit snags.

HSBC,"Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, at 10-Year High, Still Has Room to Run; The index closed at its highest level in a decade; it has jumped 29% so far this year"," Oct 6, 2017",1,"
For stock indexes globally, hitting multidecade or record highs this year has been firmly in fashion. But Asia's star performer of 2017 has only now joined the club as Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index topped 2015 highs on Friday , revisiting levels last seen a decade ago.
The index has jumped 29% so far this year, making it one of the best performers among developed-market stock indexes globally and on pace for its biggest gain since 2009. It is now 11% away from a new high.
But at least some of that is the result of a handful of firms having an outsize impact on the index of 50 constituent companies.
Chinese messaging and mobile-game firm Tencent Holdings Ltd. and banking giant HSBC Holdings PLC each make up slightly more than 10% of the Hang Seng Index. Behind them are other financial stocks like China Construction Bank Corp., Industrial &Commercial Bank of China Ltd., AIA Group Ltd. and Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. of China Ltd. Of the six, only China Construction Bank hasn't jumped at least 25% this year.
Analysts, in general, haven't expressed concern about the gains being top-loaded, and more than a few discount the prospect of the city's equities becoming overheated.
""The Hong Kong market does seems attractive in terms of price-to-earnings valuation,"" said Hong Wei Lee, a sales trader at Saxo Bank. Using profit forecasts for 2017, the ratio is currently around 13, slightly above the 10-year average of 12.5. By contrast, the S&P 500's P/E ratio--using earnings predictions for the next 12 months--stands at 18, near its highest reading in more than a decade.
Some say Hong Kong stocks have been held back over the years by persistent investor concerns about China, in particular the high government and corporate debt levels. But those worries aren't new, and there remains a lack of signs that a debt bubble--or a potential one in its property market--is at risk of bursting.
Still, ""that's a major overhang and that's why investors are unwilling"" to push valuations of Hong Kong stocks higher, said Caroline Yu Maurer, head of greater China equities at BNP Paribas Asset Management.
The financial hub is home to Asia's third-largest stock market, with a market cap of $3.96 trillion through September, according to Hong Kong Exchanges &Clearing data on Friday, trailing Tokyo and Shanghai. The value of the 2,060 firms listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange is also the seventh largest world-wide.
The market has also been a hotbed of initial public offerings for more than a decade, with money raised in debuts on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong topping that on any other exchange globally most recently in 2015 and 2016. However, it has fallen to fourth so far in 2017, according to Dealogic data, behind the New York Stock Exchange, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market.
The opening of a second channel through which Chinese investors can buy equities south of the border has helped to bolster Hong Kong stocks this year. Hong Kong exchange data show a majority of companies listed there are based in China.
In November 2014 , the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect went into operation, allowing Chinese investors to buy some Hong Kong-listed stocks for the first time via local brokers. It also allowed those in Hong Kong and abroad to for the first time directly buy Chinese-listed companies, initially just some on the Shanghai exchange. There are limits for both northbound and southbound flows.
That was expanded in December 2016 to connect the exchanges in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, the southern Chinese technology hub where smaller, more speculative stocks are listed.
Chinese buying of Hong Kong-listed shares of mainland companies--known as H-shares--has jumped nearly 50% this year to some 580 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$74.30 billion), according to Socie?te? Ge?ne?rale.
Part of the attraction is that H-shares have a much lower P/E ratio than the companies' A-shares in China. The HSCEI, which tracks H-share performance, trades at 8.8 times anticipated 2017 earnings versus 14.7 for the CSI
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 820 of 1177
300, made up of A-shares in both Shanghai and Shenzhen.
The French investment bank said southbound flows currently make up around 10% of the daily trading volume, but that the buying isn't widespread. The focus last year was on Chinese banks, while investors this year have been concentrating more on consumer and technology-related names. Meanwhile, Chinese property developers in 2017 have logged eye-watering stock gains of as much as 500%.
Then there is Tencent, which has become one of the world's biggest companies by market cap thanks to an 86% stock surge. Its shares outstanding are now valued at $430 billion, nearing the likes of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.
Hong Kong-listed companies have generally had solid earnings growth, with Chinese companies overall logging mid-double-digit increases this year, according to government data. But worries about an anticipated economic slowdown, in part the result of Beijing's efforts to limit countrywide debt levels, have cast some doubt on what firms' future profitability will look like.
There is also the potential fallout from the twice-a-decade Communist Party congress , which begins later this month. Beyond setting up China's leadership for the next five years, policy directions will also be set. Whether they are investor friendly, and if they fuel or suppress stock buying on both sides of the border, could prove key to how stocks in Hong Kong and China fare in the near term.
""Even if there is uncertainty that might affect stocks in the short term, this year seems to be a good year for investment,"" said Castor Pang, head of research at Core Pacific-Yamaichi International.

HSBC,"OECD Indicators Show U.K., Russia as Weak Spots; Global economy is set for strong growth into 2018"," Oct 9, 2017",1,"The global economy is set for continued strong growth into 2018, but the U.K. and Russia are likely to miss out, according to leading indicators released Monday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The Paris-based research body's gauges of future activity, based on data for August, pointed to faster growth in China, Italy and Brazil, while the strong growth experienced over recent months is set to continue in the U.S., the eurozone as a whole and Japan.
The combined output of the Group of 20 leading economies--the countries that account for most of the world's economic activity--was 3.6% higher in the three months through June than in the same period of 2016. That was the strongest expansion since the first three months of 2015.
Among advanced economies, growth was also more evenly balanced, with the U.S. and the eurozone expanding at roughly the same pace, and while Japan still lagged behind, it moved closer.
More recent surveys suggest that pace of growth was maintained in the third quarter. A measure of global activity based on a survey of 18,000 purchasing managers at companies in 40 countries remained at a two-and-a-half year high in September.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 822 of 1177
""This set of data...points to another quarter of robust GDP growth from across the world when official numbers are released over the coming months,"" said James Pomeroy, an economist at HSBC.
The OECD's leading indicators suggest growth is set to continue at that faster and more balanced pace through the early months of next year. The indicators are designed to provide early signals of turning points between the expansion and slowdown of economic activity, and are based on a variety of data series that have a history of anticipating swings in future economic activity. The changes in economic activity signaled by the indicators usually follow six to nine months after they are recorded.
However, the U.K. is likely to lag behind, joined by Russia, the indicators show. Among the Group of Seven largest developed economies, the U.K. had the slowest economic growth in the first half of the year, and that seems likely to continue. To explain its woes, economists point to a jump in inflation that has followed the pound's depreciation in the wake of the June 2016 vote to leave the European Union, as well as high levels of uncertainty about the future relationship between Britain and its main trading partner.
The OECD's composite leading indicator for its 34 members was steady at 100.1 in August. A reading above 100.0 points to growth that is faster than normal.

HSBC,"Now Joining Corporate Women's Groups: Men; Acknowledging their early efforts haven't done enough, some companies involve wider groups of employees"," Oct 10, 2017",1,"Would women and minorities go further in their careers without separate professional networks?
One of the first such corporate groups was founded nearly 50 years ago at Xerox Corp. to boost recruiting of African-Americans after the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Similar groups are now common at many major employers. But while women and minorities have made impressive gains in management since, white men still hold the vast majority of C-suite and next-in-line senior vice president roles--about 80% at last count, according to a new study conducted by LeanIn.Org and McKinsey &Co.
Now some companies, admitting their early efforts haven't done enough, are diminishing the role of stand-alone
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 825 of 1177
affinity groups and diversity chiefs to involve wider groups of employees in their efforts. Other companies are ending officewide antibias training sessions and instead focusing on making staff more directly responsible for progress as part of their everyday business activities.
Consulting giant Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd., which has had longstanding affinity groups and mentoring programs aimed at women and minorities, is shaking things up as it tries to get more employees to care about workplace diversity. Deloitte says that bringing more of the firm's staff into programs and groups like WIN, its 24- year-old initiative for advancing women, will engage dissimilar employees in the shared goal of retaining and promoting women, people of color and others.
Deloitte has opened some formerly women-only programs to men, for example. One fellowship, named for Ellen Gabriel, the first leader of the firm's women's networking initiative, has since 2001 assigned mentors to promising female employees and put them in business-school courses. Shortly after the program's creation, the firm opened the program up to all senior managers, and several men have been awarded the fellowship in recent years. Deloitte men also can now participate in a coaching program for employees taking parental leave.
Mike Preston, chief talent officer, says Deloitte wants to be a place where all types of people feel they can get ahead. Since WIN was founded, men have become more likely to drop out of the company's workforce than women, suggesting Deloitte needs a broad, mixed-gender coalition to ensure an inclusive culture, he says. To do that, he says, there needs to be ""cognitive diversity"" in the room, since people with different experiences and perspectives are likely to pose different solutions to the problems they identify.
Last year, the firm began forming ""inclusion councils"" in a half-dozen pilot offices to organize activities like Deloitte's participation in the annual LGBTQ Pride Parade in Chicago. These councils now involve employees across the firm and may replace the company's eight gender-, sexuality-, race-, ability- and veterans-focused employee networks.
It has been a tricky sell among staff. After reports of the plans came out earlier this year, some Deloitte employees questioned the wisdom of forming the inclusion groups and worried the councils would ""water down the effectiveness"" of the smaller identity-specific groups, according to postings on Fishbowl, an anonymous professional-discussion app used by many in the consulting industry.
Company leaders say there are no firm plans to eliminate those groups, but a spokesman notes that the inclusion councils are drawing more participants at events, and attracting a more diverse mix of employees than the affinity groups do.
New focus
Diversity consultant Avivah Wittenberg-Cox has advised large companies like HSBC Holdings PLC to dissolve their affinity groups or to retrain their focus specifically on more equal representation of women and minorities on leadership teams.
HSBC in 2015 changed the name of its women's network to Balance, to reflect its new mission for a more representative workforce at the bank, says Terri Pearce, U.S. head of talent development.
""The assumption with employee-resource groups is that there is something women or minorities are doing, or something they lack, that makes them less promotable,"" says Ms. Wittenberg-Cox. Reframing diversity efforts as race- or gender-balancing networks shifts accountability to the majority groups, and to managers and executives, she adds.
The vast majority of corporate employers are sticking with women's networks. According to the Lean In and McKinsey report, 83% of the 222 companies in the study sponsor employee resource groups. Around half offer formal mentorship programs for women or individuals in other underrepresented groups.
At Deutsch Inc., employees participate in affinity groups organized across the dozens of ad agencies owned by parent Interpublic Group of Cos. But Deutsch last spring cut its chief diversity officer position, held by 14-year agency veteran Felicia Geiger, who now works for another firm.
Nancy Alley, Deutsch's chief talent officer for North America, says she and other agency leaders have all taken over Ms. Geiger's responsibilities, which include retaining women after family leave and attracting employees of color to
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 826 of 1177

the 800-person company.
The company has set targets to ensure leaders get the message. IPG ties executive compensation to meeting goals such as the number of women and minorities in the management ranks, says Heide Gardner, director for diversity and inclusion at IPG. Some shops like Deutsch have chosen to disperse responsibility to more leaders to better meet their targets for improvement.
Timing the Message
Bucking a similar trend, Atlassian Corp. recently stopped providing its unconscious-bias workshops. This type of training, which identifies the subtle gender and race stereotypes that can influence people's behavior in prejudicial ways, has soared in popularity among corporate employers, particularly in tech.
The Sydney-based workplace software maker had put about 700 employees through a two-hour training session, but some employees felt that concepts like giving effective feedback were ""too removed from their day-to-day work,"" says Aubrey Blanche, the diversity chief, who led most of the sessions.
Instead, Atlassian delivers the message to employees when issues of bias are most likely to arrive--for example, just before job interviews or performance conversations. Alison Huselid, who works on HipChat, Atlassian's group messaging app, says emails sent automatically before interviews with job candidates remind her to apply consistent criteria in evaluating all applicants, regardless of the person's background.
Says Ms. Huselid, ""Having that reminder to pause and reflect on my actions before walking into a room with new people keeps everyone honest.""

HSBC,"HSBC Names John Flint as Chief Executive; Flint, who joined HSBC in 1989, is currently the bank's head of retail banking and wealth management"," Oct 12, 2017",0,"Corrections &Amplifications
HSBC Chairman Mark Tucker left AIA earlier this year. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated he left AIG. (Oct. 12, 2017)
LONDON--HSBC Holdings PLC on Thursday named retail head John Flint as its next chief executive, signaling continuity in the Asia-focused bank's strategy.
Mr. Flint, the preferred pick of outgoing CEO Stuart Gulliver , has been with the bank since joining in 1989 after college and has held key roles in its treasury, asset-management and retail businesses. His current role is CEO of retail banking and wealth management and before that he was Mr. Gulliver's chief of staff for a year.
The naming of a new CEO comes less than two weeks after Chairman Mark Tucker started in his new role . Mr. Tucker, HSBC's first outside chairman since the bank's founding in 1865, was tasked with finding a new CEO after Mr. Gulliver said in March he would retire in 2018. Mr. Flint, 49 years old, will start the role in February.
Even before formally joining the bank's board in September and taking over as chairman this month, Mr. Tucker met with internal and external candidates . He was hired as chairman in March from AIA Group Ltd., where he was CEO.
In an interview, Mr. Tucker said finding the next CEO had been almost his sole project since leaving AIA at the end
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 828 of 1177
of May. He said he was struck by Mr. Flint's ""vision and passion"" for the bank and his record of building high- performing teams.
The mix of having a chairman from outside and an insider CEO was also compelling, Mr. Tucker said.
""We felt he was the best and optimal fit,"" he said.
HSBC, founded in Hong Kong, for decades was focused on expanding its footprint across the world. From 2011 under Mr. Gulliver and former Chairman Douglas Flint--to whom the new CEO isn't related--that focus shifted to cope with a new regulatory environment and tougher economic conditions after the financial crisis. HSBC shut dozens of businesses, exited swathes of the globe and spent billions of dollars on improving its financial crime fighting systems after entering a 2012 deferred prosecution agreement in the U.S. over sanctions and antimoney laundering breaches.
Because of Mr. Tucker's outsider status, analysts had expected the new CEO to be either Mr. Flint or another internal candidate. The bank's share price was unchanged after the announcement.
Mr. Tucker said he, Mr. Flint and the board have been working to set out the bank's next opportunities and priorities, and that some parts of the current strategy could be ""enhanced and accelerated."" More details will come after Mr. Flint starts, he said.
Rejected internal candidates are expected to remain at the bank, at least for the immediate future, he said. Those include head of global banking and markets Samir Assaf, U.K. and European head Antonio Simoes and Finance Director Iain Mackay, according to people familiar with the matter.
""We don't anticipate any immediate changes,"" Mr. Tucker said.

* Quintessential HSBC Insider Takes the Helm
* Analysis: What to Make of HSBC's New Top Team Credit: By Margot Patrick"
HSBC,HSBC: What to Make of Banking Giant's New Top Team; New HSBC Chief Executive John Flint strikes the right match for incoming Chairman Mark Tucker," Oct 12, 2017",0,"John Flint, the next chief executive of HSBC, isn't seen internally as an inspiring leader: Face-to-face he is more likely to talk about the top job in terms that suggest honored duty rather than burning ambition.
But this attitude of service to the cause and his strong background in managing risk are what made him the right person to take over one of the largest bank balance sheets in the world from outgoing chief Stuart Gulliver.
Mark Tucker, the new chairman who recently arrived from insurer AIA and picked Mr. Flint, was never going to perform a true nonexecutive role as a guiding hand for a top executive who set all the strategy and sold the story to investors.
It is more likely that HSBC will be run more like it was under John Bond or Stephen Green in decades past, when
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 830 of 1177
the chairman led the bank and the chief executive was more like a chief operating officer, as Berenberg analysts have suggested.
This fits in many ways. Mr. Tucker is a growth-oriented and hands-on leader. He isn't the sort to take on the work, legal responsibility and public scrutiny of chairing a globally systemically important bank--while being paid a fraction of what he got at AIA--and not have ambitions of leaving a significant personal mark on the business. Also, his experience is mainly in insurance--except for a short spell as chief finance officer of a now defunct U.K. bank and a recent four-year stint on Goldman Sachs's board. He needs an executive who knows how the bank works.
Mr. Flint, a near 30-year veteran of HSBC, has served a full suite of postings across the bank's old empire, but he was also deeply involved in keeping the group's funding and its markets business steady through the 2008 crisis and lately has focused on dragging the retail bank into the digital age.
The new leaders are taking control of a bank that has become a champion in returning capital to shareholders, but which has struggled to find profitable growth. Mr. Flint's job will likely be to make this machine match Mr. Tucker's ambitions, whatever they prove to be.

HSBC,"Quintessential HSBC Insider Takes the Helm; John Flint rose through the bank's ranks to become ""the best and optimal fit"" for the job"," Oct 12, 2017",1,"When a teenage John Flint decided he wanted to become a banker, his high school headmaster wrote to a contact at HSBC Holdings PLC for advice. The reply came back: young Flint should go to college, then enter HSBC's international officers program and prepare to travel the world.
Mr. Flint, now 49, duly did both. On Thursday, he was named by HSBC Chairman Mark Tucker as the bank's new chief executive , replacing Stuart Gulliver, in a vote for continuity at the Asia-focused bank and for Mr. Flint's homegrown values.
To get the top spot, Mr. Flint saw off rivals from inside and outside the bank. Mr. Tucker's outsider status, he is the bank's first externally-hired chairman , meant analysts expected the new CEO to be Mr. Flint or another internal candidate. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Tucker--who started this month, breaking with a century-old tradition of the bank promoting from within--said Mr. Flint is ""the best and optimal fit"" for the job.
Now the head of retail banking and wealth management, Mr. Flint is quintessentially HSBC. After joining its international leadership program out of college, he learned the ropes in bank branches, trading rooms and at the bank's treasury department, in cities including Hong Kong, London, New York and Bangkok. The assignments often had him working alongside Mr. Gulliver, and he was the outgoing CEO's chief of staff for a year before taking his current role in 2013.
Colleagues describe Mr. Flint as sharp, capable and mild-mannered, with some of the same instinct and skill Mr. Gulliver is known for in managing risk and market shocks. Those skills were honed in Asia's financial crisis in the 1990s, when a young Mr. Flint was head of global markets at the bank's Indonesian arm and led it to profits despite the turmoil.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 832 of 1177
As part of HSBC's elite cadre of international officers--later rebranded by the bank as international managers to drop the military connotation--Mr. Flint moved up the ranks and has long been seen as a possible CEO.
He is expected to continue on much the same track as Mr. Gulliver with respect to the bank's strategy . Mr. Tucker said elements of it may be ""enhanced and accelerated."" Efforts already under way include investing more in Asia and rebuilding profitability in the U.S. and Mexico. HSBC made a disastrous foray into the U.S. in the early 2000s, buying a large subprime lender just before the financial crisis. Its business in the country is now a mix of retail branches in key markets such as New York and California, and commercial and investment banking.
Mr. Flint, who as a child lived in Saudi Arabia for several years while his father was a teacher there, has ""vision and passion"" for HSBC, Mr. Tucker said. HSBC said Mr. Flint wasn't available for an interview Thursday.
In a statement, Mr. Flint said he was humbled and excited. He said the bank ""must continue to innovate and accelerate"" its pace of change.
Last year, Mr. Flint traveled with other HSBC executives and research analysts from other banks and brokers on a trip through China's Pearl River Delta region. One analyst who hadn't met him before said he was struck by his down-to-earth manner and self-deprecating humor, which the analyst said was a contrast to Mr. Gulliver. Mr. Gulliver, 58, said in March he would retire in 2018. He also has been at the bank his entire career, and he too came up through the international managers' program.
Analysts say Mr. Flint and Mr. Tucker, who started as chairman Oct. 1, should enjoy some positive momentum as they take their roles. Rising interest rates are boosting returns on HSBC's large deposit base, while much of the heavy lifting around improving compliance systems and exiting loss-making businesses is done now.

The proposed settlements, pending court approval, include no admission of wrongdoing.
In turn, the three banks agreed to cooperate with the plaintiffs--futures traders and others that lost money because of the alleged manipulation--in a 2011 class-action complaint filed against leading financial institutions. The three banks are among those the complaint was filed against.
Banks have paid billions of dollars in penalties to resolve similar criminal and civil cases accusing them of manipulating the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which is calculated based on submissions from a panel of banks.
Libor, which is being phased out, is used to set interest rates in trillions of dollars of financial contracts, including

corporate debt and home mortgages.
According to documents filed Wednesday in Manhattan federal court, the three banks reached the tentative agreements in July, with Deutsche Bank agreeing to pay $80 million, Citi $33.4 million and HSBC $18.5 million. The money would go into a settlement fund to compensate those who lost money because of the alleged manipulation.
A representative for HSBC released a statement saying, ""We are pleased the matter is resolved."" Citi declined to comment. Deutsche Bank couldn't be reached for comment on Thursday evening.

HSBC,"U.S. Companies Pile Into Canadian Bond Market; Low rates, housing fears drive demand for 'Maple bonds'"," Oct 14, 2017",1,"TORONTO--More U.S. companies are going north to borrow money .
Large corporations, including Apple Inc., Walt Disney Co. and McDonald's Corp., have issued almost C$15 billion in Canadian-dollar-denominated bonds this year, the most ever, to take advantage of lower rates and a rise in demand from Canadian investors.
Offerings of Maple bonds--Canadian-dollar-denominated debt issued by non-Canadian issuers--jumped to C$14.9 billion ($11.9 billion) between January and Oct. 13, a record, according to Dealogic. That is almost three times the C$5 billion borrowed for all of 2016 and higher than the previous record of C$14.3 billion set in 2007.
A key reason: Rates for Canadian debt have been lower than in the U.S. for most of this year, allowing companies to save money by borrowing here, said Brad Meiers, head of debt capital markets in Canada for HSBC Securities Inc. The firm worked on a C$1.25 billion offering by Disney earlier this month.
The issuance was Disney's first in Canada and its first outside the U.S. since 2008. The media conglomerate increased the size of the bond from C$750 million after investors lined up for the debt, which pays annual interest of 2.758%. Underwriters ultimately priced the bond 0.81 percentage point higher than the seven-year government bond, cheaper than the 0.84 point they had initially expected.
""Market conditions were attractive for us to issue there,"" said a Disney spokesman.
Disney's offering followed a C$1 billion transaction by McDonald's in late September, and came less than two months after Apple borrowed C$2.5 billion, the largest Maple offering on record. Other issuers this year include AT&T Inc., United Parcel Service Inc., the financing arm of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA and PepsiCo Inc.
AT&T also cited favorable market conditions for its May issuance of Canadian bonds, adding that it sought to diversify its fixed-income investor base.
A UPS spokesman said the interest rate was lower than it would have been on the U.S. side of the transaction. The
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 836 of 1177
company's C$750 million bond carried interest of 2.125% in May, compared with a 2.35% rate UPS is paying on a five-year bond it issued a few days earlier, he said.
Apple, Anheuser-Busch InBev and Pepsi didn't respond to requests for comment.
Also driving the trend are Canadian investors, who are eager to invest in global household names because they need to diversify bond portfolios that lean heavily toward financial issuers, Mr. Meiers said.
The diversification push comes as some investors are worried about Canadian banks' exposure to an overheating housing market and are looking for other places to park their cash.
""If things were to go bad, you're buying the cream of the U.S. crop,"" he said.
Surging house prices in Toronto and Vancouver and rising consumer debt levels are causing concern about the potential for consumer defaults and rising stress on bank balance sheets and the economy. Some analysts estimate the Canadian housing market is overvalued by as much as 60%, and Canada's ratio of household debt to disposable income hit a new high of 167.8% in the second quarter.
""I prefer not to hold Canadian bank credit,"" said Geoff Castle, portfolio manager for Vancouver-based PenderFund Capital. ""There's a lot of unusual stuff in the Canadian real-estate market.""
Mr. Castle sold some U.S.-denominated Disney debt to buy the Disney Maple bonds so he could hold a highly rated U.S. corporate in his local currency. He said the Canadian Disney debt had a slightly higher yield than the U.S. bonds. He also didn't need to hedge his U.S. dollar holdings, removing a cost, he added.
Chris Kresic, head of fixed income at Montreal-based investment management firm Jarislowsky Fraser Ltd., said his firm has been shying away from Canadian corporate bonds in general because it wants higher interest rates from borrowers. The risk of a housing-market crash that would ripple out to the financial sector and the economy as a whole is ""a low probability but a high impact event,"" he said, and he wants more return to justify the risk. ""We don't see a lot of value in the market right now,"" he said.
Another reason why U.S. corporate borrowers have found room in Canada's relatively small debt market is because financial-services issuers, who make up a large proportion of Canadian issuance in any given year, have been ""far less active,"" said Rob Brown, co-head of Canadian debt capital markets for RBC Capital Markets. That is because Canadian banks have been seeking to diversify their own sources of funding as they grow outside Canada, Mr. Brown said.
Canadian bank debt has made up about a third of all corporate offerings in the market this year, down from more than half last year, according to Dealogic.

HSBC,Global Investors Pour Billions Into Hudson Yards in Major Bull Market Bet; Much of the capital behind the mixed-use project on Manhattan's far west side is foreign," Oct 17, 2017",1,"Architect A. Eugene Kohn recalls touring a windswept rail yard on Manhattan's far west side in 2005 and being doubtful about its potential for commercial development.
""Who in the world would want to live over here or work over here,"" Mr. Kohn, whose firm went on to become the master planner of the site, recalled thinking at the time. ""Who is going to put the money up?""
Last month, lead developer Related Cos. took another big step toward answering those questions by announcing it had completed the $3.8 billion financing of 50 Hudson Yards, what will be the development's biggest tower.
The deal increased to $18 billion the total amount of equity and debt raised for the first seven buildings in the project, the first phase of which spans several blocks from West 30th to West 34th streets between 10th and 11th avenues. The anchor tenant for 50 Hudson Yards, asset manager BlackRock Inc., is the latest blue-chip firm to agree to move to the 28-acre development.
Meanwhile, the capital sources for the development that is rising like a new Manhattan mountain range reads like a who's-who list of big-name global financial institutions.
The roster speaks volumes about the sources of capital for megaprojects at what seems to be a late stage in a lengthy bull market in commercial real estate.
For starters, most of the debt and equity capital sources are from overseas. U.S. banks Wells Fargo &Co. and Bank of America Corp. were the lead banks on the construction financing for two of the seven buildings in the first phase of development. But foreign lenders from 11 countries have provided the bulk of the debt. The list includes Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of China Ltd., HSBC Holdings PLC, Credit Agricole SA and Children's Investment Fund of the U.K.
U.S. banks have been more wary than foreign institutions of construction financing since the 2008 financial crisis. ""With all the regulatory burdens on U.S. banks these days, they are very cautious about having too much commercial real estate exposure,"" said Jeff Blau, Related's chief executive.
Foreign banks held $71.6 billion in loans backed by U.S. commercial real estate at the end of the second quarter of this year, according to debt tracker Trepp LLC. That is up from $59.3 billion at the same time in 2016 and $38.3 billion in the second quarter of 2015, Trepp said.
Much of the equity capital for Hudson Yards also is coming from foreign investors, with the exception mostly of Related and some of the project's tenants that have bought their spaces, like Time Warner Inc. and KKR &Co. For example, Related's main partner on the project is Oxford Properties Group, the real estate investor for OMERS, one of Canada's largest municipal pension plans.
The other equity investor in 50 Hudson Yards is the U.S. unit of Mitsui Fudosan Co., one of Japan's largest real
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 841 of 1177
estate companies. Mitsui also provided the lion's share of the equity for 55 Hudson Yards, an office tower under development where tenants will include hedge fund Third Point LLC and law firm Cooley LLP.
The lopsided participation of foreign investors partly reflects the appeal of the U.S. as a haven for investments and of construction projects as a source of higher yield in a low-interest-rate world. Some major financial institutions, like Oxford, have been active investors globally because their home markets are too small to provide enough opportunity.
""You can very quickly grow out of Canada,"" said Blake Hutcheson, Oxford Properties Group's chief executive. ""Most of our growth has been in foreign markets.""
Also, some of the traditional U.S. providers of equity capital in real estate development, like some pension funds, have had less of an appetite for such risk after getting clobbered during the last recession.
""They had to write down a lot of those assets,"" said Chris Ludeman, global president of capital markets at CBRE Group Inc.
Overall, foreign appetite for U.S. commercial property has increased during this decade. In the second quarter of 2017, Canadian investors purchased $4.1 billion of property, up 39% from the same period last year, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics Inc.
Investors outside of North America accounted for close to $50 billion in deals in the first quarter. Those represented 13% of all U.S. transaction volume by midyear 2017, down from 16% one year earlier, but still above the 10% hit at the end of 2014, Real Capital said.
Analysts said the high foreign participation in projects like Hudson Yards could be a sign that a downturn isn't imminent. It shows ""an increased confidence that the business cycle is not likely to roll over and therefore the underlying economics of projects like these remains viable,"" said Larry Hatheway, chief economist of GAM Holding AG, a global asset management firm.
Of course, the high level of recent foreign investment in the U.S. could be a danger sign. Japanese investors infamously purchased Rockefeller Center and other trophy U.S. assets just before the commercial property market collapsed in the recession of the early 1990s.
Still, many don't think a sharp downturn is on the horizon. John Macomber, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School, points out that the market hasn't seen the kinds of surge in leverage or new supply that often precedes a downturn. ""I don't see a huge systemic correction,"" he said in an email.
But he also added: ""Of course, I didn't see 2008 coming either.""

HSBC,Barclays Poaches HSBC Investment Banker for U.K. M&amp;amp;A Role; Omar Faruqui was head of M&amp;amp;A origination at HSBC," Oct 17, 2017",1,"
LONDON--Barclays PLC poached a senior investment banker from HSBC Holdings PLC to co-head its U.K. mergers- and-acquisitions operations.
The British-based bank hired Omar Faruqui to oversee U.K. M&A along with current co-head Derek Shakespeare, according to a memo, as the bank aims to deepen its relationships with U.K. clients.
Based in London, Mr. Faruqui, 42 years old, will assume his new role in January. He brings more than 20 years of investment-banking experience across U.K. corporate-finance and private-equity firms.
The appointment comes as Barclays is involved in some of the most high-profile U.K. cross-border deals, including Vantiv Inc.'s $10 billion-plus cash-and-stock deal to acquire U.K. payments processor Worldpay Group PLC, which was announced in August.
At the same time, the deal-making climate in the U.K. is clouded by the uncertain political and economic fallout from Britain's continuing efforts to split from the European Union. Foreign acquisitions of U.K. companies are down about 15% measured by total value and down about 5% by volume so far this year from the year-earlier period, according to data provider Dealogic.
That potentially highlights concerns by some foreign companies over the economic outlook for the U.K. Similarly, the uncertain political climate may give U.K.-focused companies reason to expand abroad as a way to reduce their reliance on the domestic economy. Supporting that view, outbound deal making measured by value and volume is up significantly so far in 2017, according to Dealogic.
Mr. Faruqui, who left HSBC last week to join Barclays, was head of M&A origination at HSBC, and before that he was European co-head of financial sponsors for the bank. Over the years, the investment banker has worked on several acquisitions and sales for blue-chip U.K. companies, including BAE Systems PLC and Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC.

HSBC,U.K. Regulator Asks Banks to Probe Links With South Africa's Gupta Family; HSBC and Standard Chartered become the latest company's to be drawn into the corruption scandal," Oct 19, 2017",1,"HSBC Holdings PLC and Standard Chartered PLC have been asked by the U.K. financial regulator to review possible business with South Africa's Gupta family, becoming the latest firms to be hit by the fallout from a corruption scandal in Africa's most developed economy.
After a request from U.K. Chancellor Philip Hammond, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority said Thursday it has been in contact with the two banks about their possible dealings with the family and ""will consider carefully further
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 845 of 1177
responses received.""
Standard Chartered in a statement said it shut down some accounts linked to the Guptas in 2014 after an internal investigation. HSBC declined to comment.
South African police and prosecutors have said they are investigating allegations of corruption , including potential kickbacks from international companies, which were brought to light by a flood of emails and other documents that appear to have been obtained from Gupta-controlled companies. The documents have buttressed longstanding suspicions among many South Africans that the powerful business clan leveraged its connection to President Jacob Zuma and other government officials to amass great personal wealth.
The Guptas and Mr. Zuma have denied wrongdoing.
The scandal so far has ensnared international firms including KPMG International, SAP SE and McKinsey &Co., and led to the collapse of the U.K. arm of public relations firm Bell Pottinger over its work for a Gupta holding company. KPMG, which audited Gupta companies for 15 years, last month removed the leadership of its South African branch after an internal probe found it fell short of its own standards during the 15 years it audited Gupta companies.
McKinsey this week said it had disciplined some staff for violating professional standards on a contract with a South African company that was owned by a close associate of the Guptas. SAP said it would release the findings of an internal investigation over alleged kickbacks to a Gutpa company by the end of this month.
KPMG and McKinsey have denied any wrongdoing. SAP's South African office denied the allegations of kickbacks when they first surfaced in media reports in July, but the statement was removed from the company's website days later when the software maker launched the internal probe. A spokesman has declined to comment on why the statement was removed.
Peter Hain, a former cabinet minister and a member of the House of Lords, confirmed on Thursday that he had written to Mr. Hammond last month about allegations by a whistleblower that HSBC and Standard Chartered may have inadvertently served as conduits for corrupt proceeds. An exchange of letters between Mr. Hain and the Treasury became public on Wednesday.
""We take allegations of financial misconduct very seriously, and have passed Lord Hain's letter on to the Financial Conduct Authority and relevant U.K. law enforcement agencies, including the National Crime Agency and Serious Fraud Office, to agree the right action,"" a Treasury spokeswoman said.
The NCA and SFO said they are aware of the matter.
According to documents that appear to have been come from a Gupta company hard drive, and which have been reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, several Standard Chartered accounts were used in 2013 to transfer money between Gupta-controlled companies in South Africa and Dubai to pay for a lavish family wedding.
The documents also show that the funds originated from a government contract to run a dairy farm for poor black South Africans. Standard Chartered has previously said that it closed the accounts used the in transactions in early 2014.
The U.K. regulators request to the banks comes after Indonesia officials last week said they are probing holders of $1.4 billion in trust accounts at Standard Chartered for possible tax due.
The transfer of the accounts in 2015 from Guernsey and Singapore prompted investigations by regulators around the bank's anti-money laundering checks on customers.
Both banks have so-called deferred prosecution agreements with the U.S. over failings in their anti-money laundering controls, among other breaches. As part of the agreements to avoid criminal prosecution, HSBC and Standard Chartered have spent billions of dollars improving their compliance systems.

HSBC,Former HSBC Executive Convicted of Fraud for Front-Running; Mark Johnson found guilty on nine counts related to a $3.5 billion currency trade," Oct 23, 2017",0,"A federal jury in Brooklyn on Monday found a former high-ranking HSBC Holdings PLC executive guilty on charges that he misused information about a client's $3.5 billion currency trade to make millions of dollars for the bank. Mark Johnson, HSBC's former global head of foreign-exchange cash trading, was the first banker to face criminal charges stemming from a U.S. Justice Department probe into foreign exchange rate manipulations. He was convicted on eight counts of wire fraud and one count of wire-fraud conspiracy; he was acquitted on a ninth wire- fraud count.
A lawyer for Mr. Johnson said his legal team planned to appeal the verdict, adding, ""Today an innocent man was convicted.""
""Mark Johnson exploited confidential information provided by a client of the bank to execute trades that were intended to generate millions of dollars in profits for him and the bank at the expense of their client,"" Bridget M. Rohde, the acting U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn, said in a statement. She said the office would continue to prosecute those who ""undermine public confidence in the operation of the financial markets by engaging in fraudulent schemes.""
A sentencing date hasn't been set. The wire fraud charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
A spokesman for HSBC didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Mr. Johnson left HSBC earlier this year.
Mr. Johnson, a British citizen, wasn't accused of rigging exchange rates, the main focus of the broader Justice Department probe.
Instead, he and a colleague, Stuart Scott -- HSBC's former European head of currency trading -- were charged in connection with a practice known as front-running, in which someone with advance knowledge of a major market order buys for their own account, then earns a profit when the larger transaction drives up the price.
Mr. Scott, who left HSBC in 2014, is in the U.K. fighting extradition and wasn't tried alongside Mr. Johnson. A lawyer for Mr. Scott couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
In 2011, HSBC won the bidding to handle the conversion of $3.5 billion worth of dollars into British pounds on behalf of Cairn Energy PLC, an Edinburgh, Scotland-based oil-and-gas company, according to evidence presented at trial.
Prosecutors alleged that the days and hours leading up to the transaction, HSBC traders in London and New York stockpiled millions of pounds in HSBC accounts, at Mr. Johnson's direction. At trial, jurors heard recordings of phone calls that prosecutors said showed Mr. Johnson using coded language to fellow currency traders to set off the buying spree.
When the transaction went through, on Dec. 7, 2011, Messrs. Johnson and Scott executed it in a way that drove up the price of the pound, prosecutors alleged, allowing them to sell HSBC's stockpiled currency at a higher price, while Cairn's proceeds from the exchange shrunk.
""This is not a coincidence -- this is a conspiracy,"" Brian Young, a trial attorney for the Justice Department, said in
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 848 of 1177
the prosecution's closing arguments.
The scheme netted $3 million in trading profits and $5 million in fees for HSBC, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors used cooperating witnesses and the bank's recordings of Mr. Johnson's phone calls to argue he and others had conspired to use the client's confidential information to make money for HSBC and secure larger bonuses. ""This is not how people talk when they are engaged in honest business transactions,"" Mr. Young said in closing arguments.
When Cairn noticed the rising price of the pound that day, another HSBC employee blamed it on purchases by a ""Russian buyer,"" according to evidence presented at trial.
In one phone call recorded by HSBC and played at trial, Mr. Johnson said to Mr. Scott, ""I think we got away with it."" Mr. Johnson's lawyer said the statement reflected concern about the other employee's ""misrepresentation"" about the Russian transaction.
During the trial, lawyers for Mr. Johnson argued that he had been acting in the client's best interest, that prosecutors were trying to criminalize normal currency trading activity and had twisted their client's words to create the illusion of a conspiracy. In closing arguments, defense lawyer John Wing said prosecutors hadn't found ""evidence of anything remotely close to criminal conduct.""
Mr. Johnson, who was arrested at John F. Kennedy airport in New York in July 2016, testified in his own defense at trial, at times seeking to explain comments he made in the recorded calls as jokes or misunderstandings.
Earlier in October, the U.S. Federal Reserve fined HSBC $175 million for failing to adequately supervise its foreign- exchange trading business, citing the alleged conduct by Messrs. Johnson and Scott as examples of the lack of oversight.
In 2012, the bank avoided criminal money-laundering charges by entering into a $1.9 billion settlement and a five- year deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department. In 2014, the bank paid $614 million to settle allegations that it rigged benchmark currency rates.

HSBC,"Bank of Canada Likely on Hold, With Nafta Clouding Rate Outlook; Pessimistic turn on Nafta, new mortgage rules might prompt central bank to take wait-and-see approach"," Oct 24, 2017",1,"Corrections &Amplifications
The risk of Nafta talks disintegrating has gone up appreciably since the fourth round of negotiations ended Oct. 17. An earlier version of the story said the fourth round ended Nov. 17.
OTTAWA--Bank of Canada watchers unanimously believe the central bank will hit pause on Wednesday when it releases its latest policy decision and won't raise rates after two consecutive increases.
There is also less certainty among analysts about the timing of the next rate increase in Canada due to the negative turn in talks to reshape the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Economists from 10 primary dealers of Canadian government securities participated in the The Wall Street Journal survey ahead of the Bank of Canada's rate decision Wednesday. One dealer, HSBC Bank Canada, did not take part in the Journal's survey.
Growth in Canada has slowed after a stellar one-year run. Three straight months of declines in exports and a poor showing in August retail sales has taken the shine off of 12 months of 3.7% growth as of June 30.
Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz has said the central bank would be in a heightened ""data-dependent"" mode , with particular focus on how the economy responds to two rate increases in July and September. On the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund meeting earlier this month, he reiterated his concern over slower expansion.
Nevertheless, prospects in Canada look solid. Growth is forecast at 2% annualized or above in the third and fourth quarters, which analysts expect to place upward pressure on inflation. The labor market continues to churn out new jobs , and wages are beginning to head higher. Finally, the sales outlook among firms remains robust, according to the central bank's latest survey of managers .
Those factors ""warrant at the very least a modestly hawkish tone"" when the central bank issues its rate decision and updated quarterly economic outlook, said analysts at TD Securities.
Other factors, though, are clouding the outlook for Canadian rate forecasters--chief among them the pessimistic tone now prevailing among U.S., Canadian and Mexican officials on Nafta after the latest round of talks.
The risk of Nafta talks disintegrating, and President Donald Trump making good on his threat to withdraw from the deal, has gone up appreciably since the end of negotiations Oct. 17, said Derek Holt, economist at Bank of Nova Scotia. ""What looms over data dependency, that by definition is a scorecard on the economy, is the state of Nafta negotiations, which affects the economy of tomorrow,"" Mr. Holt said of the central bank's outlook.
The fate of Nafta matters greatly to the Canadian economy. Trade with the U.S. accounts for a quarter of the country's economic output, and Nafta's end could cut Canada's gross domestic product by 1% over five to 10 years, according to initial estimates from BMO Capital Markets.
Five economists surveyed by the Journal said they expect the Bank of Canada to raise rates in December, although
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 854 of 1177
at least two of the analysts said their calls were in flux due to Nafta tensions. The other half of surveyed economists said the central bank would wait until the first half of 2018.
""The situation is extraordinarily fluid,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, who believes the next rate increase will be in January.
Also lurking in the Canadian background is a set of changes to mortgage-financing rules .
Sebastien Lavoie, chief economist at Laurentian Bank Securities, said the measures--which will force all potential house buyers to undertake a stress test before a mortgage can be approved--could keep the Bank of Canada on hold through 2018, because their impact will be just as effective as rate increases in terms of cooling down housing activity--especially in Vancouver and Toronto--as well as consumer borrowing. Canadian household debt currently stands at record levels.
Other economists surveyed hold a similar view about how much the new rules will weigh on housing, which during the commodity-price slump was the main driver of Canadian economic growth.

HSBC,China Aims for U.S.-Level Yields in $2 Billion Bond Offering; Bankers have begun marketing China's five- and 10-year bonds to investors; sale could notch a major milestone for a developing economy," Oct 25, 2017",0,"China is returning to international bond markets for the first time in 13 years, with a $2 billion offering of U.S. dollar bonds that will allow the world's second-largest economy to flex its financial muscle in the wake of its just completed Communist Party Congress .
Bankers have begun marketing China's five- and 10-year bonds to investors, primarily in Asia and Europe, and the securities are expected to price on Thursday. China's Ministry of Finance is scheduled to hold a conference call on Wednesday with potential investors to take questions about the deal.
Investors from China and elsewhere are eager to buy the country's sovereign bonds, reflecting the demand that has helped drive booming global debt issuance this year. Potential investors and analysts believe a successful sale could bring yields on the Chinese bonds down to levels close to yields that prevail for the U.S., a major milestone for a developing economy.
""There will be a lot of demand for China's bonds,"" said Ken Hu, chief investment officer of Asian fixed-income investments at Invesco Asset Management in Hong Kong. He said the offering is small by the standards of the U.S. and other major sovereign issuers, likely creating a scarcity value for Chinese securities that will push up their price and reduce yields.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 856 of 1177
Many institutional investors in China are looking to invest in U.S. dollar assets and few see the country carrying any significant default risk, in part because of its relatively low level of external debt.
A successful offering stands to reduce borrowing costs for the state-backed companies that are the backbone of China's economy, analysts and investors said. At the same time, economists warn that Chinese corporate debt levels have risen sharply in recent years and that its state-backed firms are in need of an overhaul to increase efficiency and reduce malinvestment.
China isn't borrowing in U.S. dollars because it needs the money. To the contrary, China routinely runs a trade surplus, exporting more than it imports, and holds some $3 trillion in foreign-currency reserves, including a large hoard of U.S. Treasurys.
The bond sale will be a test of how global investors perceive the country's economic and financial health, following a slowdown in growth and credit-rating downgrades earlier this year. China's economy expanded 6.8% in the third quarter, but its outlook appears hazier due to its reliance on old-line manufacturing industries and rising corporate debt levels.
Still, strong investor demand could push down yields on China's new bonds to less than 0.3 percentage point above comparable Treasury yields, estimate several money managers and analysts. The yield on the five-year U.S. Treasury note was recently 2.027% and the 10-year Treasury yield was 2.406%.
Buyers are expected to include Chinese banks and other domestic investors looking to invest money offshore, as well as sovereign-wealth funds and Western money managers. The securities may be also be added to global bond indexes, making them more attractive to investors.
If the sovereign deal is oversubscribed, Beijing would tout the success as a sign of ""international investors' endorsement of President Xi Jinping's economic visions for China and his leadership,"" said David Loevinger, a managing director of emerging-markets sovereign research at TCW Group Inc.
U.S.-based credit raters Moody's Investors Service and S&P Global lowered China's credit rating to the equivalent of A+ in May and September respectively, ranking China's creditworthiness three or four notches below that of the U.S. Both firms said their downgrades were rooted in what they felt were rising economic and financial risks in China.
The actions drew the ire of China's government, which accused the rating firms of misreading the country's economy. In a statement Tuesday, China's Ministry of Finance said the economy is stable and gathering momentum, and it questioned the credibility of the international rating firms. It said professional investors would make an ""objective judgment"" on China's credit risk. China's new sovereign bonds will be unrated, according to one of the banks involved in the sale.
In recent months, so-called spreads--a measure of how much investors are being compensated for risk--on outstanding U.S. dollar debt issued by Chinese companies has fallen sharply to multiyear lows, according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. In the credit-derivatives market, the cost of buying insurance against a Chinese default has also plunged.
If China's bonds price below sovereign debt issued by South Korea earlier this year, they could set a record for Asian bonds. South Korea in January sold $1 billion in 10-year dollar bonds with a 2.75% coupon. Those securities were priced to yield 0.55 percentage point over comparable Treasurys. Korea has a AA rating from S&P, two notches above China's rating, and its U.S. dollar bonds have the lowest spreads above Treasurys in the region. ""Pricing on [China's] bonds is going to be inflated by demand from Chinese banks...so it's possible they could be even tighter than many market participants expect,"" said Richard Briggs, an analyst with CreditSights in London. China last sold U.S. dollar bonds in 2004; that year, its 5-year debt priced to yield 0.6 percentage point over U.S. Treasurys. At the time, the country's credit rating was lower than what it is now.
Graham Stock, a senior sovereign strategist at London-based BlueBay Asset Management, a fixed-income firm with $57 billion of assets under management, said that the firm is interested in the new bonds, but it ""all depends on the pricing.""
""There's appetite for getting exposure to China, in part because this is a very rare sovereign deal,"" he said. If
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 857 of 1177

spreads come in too tight, however, some foreign investors may decide they aren't being compensated enough and will instead look for other investing opportunities in the region.
China has lined up 10 underwriters, including four foreign banks, to drum up investor interest in the bonds. They include Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings PLC and Standard Chartered PLC, along with the Bank of China and other large Chinese banks.

HSBC,Surprise Capital Demand Signals Uncertainty for Banks; U.K.-focused lender Lloyds hit with extra capital demand as economic risks rise," Oct 25, 2017",1,"
Any investor who thought British banks had escaped demands for higher capital just got a shock.
Lloyds Banking Group has been told by U.K. regulators it must increase its capital ratio by half a percentage point-- or about £1 billion on its current £28 billion target level. The news hit the shares early on Wednesday partly because of worries it could limit the dividend and partly because the bank isn't allowed to reveal why the requirement rose.
Rivals such as Barclays and HSBC could face similar demands on their big U.K. businesses at a time when U.S. competitors are expecting regulation and capital demands to become easier.
Lloyds has long been an investor favorite because of its simple, retail-focused model, high capital base and strong dividend capacity . But the bank is now at the center of concerns about the U.K. economy: extremely rapid consumer credit growth, the economic disruption caused by Brexit and the hit to incomes caused by a weak pound.
One big fear is that U.K. borrowers will struggle when interest rates rise. The Bank of England is expected to lift rates for the first time in a decade next month. That action seems more likely after U.K. economic data on Wednesday showed third-quarter economic growth slightly higher than expected --though still fairly weak at 0.4%. The extra capital demands at Lloyds are on the part of its requirements that the regulator uses to guard against risks it thinks aren't fully captured by a bank's models. These can include interest-rate risks, pensions liabilities, operational risks or concentration risks, for instance.
The raise is targeted specifically at Lloyds, but rival banks may well carry similar risks. Although because Lloyds can't discuss the reason for the increase, that is hard to predict.
All U.K. banks face another extra capital demand when the Bank of England decides what to do about consumer credit. An impromptu stress test in the summer suggested risks were higher than previously thought.
Unlike some rivals, Lloyds has the capital to meet extra demands. It still could finish the year almost half a percentage point ahead of its 13% target common equity ratio even if it pays the 4.5p a share in dividends and buybacks forecast by analysts.
For investors, Lloyds is close to a pure bet on the U.K. economy: the risk is a big rise in bad loans if Britain crashes out of Europe. But, absent disaster, its near 6% dividend yield looks like money in the bank.

HSBC,China Borrows $2 Billion at Rates Just Slightly Above U.S. Treasury Yields; The country's first international debt sale in 13 years saw strong investor demand," Oct 26, 2017",0,"China on Thursday sold $2 billion in bonds at record-low interest rates that were slightly above what the U.S. pays to borrow in the debt markets, a sign of investor confidence in the financial health of the world's second-largest economy.
A surge of investor demand for the country's first U.S. dollar-denominated debt sale in 13 years enabled China to price its five-year bonds to yield 2.196%, or just 0.15 percentage point over comparable U.S. Treasury notes.
The country's 10-year bonds were priced to yield 2.687%, or 0.25 percentage point above Treasury yields. Bankers received over $22 billion in investor orders, and allocated a third of China's bonds to investors in Europe. The bulk went to Asian institutions, and some were purchased by investors in the Americas.
The bond sale, which followed this week's conclusion of China's twice-a-decade Communist Party congress, was carefully managed to achieve an outcome that would send a strong message about China to the global markets. The $2 billion offering was small by the standards of the U.S. and other major sovereign debt issuers. Coupled with China's long absence from the global capital markets, it created a scarcity value for the country's bonds. Many investors, led by Chinese institutions with dollars to invest outside the mainland, were eager to own the securities, and they helped push down yields.
""Investors' view of China is at its strongest point"" in years, said David Loevinger, managing director of Emerging Markets Sovereign Research at TCW Group, referring to what he called ""super-tight spreads"" on the new bonds. With China's new leadership in place and U.S. President Donald Trump preparing to visit Beijing, ""China wants to show that it is an equal power to the U.S.,"" Mr. Loevinger added.
China had said it has no significant need for external financing. The country runs a large trade surplus and has over $3 trillion in foreign-currency reserves, including a big stash of U.S. Treasurys.
The main goal of the bond sale was to create low interest-rate benchmarks that Chinese state-owned enterprises and private corporations, which are more regular issuers of offshore debt, can reference when tapping the global bond markets for their funding needs.
China had tapped 10 large banks, including Bank of China Ltd., Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings PLC, to help drum up buyers for its sovereign bonds. The securities were marketed primarily to investors in Asia and Europe.
Earlier Thursday, banks circulated price guidance for the securities, launching the five-year bond sale at suggested yields of 0.3 to 0.4 percentage point above Treasurys. They offered China's 10-year bonds at 0.4 to 0.5 percentage point over the U.S. yield benchmark. By the afternoon in Asia, strong investor demand led bankers to move their yield guidance closer to Treasury yields.
It is a common strategy for bankers to initially offer more generous yields and later sell the debt at much lower yields to demonstrate that strong investor demand enabled issuers to pay less in borrowing costs.

and S&P Global this year. Both grade the country the equivalent of an A+ rating, which is several notches below their rating on the U.S., and the raters have pointed to what they consider rising economic and financial risks in China.
China's Finance Ministry has pushed back hard against the raters' assessments, arguing its economy is stable and gathering momentum. It proceeded with its bond sale without getting the securities rated, and in a statement this week said the international raters have misread China's economic development and growth potential. It said investors in the international debt markets would make an objective assessment of China's creditworthiness.
In marketing China's bonds earlier this week, investment bankers provided several 10-year yield benchmarks that investors could use to compare the country's relative risk. The comparisons included 10-year U.S. dollar bonds issued by Israel in September 2016, which were recently yielding 0.41 percentage point above U.S. Treasurys. Israel has the same credit rating as China.
Another benchmark for comparison was German government-backed development bank KfW Group, which in April 2015 issued $3 billion in U.S. dollar bonds. Those securities recently yielded 0.05 percentage point over 10-year U.S. Treasurys. Germany has triple-A credit ratings from the major ratings firms.
Some analysts found the comparisons surprising, because they were made against U.S. dollar bonds from a different region. China's bonds are ""turning out to be unconventional in every way,"" said Anne Zhang, executive director for fixed income, forex and commodities in Asia at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.
A two-hour investor meeting on Wednesday at Hong Kong's Monetary Authority drew dozens of investors in the city while many from overseas dialed in by phone. At the meeting, Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan said he intends to pass a bill that would provide a tax exemption for investors who purchase the bonds. A senior official from China's Finance Ministry also took questions from investors, according to an attendee.
The bond sale was engineered to be successful, and ""proves a point to the world"" that China can sell its debt cheaply without credit ratings, said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief economist for the Asia Pacific at Natixis.
Some investors remain skeptical about China's outlook. ""China hasn't slayed its demons of too much leverage and too much dependence on the property market,"" said Mr. Loevinger of TCW. ""But those risks seem to have been pushed aside for the time being.""
China is the latest among dozens of developing countries that have tapped the international bond market, where investors' thirst for higher yields has sparked record issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated debt this year. Earlier Thursday, Mongolia, which has a ""junk"" credit rating, raised $800 million by selling 5.5-year U.S. dollar bonds that pay 5.625% in annual interest. The country had originally set out to raise $650 million, but upped the issue size after seeing strong investor demand.

HSBC,China Borrows $2 Billion at Rates Just Slightly Above U.S. Treasury Yields; The country's first international debt sale in 13 years draws strong investor demand," Oct 27, 2017",0,"China sold $2 billion in bonds at record-low interest rates that were slightly above what the U.S. pays to borrow in the debt markets, a sign of investors' confidence in the financial health of the world's second-largest economy.
A surge of investor demand for the country's first U.S. dollar-denominated debt sale in 13 years enabled China to price its five-year bonds to yield 2.196%, or just 0.15 percentage point over comparable U.S. Treasury notes at the time of the pricing.
The country's 10-year bonds were priced to yield 2.687%, or 0.25 percentage point above Treasury yields. Bankers received more than $20 billion in investor orders from investors and allocated a third of China's bonds to investors in Europe. The bulk went to Asian institutions, and some were purchased by investors in the Americas.
The bond sale, which followed this week's conclusion of China's twice-a-decade Communist Party congress, was carefully managed to achieve an outcome that would send a strong message about China to the global markets.
The $2 billion offering was small by the standards of the U.S. and other major sovereign-debt issuers. Coupled with China's long absence from the global capital markets, it created a scarcity value for the country's bonds. Many investors, led by Chinese institutions with dollars to invest outside the mainland, were eager to own the securities, and they helped push down yields, which move inversely to prices.
""Investors' view of China is at its strongest point"" in years, said David Loevinger, managing director of Emerging Markets Sovereign Research at TCW Group, referring to what he called ""super-tight spreads"" on the new bonds.

China had tapped 10 large banks, including Bank of China Ltd., Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings PLC, to help drum up buyers for its sovereign bonds. The securities were marketed primarily to investors in Asia and Europe.
Some investors were turned away by the meager yields offered by China. Edwin Gutierrez, head of emerging- market sovereign debt at Aberdeen Standard Investment, which has $758 billion of assets under management, said he passed on the China deal.
""This is not targeted for me,"" Mr. Gutierrez said, noting that the average yield on emerging-market bonds is in excess of 5%. If he bought the Chinese bond, it would be ""an incredible yield give-up for global emerging-market managers like me,"" he said.
Earlier Thursday, banks circulated price guidance for the securities, launching the five-year bond sale at suggested

HSBC,"Spanish Stocks, Bonds Sell Off After Catalan Parliament Declares Independence; Move promises further turmoil for the country's markets"," Oct 27, 2017",1,"
Investors dumped Spanish stocks and bonds after the region of Catalonia declared independence on Friday , in a move that promises further turmoil for the country's markets.
Spain's IBEX-35 stock-market index dropped 1.4% on the day, while the broader Stoxx Europe 600 gained 0.3%, after the Catalan parliament voted to declare an independent Catalan Republic.
Banco de Sabadell SA and CaixaBank SA, two banks with a strong presence in Catalonia, were among the biggest decliners, losing 4.7% and 3.1% respectively.
Investors also sold Spanish bonds, which so far have been hit less than stocks by the crisis, which intensified after Catalan officials staged an unauthorized referendum on independence on Oct. 1.
Yields on 10-year Spanish government debt rose Friday to 1.574% from 1.558% the previous day. Yields on bonds issued by the Catalan government maturing next year rose to 2.493% from 2.313% Thursday. Bond yields move opposite to prices.
""In the near term, the volatility will probably remain because the issue still needs to settle,"" said Nicola Mai, a sovereign-credit analyst at Pacific Investment Management Co. He the key risk to watch for would be ""significant civil unrest.""
But, he added, ""I view it as a tail risk.""

The euro increased its losses after the Catalan parliament's vote, having already opened lower following the European Central Bank's commitment Thursday to gradually reduce monetary stimulus . The currency was trading down 0.29% at $1.16 in late afternoon trading in Europe.
Friday's vote by the Catalan parliament came as Spain's government pushed ahead with an attempt to take over regional institutions that had been autonomous, such as the local police force.
Analysts say Spain and the European Union are unlikely to recognize Catalan independence, but Madrid's attempts to take over the regional government could spark social unrest. The market selloff reflects fears that uncertainty will be harmful for the Spanish economy, investors say.
""It reflects a negative impact on growth for one of the economies that was leading Europe and could now be affected,"" said Adrien Pichoud, chief economist at SYZ Asset Management, which has dumped Spanish stocks and bonds since the Catalan crisis escalated in September.
Until July, Spain's IBEX-35 index was outperforming benchmark indexes in Italy, France and Germany on a total return basis. Now, the stocks are the worst performers in this group.
The premium demanded by investors to hold Spanish bonds instead of German 10-year debt--a widely used measure of credit risk--also edged up Friday, but it remains narrow by historical standards.
Chris Iggo, chief investment officer of fixed income at AXA Investment Managers, said the ECB's bond-buying program is still providing support to Spanish bonds.
""If the ECB wasn't still buying, who knows where the spread could go,"" he said.
Still, Mr. Iggo said he believes that ""the reaction so far suggests that people don't think this can meaningfully go very far, because they see the Catalan government having very little power here.""
Bonds issued by Spanish banks were less affected than their shares. A [euro]2.5 billion covered bond maturing in 2021, issued by CaixaBank, yielded just above 0% on Friday afternoon, a decline from Thursday. According to HSBC analysis, 28.7% of CaixaBank's cover pool of mortgages is based in Catalonia.
There were also some moves that seemed anomalous to events. Biotech firm Grifols SA, one of the few listed Catalan companies that has so far refused to move its headquarters out of the restive region, was the top performer in the IBEX-35, rising 1%.

HSBC,U.S. Investigating Foreign-Exchange Trading at Wells Fargo; Move follows the firing of four foreign-exchange bankers amid an internal investigation," Oct 27, 2017",1,"
Federal prosecutors are investigating foreign-exchange trading at Wells Fargo &Co. and have subpoenaed information from the firm, which recently fired bankers in that business, according to people familiar with the matter.
The investigation, which is in the early stages, is being conducted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, some of the people said. The office subpoenaed information in recent days, according to some of the people. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Wells Fargo had fired four foreign-exchange bankers amid an internal investigation.
Issues within the bank's foreign-exchange operation revolve around a single trade and ensuing dispute with one client, Restaurant Brands International Inc., the people said. This company is the owner of Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, and--like Wells Fargo--counts Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. as a major shareholder.
In a statement, Wells Fargo said it ""learned of an issue associated with a foreign-exchange transaction for a single client. The matter was reviewed, the client was promptly notified regarding the issue, and Wells Fargo leadership took steps to hold accountable the individuals who were involved. Wells Fargo remains committed to our foreign- exchange business, meeting our clients' financial needs in an ethical way, and ensuring ongoing review of this and all business operations.""
A spokesman for the Northern District didn't respond to requests for comment.
Investigations into Wells Fargo's foreign-exchange business, which is housed within its investment bank, are separate from sales-practices issues that rocked the bank more than a year ago . But they come at a sensitive time for the bank: Wells Fargo remains under political and regulatory pressure because of the sales scandal, which remains under separate investigation by the Justice Department and other agencies. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District also is involved in one of those investigations.
The foreign-exchange issue revolves around a trade made within the past three years that included positions running into the billions of dollars for Restaurant Brands, the people said. The trade resulted in a loss to Restaurant Brands, the people added, which led to a dispute between it and the bank.
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 870 of 1177
Wells Fargo is planning to refund Restaurant Brands hundreds of thousands of dollars because of the loss, one of the people familiar with the matter said.
In addition to the Justice Department, potential issues around the Wells Fargo trade also are being examined by the Federal Reserve, some of the people said.
The bank recently fired the four foreign-exchange bankers for cause and launched an internal investigation, according to people familiar with the matter. Those fired were Simon Fowles, recently head of foreign-exchange trading; Bob Gotelli, recently head of foreign-exchange sales; Jed Guenther, recently a regional head of foreign exchange; and Michael Schaufler, chief spot dealer, The Wall Street Journal has previously reported.
A spokeswoman for the bank has confirmed that these individuals no longer work for Wells Fargo. The bankers didn't respond to requests for comment.
Federal prosecutors are looking into the sequencing of the trade in question and whether it could have involved so- called front-running, some of the people familiar with the matter said. Front-running typically involves a trader jumping ahead of a client's order, buying or selling for their own account to profit when the larger transaction moves a price.
In its statement, Wells Fargo said, ""The departure of these employees was not related to issues involving market collusion, front-running or market manipulation.""
Potential front-running is often difficult to gauge given the ambiguity around pre-hedging strategies in currency trading. Typically a bank must purchase currency as part of a trade and price it differently than it would, say, a stock purchase. In the latter case, the customer is typically charged what the bank pays a broker dealer for the trade.
But with currency trading there are ambiguities around how bankers phrase the pricing to the customer and how the trade is executed.
Earlier this week, a federal jury in Brooklyn found a former high-ranking HSBC Holdings PLC executive guilty on charges that he misused information about a client's $3.5 billion currency trade to make millions of dollars for the bank.
Wells Fargo's investment-banking, securities and markets division, known as Wells Fargo Securities, is a fraction of the size of its U.S. big-bank peers, as is its foreign-exchange business. The bank doesn't break out financial results or metrics for that group or its foreign-exchange business.

HSBC,"U.S. Stocks Slide to Start a Busy Week; Analyst downgrades weigh on shares of retailers, which have come under pressure this year"," Oct 30, 2017",1,"
* Major U.S. stock indexes fall
* Retail stocks slide
* Treasury yields move lower
Shares of retailers and health-care companies slipped Monday following a slew of analysts' stock downgrades.
The declines weighed on major U.S. stock indexes at the start of a busy week that was set to include another round of earnings results, the monthly U.S. jobs report and policy decisions from central banks around the world.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 85.45 points, or 0.4%, to 23348.74. The S&P 500 fell 8.24 points, or 0.3%, to 2572.83 and the Nasdaq Composite inched down 2.3 points, or less than 0.1%, to 6698.96.
Shares of retailers, which have come under pressure this year as foot traffic has declined at many brick-and-mortar stores, took a fresh hit Monday.
J.C. Penney slid 25 cents, or 8%, to $2.87 and Macy's lost 85 cents, or 4.3%, to 18.84 after Citigroup analysts changed their rating for both stocks to sell from neutral. Nordstrom and Kohl's lost more than 2% apiece.

Declines in health-care stocks also pulled major stock indexes lower.
Merck &Co. fell 3.53, or 6.1%, to 54.71 after Morgan Stanley and Barclays, among other firms, cut their ratings for the drugmaker's stock. The day's moves extended losses from Friday, when the company posted a third-quarter loss and said the lost sales and costs of responding to a June cyberattack would likely weigh on fourth-quarter results, too.
Meanwhile, government bonds rose, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note to 2.374% from 2.426% Friday. Yields fall as bond prices rise.
Bond yields have swung in recent weeks as investors have watched for signs of progress on a Republican tax plan , as well as hints around whom President Donald Trump will nominate to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve.
""What investors are trying to figure out is how much the tax reform plan is already baked into the market,"" said Dave Donabedian, chief investment officer at CIBC Atlantic Trust.
A failure by the Republicans to pass a tax plan could pressure stocks in the short term, Mr. Donabedian said, although steady economic growth should continue to support gains over the longer term. ""We've had a great mix of economic growth and low inflation, and the fact that it's happening outside of the U.S. as well is supportive,"" he said.
Elsewhere, Spain's IBEX 35 index jumped 2.4%, recovering from losses Friday, as investors reassessed the political climate in the country.
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy set new elections in Catalonia for Dec. 21 and moved to impose direct rule after separatist lawmakers in Catalonia's parliament voted in favor of independence, in breach of Spain's constitution.
""This is not going to end in an independent state and the short period of time before regional elections should help offset any knock to confidence that may slow growth,"" said Andrew Mulliner, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors. The asset management group has been adding to holdings in Spain over the past week, he said, pointing to the country's solid growth.
Moves elsewhere were muted. The Stoxx Europe 600 edged up 0.1% as gains in Spanish companies helped offset post-earnings declines in index heavyweight HSBC Holdings.
Japan's Nikkei Stock Average ended flat after seven straight weekly gains, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 closed up 0.3%.

HSBC,HSBC Swings to Profit as Pivot to Asia Pays Off; Revenue in Asia rises from increased customer borrowing and growing deposit base," Oct 30, 2017",0,"HSBC Holdings PLC swung to a third-quarter net profit and said increased investment in its Asia business was paying off, with revenue there rising.
The U.K. banking company on Monday posted a $3.24 billion net profit for the period versus a net loss of $204 million in the comparable quarter of 2016, as revenue rose 36% to $12.98 billion. On a pretax basis, the bank's profit surged to $4.62 billion from $843 million.
Executives said there was strong growth in lending in Hong Kong and mainland China, including in the Pearl River Delta area where the bank has been staking out turf. Finance head Iain Mackay said loans and deposits there had grown to over $1 billion from ""a very small base.""
He said HSBC's new securities venture in China, underwriting stocks and bonds and advising on mergers, would contribute to its growing mainland business, albeit slowly and over time. The securities venture, which is the first majority-owned by a foreign bank, got the go-ahead from authorities in June.
HSBC Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver said the bank's international network continued to deliver strong growth in the third quarter, and its pivot to Asia was driving higher returns and lending growth, particularly in Hong Kong.
Asia loans and advances rose 17% for the three months to Sept. 30, compared with the third quarter of 2016. Asia customer deposits were $10.1 billion higher than at June 30. Across the bank, revenue on retail deposits rose to $1.61 billion, from $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2016.
The third-quarter results come after HSBC said in late July that net profit rose 57% to $3.87 billion for the second quarter, amid improving loan growth and rising contribution from its other businesses. The profit growth has helped the bank accrue surplus capital and it has been returning some of it to shareholders by buying back shares.
In an interview, Mr. Mackay said the bank still had roughly $10 billion of extra capital tied up in its subsidiaries, including about $6 billion in the U.S. He said further buybacks would be considered, ""when the time is appropriate."" Local regulators must approve capital moving up to the group level.
HSBC was founded in Hong Kong in 1865 and is headquartered in London. It considers Hong Kong and the U.K. to be its two home markets.

Mr. Gulliver heralded a ""pivot to Asia"" in June 2015 as one of the finishing touches to the bank's overhaul after the financial crisis. During his time as CEO, starting in 2011, HSBC exited dozens of businesses and withdrew from parts of the globe. Mr. Gulliver said at the time that HSBC would aim to repeat its historic growth in Hong Kong in China's emerging urban centers.
On Monday, Mr. Gulliver said HSBC had hit most of the targets he set out in 2015 and that he aimed to have them all done when he retires from the bank on Feb. 20, 2018.
Mr. Gulliver announced his resignation this year. A new chairman, Mark Tucker, started in October and named retail head John Flint as Mr. Gulliver's successor.
One of the tasks set by Mr. Gulliver was to significantly improve HSBC's processes and controls around preventing financial crime. Raising its standards is a key condition of a five-year deferred prosecution agreement the bank entered in 2012 with the U.S. Justice Department, while paying $1.9 billion in a settlement over money-laundering allegations.
HSBC is awaiting news from the Justice Department on whether the deferred prosecution agreement will expire or be extended.

HSBC,HSBC Finally Finds a Taste of Growth in China; Slow and steady focus on Pearl River Delta is producing loan growth at last," Oct 30, 2017",1,"HSBC has been promising growth in China and now it seems to have found some with a chunky slug of extra lending in the southern Chinese province near its Hong Kong stronghold.
For investors in one of the world's largest banks, the question is whether this third-quarter result begins a sustainable trend to create the long-term earnings growth that will feed future dividends.
HSBC has been cutting capital from weaker businesses to invest in better ones for the past few years, but a struggle to find profitable growth means the bank has released more capital than it has reinvested . That has
funded generous payouts to shareholders, which is great while it lasts, but leaves a nagging question as to what future profits--and dividends--will look like.
The $1.1 billion of new loans in Guangdong province that HSBC highlighted in the third quarter may not seem like
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 878 of 1177
much compared with total lending growth of $25 billion. But more than half that total growth is due to currency moves. In fact these southern China loans were a respectable portion of the Asia-wide net loan growth of $8.6 billion, much of which is in Hong-Kong mortgages. And they were equivalent to the net loan growth of $1.2 billion in Europe, including the U.K.
The new business in Guangdong, centered on the Pearl River region, home to the manufacturing-hub of Shenzhen, is split between wealthier retail and smaller business clients. The retail side is a mortgage business with a bit of credit-card growth, a prudent approach as too-rapid growth in unsecured consumer lending usually ends in tears.
The business lending side is in predominantly shorter-term loans, such as trade finance, which is much quicker to build up and simple to wind down if risks increase, but is often relatively low return and can be quickly recaptured by cheaper competitors.
HSBC is pursuing a slow and steady approach to southern China, which investors ought to be happy with given the risks involved in rampant property price growth and the high indebtedness across China more broadly. It will take several quarters to see whether it can keep adding to its book in a similar way.
But two-years after HSBC put a big spotlight on the Pearl River Delta's potential, investors are finally getting a taste of it."

HSBC,Eurozone Economy Slows Slightly as Inflation Target Remains Elusive; There is a missing ingredient that is likely to limit the pace of growth and inflation: big wage increases," Oct 31, 2017",1,"The eurozone economy slowed slightly in the three months through September, while the annual rate of inflation fell, a combination that will likely reinforce the European Central Bank's caution as it starts to scale down its stimulus measures .
Despite the third-quarter deceleration, the eurozone economy appears on course for its strongest year since 2007. With the U.S. economy also picking up, that should nudge the global economy toward its fastest expansion since 2014.
But there is a missing ingredient in
both expansions that is likely to limit their pace and how quickly inflation rises: big wage increases.
The European Union's statistics agency said Tuesday the eurozone's gross domestic product--a broad measure of the goods and services produced by an economy--grew at an annualized rate of 2.4% in the three months to September, a slowdown from the 2.6% growth rate recorded in the three months through June.
Compared with the same period a year earlier, GDP was up by 2.5%, its fastest rise since the start of 2011.
ECB President Mario Draghi cited Thursday an ""increasingly robust and broad-based"" recovery as justification for his decision to cut the monthly rate of bond purchases to [euro]30 billion ($35 billion) from [euro]60 billion at the start of 2018.
That was seen as a first step toward removing the massive support provided to the economy by policy makers since mid-2014, although Mr. Draghi stressed the need for ""patience, persistence and prudence"" and made it clear the bond-buying program--known as quantitative easing--could be extended again beyond its tentatively scheduled termination in September 2018.

HSBC,"Beating Rival Banks in Tough Times Bodes Well for BNP Paribas; French bank's weak bond trading haunts investors, but it still outperformed peers"," Oct 31, 2017",0,"Something in BNP Paribas's third-quarter numbers gave investors a touch of the heebie-jeebies Tuesday, but compare the French bank to its peers and there is little reason to take fright.
Shares in Europe's second-biggest bank by assets lost about 3.5% in morning trading, but with the continent's economy and lending on firmer ground, this reaction seems overdone .
Bond and currency trading has been a tough business across U.S. and European banks in 2017 and so it was for BNP, too, where the drop in this activity dragged down revenues for its corporate and investment bank as a whole.
However, BNP's 22% fall in third-quarter bond trading revenue in dollar terms was bang in line with the average for U.S. peers versus the same period a year ago--and much better than the 30%-plus declines suffered at Barclays, Deutsche Bank and UBS.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 885 of 1177
Its equities trading business also performed well, adding revenues in funding hedge fund trades where banks with cheap financing costs such as BNP and HSBC seem to have been gaining ground from more expensive peers such as Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse.
This wasn't enough to stop the corporate and investment bank reporting overall revenues down 8.5% and much weaker than analysts expected. That disappointment added to pressure on retail and commercial banking in Europe where higher lending volumes weren't enough to make up for the continuing squeeze on interest margins.
The key to easing the twin pressures of poor bond trading activity and tight interest margins is central bank interest rate policy, especially in Europe.
The European Central Bank's decision to trim its bond-buying program next year is a small step in the right direction. The other positive sign is growing demand for corporate loans in the big eurozone countries, which is being driven by higher capital expenditure, according to Morgan Stanley, supporting future economic growth.
At the same time, BNP's cost-cutting program is supporting profits as revenues stutter and its annualized return on shareholders equity of 8.4% so far in 2017 is better than many European peers.

HSBC,Eurozone Economy Slows Slightly as Inflation Target Remains Elusive; There is a missing ingredient that is likely to limit the pace of growth and inflation: big wage increases," Nov 1, 2017",0,"The eurozone economy slowed slightly in the three months through September, while the annual rate of inflation fell, a combination that will likely reinforce the European Central Bank's caution as it starts to scale down its stimulus measures .

With the U.S. economy also picking up, that should nudge the global economy toward its fastest expansion since 2014.
But there is a missing ingredient in
both expansions that is likely to limit their pace and how quickly inflation rises: big wage increases.
The European Union's statistics agency said Tuesday the eurozone's gross domestic product--a broad measure of the goods and services produced by an economy--grew at an annualized rate of 2.4% in the three months to September, a slowdown from the 2.6% growth rate recorded in the three months through June.
Compared with the same period a year earlier, GDP was up by 2.5%, its fastest rise since the start of 2011.
ECB President Mario Draghi cited Thursday an ""increasingly robust and broad-based"" recovery as justification for his decision to cut the monthly rate of bond purchases to [euro]30 billion ($35 billion) from [euro]60 billion at the start of 2018.
That was seen as a first step toward removing the massive support provided to the economy by policy makers since mid-2014, although Mr. Draghi stressed the need for ""patience, persistence and prudence"" and made it clear the bond-buying program--known as quantitative easing--could be extended again beyond its tentatively scheduled termination in September 2018.
The main reason for that caution is that there have yet to be ""convincing signs"" inflation is heading sustainably higher. That was confirmed by other figures from Eurostat on Tuesday showing consumer prices were 1.4% higher in October than a year earlier, having increased by 1.5% in September.

HSBC,Fortress Hires Deutsche Hedge Fund Team Amid Legal Complaint; Two team members are accused of engaging in a 'nefarious scheme'," Nov 3, 2017",1,"Fortress Investment Group LLC has hired a team of hedge-fund managers from Deutsche Bank AG, two of whom are the subject of a complaint from another U.S. hedge fund.
London-based Magnus Lorrain-Smith, who has worked at Deutsche for nearly 25 years, Ben Keefe and New York- based Apostolos Peristeris left Deutsche in October and are set to join Fortress, the New York-based investment manager with $72.4 billion in assets, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Mr. Lorrain-Smith ran, with help from Messrs. Keefe and Peristeris, the $1 billion Aggregator fund at Deutsche. It buys stakes in hedge funds, private equity and other funds in the secondary market, in which sellers can unload stakes in illiquid funds to buyers hoping to pick up assets at a discount.
Their move comes amid a legal battle involving Deutsche's Alternative Asset Management (UK) Limited unit and Messrs. Keefe and Lorrain-Smith. They are among defendants in the case, which has been brought by Yorkville Advisors.
In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Newark, N.J. in late September and amended this week, Yorkville accuses the defendants of fraud and says they engaged in a ""nefarious scheme"" and made ""false"" statements to Yorkville. The defendants have so far not responded in court.
Mr. Keefe didn't respond to a request for comment, while Mr. Lorrain-Smith declined to comment. Mr. Peristeris also declined to comment.
Having built up a large stake in Yorkville's main fund, Deutsche, Mr. Keefe and Mr. Lorrain-Smith, with help from the other defendants, ""misused this position"" to get confidential information, the complaint alleges. It claims this information was then used ""to interfere with, target and raid"" Yorkville's assets.

The case centers on an Australian mining company, Compass Resources, which was controlled by Yorkville. The defendants' plan was to ""gain control of CMR's [Compass's] board and use it to improperly drive the company into administration,"" the complaint says. ""Once CMR was in administration, defendants would wipe out Yorkville's interest and pick off CMR's assets for themselves at bargain prices.""
Yorkville itself, which once ran $1 billion in assets, is subject to legal action by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which has charged it with overvaluing assets and exaggerating returns. Yorkville didn't respond to a request for comment.
Tim Gascoigne, Deutsche Asset Management's head of hedge fund advisory and former global head of portfolio management at HSBC Alternative Investments, is taking over management of the Aggregator fund, said a person familiar with the matter.

HSBC,"Saudi Princes, Former Ministers Arrested in Apparent Power Consolidation; Targeting of senior princes and sitting cabinet ministers represents escalation of campaign of arrests launched by Saudi leadership"," Nov 5, 2017",1,"
Saudi authorities on Saturday carried out a new wave of arrests, targeting royals and cabinet ministers in a crackdown against alleged corruption that comes as the Saudi leadership is seeking to consolidate power during a period of political transition.
Billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, a prominent member of Saudi Arabia's royal family and one of the world's wealthiest men, was among at least 10 princes and more than two dozen current and former ministers detained by Saudi authorities on Saturday night, according to people familiar with the matter.
Mr. al-Waleed is a top investor in Apple Inc. and Twitter Inc. He faces charges of money laundering, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The targeting of senior princes like Mr. al-Waleed and of sitting cabinet ministers represents an escalation of a campaign of arrests launched by the Saudi leadership in recent months. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman--
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 892 of 1177
elevated to heir apparent after his predecessor was deposed this summer --is consolidating power before his octogenarian father, King Salman, is expected to abdicate either later this year or early next year, people familiar with the matter said.
Mr. al-Waleed has long been one of Saudi Arabia's most prominent business voices, but he hadn't been seen as a major player in domestic politics. His father, Talal bin Abdulaziz al Saud, however, has previously opposed Prince Mohammed's rise to power.
Over the years Mr. Alwaleed was a key backer of Rupert Murdoch's media empire, but he is no longer a significant shareholder in Wall Street Journal parent News Corp or 21st Century Fox Inc. after selling shares in recent years.
Representatives of the Saudi government and a spokeswoman for Mr. al-Waleed didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
Two other prominent Saudi government officials were also detained, the people familiar with the matter said: Adel Fakieh, the economy minister, and Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, the head of the National Guard, one of three main branches of Saudi Arabia's security forces. Both face charges of corruption.
King Salman on Saturday night issued royal orders firing the two men, without elaborating. Prince Mohammed has previously said he would go after graft at the highest level.
In September, the government arrested dozens of clerics and other public figures, some of whom had opposed Prince Mohammed's moves toward liberalization. The government also warned Saudis that it wouldn't tolerate criticism of its hard-line stance toward neighboring Qatar , with which it severed ties in June.
At the time, Saudi officials said the government was targeting people it suspected were involved in a nascent plot against the government .
Saturday's arrests were carried out by a newly established anticorruption agency headed by the crown prince. The agency, formed on Saturday by a decree issued by King Salman, has far-reaching authority in cases of suspected corruption involving public funds, including the power to issue arrest warrants, to impose travel restrictions and to freeze assets.
""Laws will be applied firmly on everyone who touched public money and didn't protect it or embezzled it, or abused their power and influence,"" King Salman's order said. ""This will be applied on those big and small, and we will fear no one.""
The anticorruption committee marks a new effort to stamp out unscrupulous dealings in a country where the line between government money and the royal family isn't always clear.
The crackdown comes as Saudi Arabia moves forward with an economic liberalization plan centered on the initial public offering of a piece of the state energy firm , Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the largest oil producer in the world. The IPO could generate as much as $100 billion, making Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund the largest in the world and helping the kingdom invest in other areas beyond oil--a plan referred to as Vision 2030 .
The arrests send a clear message that corruption won't be tolerated as the kingdom pushes through its plan for economic reform, said Mohammed Alyahya, a Saudi political analyst and nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 893 of 1177

in Washington, D.C.
""MBS has made it very clear that he will crack down on corruption, and that he is willing to do it from the top first,"" Mr. Alyahya said, using a popular acronym for Prince Mohammed. ""The bottom line is that corruption costs the government. We have economic problems...There is no way you can achieve Vision 2030 without tackling these issues.""
But the firing and arrest of Mr. Fakieh also creates a new complication for the kingdom's economic plan, in which Mr. Fakieh had been playing a leading role.
The economic plan is already facing setbacks, such as a delay of the IPO of as much as 5% of Saudi Aramco, a centerpiece of the program.
Mr. Fakieh, who also served in the cabinet under King Salman's predecessor, is succeeded by his deputy, Mohammed bin Mazyad al-Tuwajiri, a former banker at HSBC Holdings PLC.
Mr. Miteb was replaced at the National Guard by another, less prominent royal. Mr. Miteb is a son of the monarch's predecessor, King Abdullah, and was one of few princes in a position of authority outside King Salman's branch of the royal family. According to people familiar with the matter, he was among several senior princes who opposed the king's decision in June to depose Prince Mohammed bin Nayef as crown prince in favor of Prince Mohammed.
The moves come as Saudi Arabia, a Sunni Muslim-dominated country, is fighting a war in Yemen, works to contain the influence of rival Iran, and is entangled in a political crisis involving its former ally Qatar.
Also Saturday, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, one of Saudi Arabia's allies, stepped down from his post, saying he feared an assassination plot. Mr. Hariri blamed Iran for stoking tensions in his country.

HSBC,New York Stock Exchange Composite List," Nov 6, 2017",0,
HSBC,Exchange-Traded Portfolios," Nov 6, 2017",1,
HSBC,China to Give Foreigners Greater Access to Its Financial Sector," Nov 10, 2017",1,"
BEIJING--China took a major step in opening up its financial sector, announcing a relaxation of restrictions on foreign ownership in the securities and banking sectors just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump concluded his visit to Beijing .
Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao announced the moves at a briefing Friday, saying they will allow foreign companies to hold majority stakes in Chinese securities, fund-management and futures firms as well as commercial banks. Foreigners will also eventually be able to take over Chinese insurance firms.
The relaxation in the securities industry potentially paves the way for Wall Street investment banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. to increase their presence in China's hard-to-crack domestic market. Currently, such firms have to pair with local brokerages in joint ventures and have been largely excluded from lucrative businesses such as trading in Chinese stocks and bonds and managing money for wealthy clients.
However, Mr. Zhu indicated the securities-industry changes would be limited, at least initially. He said detailed regulations still have to be formulated and declined to provide details on specific firms that are expected to participate, saying the securities opening would be for ""single or multiple foreign investors"" and would take effect ""very quickly.""
China will allow foreign companies to hold 51% of domestic-securities firms, up from 49% previously, and with a plan for the 51% cap to be removed three years after the new limit takes effect. The country will also remove caps for foreign stakes in Chinese banks. Under regulatory thresholds, a single foreign investor can hold as much as a 20% stake in a Chinese bank and a group of foreign investors can own up to 25% in a single bank. The government also will allow 51% foreign ownership in Chinese life-insurance companies in three years and lift that restriction entirely in five years.
So far, HSBC Holdings PLC has been the only foreign bank to win regulatory approval for a majority-owned securities joint venture in China. HSBC received approval in June under special rules for Hong Kong-funded banks.
In recent years, foreign investment banks have been considering what to do about their China operations. In September, Morgan Stanley increased its stake in its Chinese joint venture to 49%, according to a filing, while UBS Group AG is in deliberations to do the same, people familiar with the matter have said.
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 898 of 1177
""China is a key market for UBS and, as indicated previously, we continue to work toward increasing our stake,"" said Eugene Qian, head of UBS's China business.
China also announced Thursday it would lift ownership restrictions by June for new-energy vehicles in pilot free- trade zones ""on a trial basis."" Taken together, the moves reflect an effort to project openness, with limited impact for Chinese companies.
Chinese officials have been floating possible market openings to foreign firms for months. In June, People's Bank of China Gov. Zhou Xiaochuan indicated that Beijing was working on plans to allow foreign firms greater access to the country's financial sector. Last month, China's top banking regulator, Guo Shuqing, said a drop in foreign banks' market share in China was bad for competition. He also indicated that China would give overseas banks ""more room"" in equity ownership and business scope.
Despite those hints, members of the U.S. business community had played down the likelihood that Mr. Trump's summit with China's President Xi Jinping would lead to significant improvement in market access.
The Trump administration, which has threatened sanctions against China for its restrictions on foreign companies in key sectors, is expected to turn up the heat again on a trade investigation that it put on the back burner ahead of the president's visit to Beijing.
Analysts generally greeted the announcement as significant, saying it shows China's commitment to financial liberalization and that the country likely feels more comfortable with some opening now that its own financial institutions have firmly established their hold on the market. But they also say the moves announced Friday are unlikely to dramatically alter China's financial system .
Chinese banks, for example, have formed deep relationships with corporate Chinese clients, who might be wary of working with unfamiliar foreign brands.
""It's certainly a positive development but the reality is [foreign firms] cannot compete with the sheer size of the domestic institutions,"" says Andrew Polk, an economist at Trivium/China.
Top Wall Street investment banks could win over business by making the case to Beijing that they can help professionalize China's capital markets. They could get more cross-border business, for example, by deepening relationships with Chinese firms onshore.
""Allowing foreign fund managers to have greater access will help diversify investment products and elevate the overall competitiveness of China's asset-management industry,"" said Ivan Shi, director of research at consultancy Z-Ben Advisors.
Still, analysts say Chinese securities firms will likely retain their incumbent advantage and that Chinese banks have become sophisticated enough to see little need for foreign expertise.
In addition, interest from foreign investors in Chinese commercial banks has been lukewarm in recent years. Since the 2008 global financial crisis, many U.S. and European banks have sold their multiyear investments in Chinese banks to bolster their capital bases and focus on their main businesses. For instance, Bank of America Corp. sold its entire equity stake in China Construction Bank Corp. in 2013, and Goldman Sachs sold its investment in Industrial &Commercial Bank of China Ltd. earlier that year.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 899 of 1177

Last year, Citigroup Inc. sold its 20% stake in China Guangfa Bank, while Deutsche Bank sold its 20% stake in Hua Xia Bank Co. Only one Chinese bank, Bank of Communications Co., now has foreign ownership, by HSBC, that approaches the regulatory limit.
""If foreign banks look to enter China's banking industry again, they might be more interested in owning stakes in mid- and small-sized Chinese banks this time around,"" said Standard &Poor's analyst Liao Qiang. Holding stakes in small lenders would require less money set aside by foreign banks under tightened capital rules.

HSBC,HSBC Accounts Used for Transactions Linked to Suspected South Africa Kickbacks; Transfers detailed in documents shine light on the role of global banks in a scandal that has consumed South African business and politics," Nov 10, 2017",1,"
South Africa's Gupta family used HSBC Holdings PLC bank accounts in Dubai to transfer millions of dollars through companies that have been linked to suspected kickbacks for the sale of Chinese locomotives, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 901 of 1177
The documents show money moving among three United Arab Emirates-based firms in January and February 2013 through HSBC accounts while one of the firms was receiving payments from a Chinese rail company with a contract to sell locomotives to a South African state-owned enterprise.
One of the documents, a spreadsheet of bank transactions, shows that the transfers among U.A.E.-based firms were made in dollars and cleared by HSBC in New York.
The spreadsheet and other documents cited in this article were among a trove of emails, bank statements and other documents that appear to have been obtained from Gupta-controlled companies earlier this year. The documents have buttressed longstanding suspicions among many South Africans that the powerful business clan leveraged its connection to President Jacob Zuma and other government officials to amass great personal wealth.
They also underscore the risks for banks of processing potentially illicit money flows.
HSBC said it is determined to keep criminals out of the financial system. It said it ""has been reviewing its exposure to the Guptas for some time, and has closed a number of accounts for associated front companies wherever we have found them.""
""This is inherently challenging because those who seek to launder money are often extremely sophisticated, hiding behind legitimate companies, layers of front companies, connected parties and individuals that have controlling interests in the subject companies,"" HSBC said.
South Africa's amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism published documents in June showing the Guptas were involved in arranging the contacts between CSR Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Co., a subsidiary of China's state-owned CRRC Group, and South African rail-and-port operator Transnet. It said the documents present evidence Gupta family companies received kickbacks of around 20% on three locomotive deals from CSR and other CRRC subsidiaries.
CRRC Group didn't respond to a request for comment.
South African police and prosecutors have said they are investigating allegations of wrongdoing by people and companies with ties to the Guptas, including potential kickbacks from international companies.
The Guptas, who didn't respond to a request for comment for this article, have previously denied wrongdoing. Atul Gupta, who leads the family's businesses, has said without elaboration that ""there is no authenticity"" to the documents, which have been dubbed #GuptaLeaks in South Africa. Mr. Zuma has also denied wrongdoing.
The possible role of U.K. banks in Gupta-related business was raised in October by Peter Hain, a former cabinet minister and a member of the U.K.'s House of Lords. At the time, the U.K. financial regulator said it had already asked two banks named by Lord Hain, HSBC and Standard Chartered PLC, to review possible Gupta-related business.
Standard Chartered said it shut down some accounts linked to the Guptas in 2014 after an internal investigation.
In a letter sent last week to U.K. Treasury chief Philip Hammond and seen by the Journal, Lord Hain accused HSBC of sanctioning money laundering. He alleged that accounts with U.K.-based HSBC in Dubai and Hong Kong were used for Gupta money transfers out of South Africa. He told Mr. Hammond that some of the transactions had been
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 902 of 1177

flagged as suspicious by HSBC staff, but ""I am informed that they were told by HSBC UK to ignore it."" HSBC denies that it sanctioned money laundering.
HSBC has spent billions of dollars improving its financial crime-fighting systems and hired thousands of compliance staff since paying $1.9 billion in 2012 to settle U.S. allegations of money laundering and sanctions breaches. Under the terms of a five-year deferred prosecution agreement, part of that settlement with the Justice Department, it must raise its standards to an agreed level or face an extension of the agreement, additional conditions or criminal prosecution.
The transactions in the #GuptaLeaks spreadsheet could draw scrutiny from U.S. authorities, since they are listed as having been made in dollars and cleared by HSBC in New York.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is examining funds involving Gupta-linked businesses that may have traveled through the U.S. financial system, and the role any U.S. companies may have played, according to people familiar with the matter.
The spreadsheet shows a total of $2 million moving from two U.A.E. companies--Century General Trading FZE and JJ Trading FZE--to a third U.A.E. company, Global Corporation LLP, in January and February 2013.
The three companies appeared to be controlled by the Guptas, according to correspondence and financial data in the #GuptaLeaks documents.
Century General Trading and JJ Trading didn't respond to calls seeking comment. Global Corporation couldn't be reached for comment.
Other #GuptaLeaks documents show that Century General Trading had another lucrative stream of revenue at the time. In October 2012, Chinese rail company CSR signed a 2.69 billion rand ($190 million) deal with South African state-owned Transnet for 95 locomotives. As part of the deal, CSR pledged to pay 20% of its proceeds, or 537.3 million rand, to Century General Trading, according to a table setting out the payments the firms were to receive from the Chinese company.
Transnet said it is investigating the procurement processes for the locomotive deals.
Emails from the months preceding the deal show that the Guptas and companies they controlled were involved in arranging the agreement.
One email chain from January 2012 shows that CSR directors forwarded a letter to the Transnet chief executive seeking participation in the locomotive tender to several employees and executives at Gupta-owned companies.
The transactions processed via HSBC accounts in early 2013 are part of much-larger money flows due to JJ Trading and Century General Trading in the years to come. One document states that by 2015, the two companies were entitled to 5.27 billion rand in payments from CSR, as the Chinese company went on to win two more tenders with Transnet, for 100 and 359 locomotives, respectively. The funds from the later deals, between 20% and 21% of the total proceeds, had been promised to JJ Trading, according to the document.
It is unclear how payments after February 2013 were processed. The JJ Trading and Century General Trading

French prosecutors began investigating HSBC in 2014 as part of a widening probe into whether the bank breached laws authorizing only French-registered lenders to sign up customers in the country. The investigation also examined whether the bank was complicit in laundering the proceeds of any tax evasion.
According to a statement from the French prosecutors office Tuesday, more than [euro]1.6 billion worth of client assets were shielded from French taxes. French authorities said they discovered the assets after seizing computer documents found at the French home of a former HSBC employee in 2009.
HSBC said that under the agreement announced Tuesday, there is no finding of guilt on the part of the Swiss Private Bank. It has provisioned fully for the amount.
The settlement was the first in France under a new law passed last year modeled on U.S. deferred prosecution agreements.

HSBC,"How Companies Are Pushing Ahead on Climate-Change Targets; More global firms pledge to cut carbon emissions to cut costs, draw investment and get ahead of new laws"," Nov 16, 2017",1,"More of the world's biggest corporations are taking the fight against climate change into their own hands, aiming to cut their energy costs, pre-empt regulation or burnish their reputations with investors and customers.
Apple Inc. has draped its new California campus with solar panels. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. cut the energy consumption of its refrigerators. Steelmaker Thyssenkrupp AG streamlined trucking routes, Dell Inc. made its servers less power-hungry and Microsoft Corp. pledged Tuesday to slash its carbon output.
Among just over 1,000 of the world's biggest publicly listed companies, accounting for about 12% of total greenhouse-gas emissions, 89% have plans to cut those emissions, according to a survey from the CDP, a nonprofit platform for corporate environmental disclosures. That is a 16 percentage-point increase since 2011, said the CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project. Earlier this month, a group led by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and California Gov. Jerry Brown presented a climate pledge under which 1,400 businesses have set emissions-reduction targets.
As world leaders gathered in Bonn, Germany, this week to negotiate enforcement of the 2015 United Nations Paris Agreement on capping climate change, company and bank executives said corporations will be as crucial as governments in making good on the U.N. pact, from which U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to withdraw .
""The world is going to be saved or doomed by what the private sector will be doing,"" said Steven Tebbe, the CDP's managing director in Europe.
Yet while the CDP survey shows many large companies world-wide have committed to emissions-cutting targets, some investors and environmental analysts say those goals are rarely ambitious enough to meet the U.N.'s aim to cap global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. The U.N. said last week that the average global temperature from January to September 2017 was about 1.1°C above the preindustrial era.
""Companies have been setting targets for more than a decade now,"" said Cynthia Cummis, director of private- sector climate mitigation at the environmental think tank World Resources Institute. ""But when you look at them they're often just leading to incremental change.""
Only 14% of the companies in the CDP study have committed to emissions-cutting goals that align with the U.N. target--an effort backed by the World Resources Institute--although another 30% have vowed to set such targets in the next two years.
Some companies have resisted the trend. According to the CDP's survey, the natural-resource and financial sectors have the greatest number of companies with no targets at all. Some companies that support the Paris goals have also criticized the practice, saying firm emissions targets are inflexible and counterproductive. Royal Dutch Shell PLC this year batted off a proposal from investors to set binding targets, but sought to allay their
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 911 of 1177
concerns with plans to link executive bonuses to emissions reductions.
""Don't expect that the complexity of this system can be boiled down into a simple numerical target,"" Shell CEO Ben van Beurden told investors in May.
Still, many companies are pushing ahead with emissions cuts, saying they make sense on the bottom line.
Investors with $100 trillion in assets world-wide--including BlackRock Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.--say they refer to the CDP's database when making investment decisions.
This month HSBC Holdings PLC said it would invest $100 billion in low-carbon businesses before 2025, and cut financing for new coal-fired power plants in the developed world and thermal-coal mines world-wide.
""You don't want to be the last one that wants to get out of certain assets once you realize they are no longer viable,"" said Daniel Klier, HSBC Holdings' global head of strategy and sustainable finance.
Companies say setting targets and working to cut emissions helps them get a head start on any coming government mandates.
""Once lawmakers begin making rules and coming to us for comment, it's too late to start,"" said Thomas Fußho?ller, head of sustainability, environment and energy management at Germany's Thyssenkrupp, which plans to cut a million tons of carbon dioxide a year from its production processes by 2020. The company emitted about 34 million tons of CO2 in 2014.
In terms of money saved from measures like streamlining trucking routes and recycling heat, Thyssenkrupp estimates a million-ton cut in carbon emissions will produce cost savings in the ""high millions"" of euros.
The CDP's Mr. Tebbe said there is a correlation between emissions targets and cost savings. ""If you save on energy, you save on your supply chain, you're going to run a tighter ship,"" he said.
Microsoft says it has saved millions of dollars through efforts to improve efficiency and reduce consumption at its headquarters.
Taking action on climate is ""increasingly fundamental to our business,"" said Michelle Patron, director of sustainability policy at the software giant, which Tuesday pledged to cut its carbon emissions by 75% from 2013 levels by 2030. Microsoft, whose data centers consume as much energy as Vermont, already aims to get 50% of its energy from renewable sources by the end of 2018.
Meanwhile, Apple has called the 17 megawatts of generation capacity at its new headquarters ""one of the largest on-site solar energy installations in the world.""
Investors and companies also say climate-change policies help attract customers.
This year Wal-Mart launched an effort called Project Gigaton to remove one billion tons of carbon dioxide--the amount more than 211 million passenger cars emit in one year--from its supply chain between 2015 and 2030. It ""inspires brand loyalty,"" according to Laura Phillips, senior vice president for global sustainability.

The so-called reputation bonus also pushed China's Yingli Group Co., a global solar-panel manufacturer, to set emissions targets for its production and supply chain. ""We want to play a leading role"" in efforts to rein in climate change, a Yingli spokeswoman said.

HSBC,"U.S. Rebuffs China's Charm Offensive, Edging Closer to Trade War; U.S. looks at sanctions with the goal of fundamentally challenging Chinese trade practices"," Nov 19, 2017",0,"A month before President Donald Trump's visit to Beijing, Chinese officials presented an offer they thought Washington couldn't refuse.
China proposed that during the trip, Mr. Trump and his counterpart, Xi Jinping, unveil a plan to widen foreign firms' access to China's vast financial industry, according to people with knowledge of the matter. It was a move previous U.S. administrations had sought for years.
To Beijing's consternation, according to the people, Washington wasn't interested. The offer was made a second time during one of Mr. Trump's meetings at the Great Hall of the People. Hours after Air Force One took off from Beijing, China announced the opening on its own .
The cold shoulder from the White House reflects a fundamental shift in how the U.S. manages its relationship with China, one that suggests a bold gamble and a rocky road ahead despite the bonhomie of the presidential summit earlier this month in Beijing.
The financial opening initially attracted wide attention from market participants, and Beijing called it evidence of
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 914 of 1177
its commitment to market liberalization. U.S. reaction has been tepid. A White House spokeswoman on Friday called it ""welcome but long overdue"" and said: ""It is also only one of a plethora of problems China needs to address in order to provide fair and reciprocal access to its market.""
The Trump administration, which recently completed a comprehensive review of China policy, is rejecting the longstanding practice of eking out concessions from Beijing on trade and market access around high-level meetings.
To Mr. Trump and his aides, that approach has yielded few substantive benefits but allowed China to continue policies that put American businesses at a disadvantage. One White House official refers to that pattern as Beijing's ""rope-a-dope"" strategy. The administration is now investigating trade sanctions or enforcement actions against China with the goal of fundamentally challenging Chinese trade practices .
The White House is also trying to invest in the personal relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi to absorb some of the shock of the coming trade measures.
That helps explain Mr. Trump's unorthodox blend of tough talk on trade and effusive praise for Mr. Xi in Beijing. In China and around the globe, the White House is aiming to make an asset out of Mr. Trump's unpredictability , which has been criticized by foreign-policy experts as a destabilizing influence on international negotiations over trade and national security.
""The U.S. now believes that only the threat of unilateral action will compel China to change,"" says Scott Kennedy, a deputy director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
The new China strategy carries considerable risk. Some policy experts fear it could set off a trade war. Others, especially advocates of harsh sanctions, worry Mr. Trump might not follow through if Beijing steps up its charm offensive with further attempts to flatter him or if his agenda becomes monopolized by domestic issues, especially the tax overhaul proposed by the Republicans in Congress .
Still, in Beijing, the prospect of a much tougher U.S. stance is starting to sink in. China had hoped to show it is doing its part to improve the relationship by granting Mr. Trump a ""state-visit-plus""--including a private dinner with Mr. Xi in the Forbidden City--and opening the financial sector.
""China realizes that it can't continue to drive away foreign capital,"" says He Fan, a professor at Peking University HSBC School of Business. ""It likely will take more measures to open up its economy.""
Beijing is likely to point to any opening measures, however symbolic, to argue against unilateral action by Washington.
Under the new financial opening, Beijing pledged to let foreign securities firms own majority stakes in their Chinese ventures and to scrap foreign ownership limits on Chinese banks. Officials indicated the security-industry changes would be limited, at least initially.
Western officials treat such pronouncements with skepticism, pointing to China's poor follow-up record and saying hurdles have grown despite similar pledges in the past.
""This opening-up comes at a late stage in development,"" said the European Chamber of Commerce in a statement.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 915 of 1177

""It is now difficult for foreign firms to capitalize on these changes as domestic Chinese firms have stronger positions in their respective industry.""
Such views are shared by U.S. officials. ""The overall approach now is not to negotiate over crumbs, not celebrate small deals that will have limited impact,"" one official said.
While attending meetings by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington in October, China's Vice Finance minister Zhu Guangyao told U.S. officials about the new financial-opening plan, according to the people familiar with the discussions. The Chinese side had expected U.S. officials would welcome the proposal and agree to roll it out as a breakthrough during Mr. Trump's visit to Beijing.
Instead, U.S. officials called it too little too late.
""We said, 'No, we're not going to take your gifts because you're just trying to sucker us,'"" said a U.S. official familiar with the discussions. ""The idea with China is no negotiation because it will just make us beholden to them and reluctant to slam them on other stuff.""
The Trump administration trade team is weighing a half-dozen trade enforcement actions that are aimed directly, or indirectly, at China, with decisions expected by early next year.
The team is looking at invoking a Cold War-era law that was last used in the early 1980s to block steel and aluminum imports in the name of national security. It is also studying dusting off another law last used in 2002 to protect domestic producers claiming to have been damaged by a sudden surge of cheap imports; solar panels and washing machines are goods in focus.
Shortly before Mr. Trump's trip to Beijing, his Commerce Department issued a lengthy study justifying the continuing branding of China as a ""nonmarket economy,"" a status that allows the U.S. to impose extra high duties on Chinese imports found to have been illegally subsidized or ""dumped"" below production costs. Commerce has since imposed duties of up to 162% on Chinese aluminum foil and 194% for hardwood plywood. China has filed a complaint over that designation to the World Trade Organization.
At the same time, Mr. Trump's trade agency is building a broad case to charge China with ""unfair trade practices"" by improperly pressuring American companies to turn over valuable intellectual property as the price for entering the Chinese market.
Still, the question is when, or whether, the administration will actually take action on these fronts. So far, trade enforcement has taken a back seat to White House priorities such as winning passage of a tax cut and securing Chinese cooperation to curb North Korea's nuclear program.
U.S. officials have struggled to find remedies that won't trigger a wide backlash from industries that consume Chinese products or free-trade Republicans in Congress. Excessively harsh sanctions could also provoke a full- blown trade war, some policy experts say.
Although an open line to Mr. Xi could help in managing a trade crisis and allow for more meaningful deal-making, efforts to forge a personal rapport with previous Chinese leaders have rarely borne fruit.
""The development of personal relations is a fact, not a strategy,"" the White House spokeswoman said. Messrs.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 916 of 1177

Trump and Xi ""seem to have established a good personal relationship, as the president has with many world leaders,"" she added.
Already, some supporters of Mr. Trump's promised China trade crackdown have grown frustrated at the limited results. The Alliance for American Manufacturing, a group formed by the United Steelworkers union and U.S. steelmakers, praised Mr. Trump in April when he launched his study on national-security steel tariffs, and his aides had promised action by June.
Now, they have launched a petition drive protesting the delays and demanding the administration follow through.
The deadline ""is long past -- and still no action,"" the petition reads. ""President Trump pledged to stand up for America's working class--and it's time for him to make good on his word.""
Asked Tuesday at The Wall Street Journal CEO Council about the delays, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said: ""Well, the president has indicated that he doesn't want that to come out until after the tax legislation is dealt with.""

The Hang Seng Index ended 0.6% higher at 30003.49 on Wednesday, its fourth straight day of gains, driven by financial companies such as index heavyweight HSBC Holdings PLC. The benchmark has risen about 5.3% this month and 36% for the year, putting it among the best-performing stock indexes in 2017 , although it is still about 5% shy of its all-time closing high in Oct. 2007.
The gains follow a
series of records set by U.S. benchmarks including the S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Russell 2000. In Asia, the Nikkei Stock Average this month hit a quarter-century high , while the MSCI All Country Asia ex-Japan index set a record this summer.
A surge of capital flowing from mainland Chinese funds into Hong Kong-listed stocks has fueled this year's rally: Investors in mainland China can invest in the market through the so-called Stock Connect trading links with Shanghai and Shenzhen. For the week ended Nov. 17, net buying from mainland investors was one of the heaviest of the year, according to Kenneth Chan, global quantitative strategist at Jefferies in Hong Kong.

""There's a new source of liquidity in this market which is southbound flows,"" said Andrew Swan, head of Asian and global emerging-market equities at BlackRock. ""It's an influence on this market which is new and it's large and it's continuing to grow.""
The market has also benefited from this year's global rally in tech stocks , although in Hong Kong's case that is largely down to one stock--Chinese videogames and social-media giant Tencent. Its shares have more than doubled in value this year, accounting for almost one-third of the Hang Seng Index's overall gains.
The company, which runs the wildly popular WeChat messaging app, earlier this week became the first Asian tech company to achieve a $500 billion market capitalization , exceeding U.S. social-media giant Facebook Inc. in value. Tencent was recently down 0.7% on Wednesday.
Hong Kong has recently witnessed a spate of initial public offerings of tech-related stocks , such as Tencent subsidiary China Literature Ltd., which owns a large online library of works by Chinese authors, and Razer Inc., which sells hardware to videogame players around the world. Those stocks have tended to surge in value straight after their flotations.
Their strong performance is making some investors nervous.
""I think a bubble is starting to emerge,"" said BlackRock's Mr. Swan. ""Not all technology companies are created equal."" Mr. Swan said BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, was now ""underweight"" Asian tech stocks, meaning it owns less of the sector than suggested by its benchmark.
Even amid this year's rally, the Hang Seng Index's valuation looks attractive relative to its global peers. Trading at 13 times projected earnings over the next 12 months, its price-to-earnings ratio is well below the more than 19 times it fetched a decade ago, when the market was at record levels. The S&P 500 currently trades at around 18 times expected earnings.
Global investors have spent most of the year wary of the rally in Chinese stocks, many of which are listed in Hong Kong, citing opaque accounting standards and high levels of leverage. Some, though, have started to change their minds.
UBS Wealth Management's chief investment office said Wednesday it would add to its holdings of stocks in Asia outside of Japan above the level suggested by its benchmark. It cited company earnings that have recovered ""vigorously"", adding that investors were ""supportive, but not yet euphoric.""

HSBC,"Eurozone Data Point to Strengthening Recovery; PMI data beats expectations, powered by France's highest reading since mid-2011"," Nov 23, 2017",0,"The eurozone economy appears to have gained fresh momentum as 2017 draws to a close, led by a revival in France.
The fresh acceleration bodes well for next year, and suggests the $10 trillion economy may again partner the U.S. in supporting a stronger global expansion.
Data firm IHS Markit on Thursday said its composite Purchasing Managers Index for the eurozone--based on survey responses from 5,000 manufacturers and service providers--rose to 57.5 in November from 56.0 in October, reaching its highest level in more than 61?2 years. A reading above 50.0 signals an expansion in activity.
That was a stronger outcome than most economists had expected, with those surveyed by The Wall Street Journal last week expecting to see an unchanged reading.
Chris Williamson, IHS Markit's chief business economist, said the measure suggests the eurozone economy will grow at a quarter-to-quarter rate of 0.8% in the final three months of the year, which would mark a pickup from 0.6% in the three months through September .
""The message from the latest eurozone PMI is clear: Business is booming,"" he said.
France was the main source of surprise, recording its highest reading since the middle of 2011. That surge was led by its services sector, the PMI for which jumped to 60.2 from 57.3, confounding economists' expectations of a drop to 57.0. In a separate survey, the French statistics agency Thursday reported that manufacturing confidence hit a decade high in November.
France's economy has been growing over half a percentage point a quarter for a year, fueled by a strong recovery in business investment and steady consumer spending growth. In 2017, the country's national statistics bureau expects the economy to expand 1.8%, breaking with several years of meager growth.
The stronger growth is a shot in the arm for President Emmanuel Macron, helping the 39-year-old leader reduce France's budget deficit and smoothing the implementation of contentious changes to labor laws.
Still, employment remains a weak spot in France's economic recovery. The latest figures showed unemployment rose to 9.7% in the third quarter--the first quarter-on-quarter increase for two years--and monthly counts of job seekers have shown volatility since Mr. Macron took office in May .
However, there was encouraging news for Mr. Macron in the survey of purchasing managers, which showed new jobs being created at the fastest pace in 16 years. That rapid pace of hiring was shared across the eurozone.
A stronger French economy would add support to Germany's leadership of a stronger recovery. Germany's
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 930 of 1177
statistics agency Thursday confirmed that its economy grew at a quarter-to-quarter rate of 0.8% in the three months through September, making it the strongest of the Group of Seven largest developed countries in that period.
The PMI for Germany points to continued strength in the final three months of this year, although the failure to form a government following elections in late September may take a toll on activity if it is prolonged.
The surveys come a day after the European Commission's measure of consumer confidence hit its highest level since January 2001.
The strength of those indicators suggest economists may be wrong to expect a modest slowdown in growth in 2018. They include economists working for the European Central Bank, who expect economic growth to ease to 1.8% from 2.2% this year.
""Next month's ECB meeting will see a fresh set of staff forecasts released alongside,"" said Cathal Kennedy, an economist at Royal Bank of Canada. ""Following today's PMIs...our expectation is that they will upgrade the 2017 GDP growth forecast with the 2018 forecast...also likely to be revised upward.""
Were the economy to prove stronger than they had expected, policy makers at the central bank would be less likely to approve another extension of their bond-buying program beyond its tentatively scheduled end in September 2018. The surveys of purchasing managers also recorded a pickup in inflationary pressures, with prices charged by businesses rising at the fastest pace since mid-2011.
""The ECB will be pleased to see that firms' pricing power seems to be coming back, which bodes well for future inflation,"" said Fabio Balboni, an economist at HSBC.

HSBC,HSBC's Global Banking Co-Head Leaves After 18 Months; Former Goldman Sachs banker Matthew Westerman to leave HSBC just 18 months after joining," Nov 23, 2017",1,"LONDON--HSBC Holdings PLC's global banking co-head, Matthew Westerman, will leave after a turbulent 18 months at the bank, staff were told in a memo Thursday.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 932 of 1177
Mr. Westerman had been hired from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in February 2016 by departing HSBC Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver, and started at the bank that May. His sudden departure leaves Robin Phillips as the sole head of the global banking unit. No reason was given for his departure.
Mr. Westerman was a 16-year veteran of Goldman Sachs and chairman of its investment bank in Europe, Middle East and Africa when he was recruited by Mr. Gulliver and other HSBC executives. It was regarded as a trophy hire and expectations were high that Mr. Westerman would push HSBC to raise its game in areas of investment banking where it long had lagged behind rivals.
Those ambitions were apparent when, within weeks of starting, Mr. Westerman and Mr. Phillips announced a revamp of the global banking unit and pushed out several veteran HSBC business heads. Others departed as their responsibilities were shifted and Mr. Westerman consolidated his control.
Analysts for the most part had welcomed the shake-up Mr. Westerman espoused. He was seen as helping parts of the bank reset their approach to winning clients, and as a positive force for introducing measures making bankers and other employees more accountable for their time. Product and sector teams were combined to better cover clients.
Pretax profit across HSBC's global banking and markets rose to $4.9 billion in the first nine months of 2017, from $4.1 billion in the corresponding 2016 period. Revenue rose 6%.
But Mr. Westerman also ruffled feathers with his more-aggressive approach, according to former and current employees, at a bank whose colonialist past still underpins aspects of its culture. While he was in the job, some employees and analysts said Mr. Westerman reminded them of John Studzinski, the former Morgan Stanley executive hired by HSBC to build a full-service investment bank in the early 2000s alongside Mr. Gulliver. The cultural fit didn't work that time either, and Mr. Studzinski left after a rocky three years.
Samir Assaf, chief executive of global banking and markets, said Mr. Westerman in his time at HSBC had ""ensured the business is better placed to serve our client base with the products, advice and services they need,"" and ""reinvigorated our approach to collaboration.""
Mr. Westerman's departure comes as Mr. Gulliver prepares to cede the top role to retail head John Flint in February. Mr. Gulliver said in February he would retire from the bank in 2018, setting off a CEO search by the bank's new chairman, Mark Tucker.
Mr. Assaf had been a contender for the CEO job and if he had secured it, or decided to leave, Mr. Westerman would have been a leading candidate to replace him, according to analysts and people familiar with the matter.
In October, when Mr. Flint was named CEO , Mr. Tucker told The Wall Street Journal he expected Mr. Assaf and other internal candidates passed over for the CEO role to remain at the bank.

And even though all seven banks passed, some will still face higher capital demands to counter a consumer credit boom in which they are systematically underestimating the risk of losses.
Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, which both struggled in last year's test, were only given a pass this time on the basis of capital they have raised during this year. Barclays only just squeaked home even with that allowance.
The test set the toughest conditions yet from the Bank of England, worse it said than what it could imagine in a disorderly Brexit scenario, in which the U.K.'s departure from the European Union caused serious economic disruption. In the test, U.K. banks endured a combined £50 billion in loan losses over two years as house prices fell 33%, interest rates rose 3.25 percentage points, global economic output dropped 2.4% and sterling fell 27%.
Though everyone passed, shareholders and high-earning bankers took the brunt of the pain: Dividends were cut to zero for all listed banks and bonuses cut heavily.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 937 of 1177
There was a bright spot for some banks: They could still pay the interest on their risky junior debt, which has been a highly volatile investment in recent years. Standard Chartered could pay all coupons on its so-called Additional Tier One debt, junior bonds that convert into equity or soak up losses in a crisis. Lloyds Banking Group could cover about two-thirds of its coupons and HSBC only a token amount. Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland paid nothing.
Part of Barclays's problem is its exposure to consumer credit, a big focus of the test. Losses on credit cards in the test totaled a quarter of outstanding debt. That carries a sting in the tail for shareholders because the Bank of England said Tuesday it would next year lift the capital requirements of those most exposed.
The regulator didn't say which banks were likely to face the highest demands, but Barclays as the U.K.'s biggest card lender is almost certainly in its sights. Barclays and its competitors have been increasing unsecured lending while reducing the amount of capital they hold against it by cutting their assessments of how risky it is and moving into riskier markets such as people with lower credit scores.
This suggests disappointment to come for Barclays investors hoping for better dividends, and its executives who want to grow the investment bank. Barclays's balance sheet still needs more shoring up.

HSBC,Tencent's Sharp Rally Just Hit the Skids; Giant logs correction after making market-cap history for an Asian tech company," Dec 1, 2017",0,"
Shares of Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. logged their first correction of 2017, falling more than 10% from their latest record high set last week after briefly surpassing Facebook Inc. in market value .
The development comes during this week's global pullback in tech stocks , particularly those which have recorded big 2017 gains. On Wednesday, the S&P 500's tech sector suffered its third-worst trading day of the year while the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index slid 4.4%, its biggest decline of 2017.
Tencent, the company behind the popular messaging app WeChat, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the booming tech sector in Asia. Its Hong Kong-listed shares have still more than doubled this year despite the 11% pullback from its recent high. Last month, it became the first Asian tech company to see its market capitalization reach $500 billion.

The stock surge has helped fuel concerns that shares have become overheated. There has also been worry about whether Tencent's steady string of strong earnings results will be sustainable.
The stock was down 2% Friday afternoon, trading some 40 times projected earnings for the next 12 months, according to FactSet. That is about its highest forward multiple since 2014.
Sean Darby, chief global strategist at Jefferies in Hong Kong, is recommending investors rotate out many of the tech highfliers. They include the FANG stocks of the U.S.--Facebook, Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc.--as well as Asia's so-called BAT stocks--Baidu Inc., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent.
""The market appears to have moved to excessively owning a few winners,"" Mr. Darby said. ""This is not the time to own all of them."" Should the declines continue, he added, the risk is that a ""selloff could be quite violent.""
Index moves have also helped fuel some of the Tencent selling. Following the close of trading Friday is the semiannual rebalancing of indexes compiled by MSCI Inc. There will also be changes, effective Monday, in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, of which Tencent has become the biggest component this year with its stock surge.
The Hang Seng benchmark theoretically limits any stock to comprising 10% of the index, but Tencent has recently approached 12% after its price gains. The changes on Monday will include two new companies joining the 50-stock index, which will move Tencent back to a 10% index weighting.
Tencent's shares have jumped 40% since midyear and its market cap is double the next-biggest stock in the Hang Seng, large bank HSBC Holdings PLC. That firm also makes up 10% of the index.
Tencent, the world's largest videogame publisher by revenue , is best known in China for its WeChat and QQ messaging and mobile-payment apps, which are installed on almost every PC and smartphone there.
The company has lifted its international profile too, with several big deals in recent years. It recently purchased a 12% stake in Los Angeles social-media company Snap Inc., becoming one of its largest shareholders, Snap announced in November. It also bought a 5% stake in Tesla Inc. earlier this year.
It's all resulted in the stock becoming a global favorite, with investors buying every dip this year. The last time Tencent entered correction territory, defined as a decline of 10% from a recent high, was the 18% drop seen from September to December 2016. A drop of at least 20% is typically considered a bear market.
Regional tech stocks have been the biggest drivers of Asian stock benchmarks, thanks to their outsize weighting in those indexes. While they helped propel a number of Asian indexes to multiyear or record highs in 2017, this week's weakness has exposed the benchmarks' vulnerability.
Korea's Kospi has fallen 2.7% this week as Samsung Electronics--which makes up more than 20% of that index-- slumped 8.4% following a start-of-week Morgan Stanley downgrade on concerns about memory-chip pricing and valuation worries about the stock.
Despite being poised to log its worst week in 5 1?2 years, Samsung shares are still up 41% this year. John Wu contributed to this article.

HSBC,Cineworld to Buy Regal in $3.6 Billion Movie Theater Deal; Deal creates world's second-largest cinema operator," Dec 5, 2017",1,"British movie theater operator Cineworld Group PLC has agreed to buy American counterpart Regal Entertainment Group for $3.6 billion, creating the world's second-largest cinema operator.
Cineworld said Tuesday the deal would give it a meaningful footprint in the U.S.--the biggest box office market--and create a company with more than 9,000 screens.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 944 of 1177
It added that the combined group's scale will help it mitigate any volatility in particular markets and match the global nature of rivals, including industry leader AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.
AMC, part of China's Dalian Wanda Group, last year bought Odeon &UCI Cinemas Group in Europe , and ran or had interests in more than 11,000 screens in 1,006 theaters as of Sept. 30, according to regulatory filings.
Cineworld will pay $23 a share for Regal as announced last week when it confirmed that the two companies were in talks.
Regal is the second-largest movie theater operator in the U.S. with 7,315 screens in 561 theaters and is controlled by Phil Anschutz's Anschutz Corp. Mr. Anschutz, whose fortune Forbes estimates at more than $12 billion, was part of a consortium that took control of the then Regal Cinemas Inc. in 2001 after the chain entered chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Cineworld is the second-largest cinema business in Europe with 2,227 screens at 232 sites across nine countries.
The company will fund the acquisition through a mixture of debt and a £1.7 billion ($2.29 billion) equity fundraising. Its shares fell 3.5% in early trading in London.

HSBC,Asian Banking Gold Rush Might Yet Provide a Few Nuggets; The top dozen investment banks from the U.S. and Europe are better focused but losing revenue to regional rivals," Dec 6, 2017",0,"Big U.S. and European banks have dropped the ball in Asian investment banking--but that could be a good thing.
Asia has long been seen as the next big market for the world's megabanks. And indeed, it is. Fees for arranging debt and equity sales, making loans and advising on mergers and acquisitions has grown strongly since the end of 2014. Yet the biggest Western players as a group have gone backwards.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 946 of 1177
Big Chinese banks have expanded aggressively for some time, squeezing fee-levels to among the lowest in the world for some activities. Consequently, Western banks have struggled to generate profits.
But in the past three years, more U.S. and European players have abandoned Asia-wide ambitions. By the end of this year, the dozen biggest are likely to see their combined share drop to just 20% of industry revenue, down from nearly 40% in 2014, according to data from Coalition and Thomson Reuters.
Bank of America-Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs are two of the big names that have trimmed staff in the region in recent years , while Barclays cut back dramatically too. Some other banks are maintaining share: Citigroup is the only non-Chinese bank in the top-five for revenue over the first nine months of 2017, according to Thomson Reuters, while HSBC remains just outside it.
Some European banks have restructured their businesses and are trying to ensure they protect their positions at home. The big U.S. players have been consolidating their domestic dominance and taking share in Europe.
In Asia, most U.S. and European banks are now focused on certain types of client that have links with other businesses--for example rich private-bank clients for Credit Suisse and UBS, or expertise in serving global corporations that bring trade finance and cash management business for the likes of Citigroup, HSBC and JP Morgan. That focus, and lower costs, could help the bottom line.
Western banks spent years planting flags around the Asia. They loaded up on costs but struggled to turn any kind of profit. The retrenchment of the past couple of years might mean they can turn that record around.

HSBC,"Citi Hires Investment Banking Head for Saudi Arabia; Majed Al Hassoun, who will be based in Riyadh, will focus on public-sector and large domestic companies"," Dec 6, 2017",1,"
Citigroup Inc. has hired a new head of investment banking for Saudi Arabia as the U.S. bank prepares to launch operations in the kingdom next year.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 948 of 1177
Mr. Majed Al Hassoun, who will be based in Riyadh, initially will build up the operation to focus on working with public-sector entities in Saudi Arabia and large domestic and multinational companies. Citigroup expects to add up to 20 employees, including investment bankers, institutional debt and equity traders and stock-research analysts over time.
Mr. Al Hassoun will report to Carmen Haddad, who was appointed chief executive of Citigroup's business in Saudi Arabia earlier this year. Mr. Hassoun was previously a director at Saudi Fransi Capital, the investment banking arm of Riyadh-based Banque Saudi Fransi.
Citigroup's expansion plans in Saudi Arabia follow a 13-year absence from the country. The return highlights the opportunities that the bank and its rivals expect as a result of Saudi Arabia's plans to diversify its economy away from oil, using funds of up to $100 billion that it expects to raise from the planned initial public offering next year of the country's state-owned oil company Saudi Arabian Oil Co., or Saudi Aramco.
Some international banks are already benefiting from Saudi Arabia's efforts to raise funding internationally. In September, the Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabia's ministry of finance hired U.S. banks JP Morgan Chase &C0. and Goldman Sachs, Bahrain-based Gulf International Bank, U.K.-based HSBC and Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. to lead the country's recent international bond sale .
Still the bank's plan isn't without risk as highlighted by the government's recent anticorruption crackdown and continued uncertainty over Aramco's IPO.
Last month, the Saudi government detained more than 200 people including government officials, prominent businessmen and members of the country's ruling family. However, the recent release of several of the suspects shows that the crackdown is reaching a resolution .
Saudi Arabia has said its IPO plan for Aramco remains on track, however, the kingdom hasn't finalized on which exchanges to list shares of the energy giant.
Citigroup secured in April a banking license to operate in Saudi Arabia. It will allow the bank to advise companies on dealmaking, to underwrite and sell debt and equity securities, and to provide stock research for its corporate and institutional clients.

HSBC,HSBC's Second-Largest Shareholder Is Now From China; U.K.-based lender says Ping An Insurance won't influence its operations," Dec 7, 2017",0,"One of China's biggest insurers has become the second-largest shareholder of HSBC Holdings PLC, but it won't influence how the U.K.-based bank is run, HSBC's departing Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver said Thursday.
Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. of China Ltd.'s investment is a financial move and not a strategic one, Mr. Gulliver told reporters at an event in Shenzhen, after the Chinese insurer said late Wednesday that its stake in HSBC rose to more than 5%.
Mr. Gulliver said the bank welcomed the investment and had been having regular conversations with Ping An, which began building its stake in the second quarter of last year. The investment by Ping An's asset-management unit, which wasn't funded by the insurer's equity, makes Ping An HSBC's second-largest shareholder after BlackRock Inc.
The world's largest insurer by market capitalization said it bought a total of 1.02 billion HSBC shares through the southbound Stock Connect program, which allows mainland Chinese companies to buy Hong Kong-listed shares. Ping An said the investment was driven by HSBC's dividends and reflects its principle of matching assets and liabilities.
The investment also marks a reversal of Ping An's ties with HSBC, which in 2012 sold its 15.6% stake in the insurer to a conglomerate controlled by Thai tycoon Dhanin Chearavanont for $9.39 billion.
Mr. Gulliver also outlined HSBC's growth plans for southern China's Pearl River Delta region, which is the focus of the bank's Asia strategy. HSBC plans to employ about 5,000 staff at its branches in Guangdong province by 2020, more than double its current head count.
Separately, HSBC will boost head count at its newly established securities joint-venture in China to about 300 employees, from about 100 currently. The joint venture with Qianhai Financial Holdings Co., in which HSBC owns a 51% stake, allows the bank to underwrite initial public offerings and trade securities and bonds.
The planned expansion in China is part of the bank's pivot to Asia announced in 2015. Mr. Gulliver said he expects the Pearl River Delta region to add $1 billion in profit before tax in the next five years, and generate annual profit before tax of $500 million subsequently.
HSBC Qianhai Securities Ltd. is expected to provide a positive return on equity in five years, Mr. Gulliver said during the joint-venture's launch Thursday, but declined to provide figures.
HSBC was the first foreign bank to win approval to operate a majority-owned joint-venture securities company in China. It did so under a special arrangement for Hong Kong-funded financial institutions. Last month, however, Chinese authorities said all foreign companies would be allowed to hold majority stakes in Chinese securities firms , a move long awaited by Wall Street.
Mr. Gulliver brushed off suggestions of emerging competition from Western banks, saying HSBC has a head start in getting its joint venture off the ground and hiring staff.

HSBC,"U.S. Stocks Rise Ahead of Central Bank Meetings; Shares of energy companies lead advances, while bitcoin futures jump in their trading debut"," Dec 11, 2017",1,"Rising technology and energy shares pushed the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average to records Monday ahead of a series of central bank meetings this week.
Stock moves were muted, with major indexes trading in a narrow range shortly after the opening bell and then edging higher in the afternoon.
Some investors said there were likely to be few swings in the market ahead of an meeting of the Federal Reserve. With many expecting the central bank to announce an interest-rate increase Wednesday, investors said they will be focused on parsing the Fed's economic and rates projections for 2018.
""There is broad disagreement in the market right now in terms of the number of rate hikes in 2018,"" said Anik Sen, global head of equities at PineBridge Investments. Although the backdrop for stocks looks positive heading into the new year, a pickup in inflation that spurs the Fed to raise rates more quickly than expected could pressure the stock rally, Mr. Sen said.
The S&P 500 climbed 8.49 points, or 0.3%, to 2659.99, notching its 59th record close of the year. The Nasdaq Composite rose 35 points, or 0.5%, to 6875.08, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 56.87 points, or 0.2%, to 24386.03, posting its 66th closing high of the year.
Shares of oil-and-gas companies led advances in the S&P 500, rallying as U.S. crude oil futures notched their third consecutive session of gains. The S&P 500 energy sector rose 0.7%, while U.S. crude for January delivery rose 1.1% to $57.99 a barrel, its fifth highest settlement of the year.
Shares of financial and industrial companies in the S&P 500 lagged behind, posting losses for the day.
Meanwhile, advances in technology shares lifted the Nasdaq past other major indexes, with Apple jumping $3.30, or 1.95%, to $172.67, and Nvidia up 3.17, or 1.7%, to 194.66.
The European Central Bank and Bank of England also hold policy meetings later this week. Few investors expect any changes to be announced at this juncture. Instead, analysts said, they will also watch for clues into their

analyses of the years ahead, with the ECB set to release forecasts for 2020 for the first time.
The Stoxx Europe 600 fell less than 0.1%, while London's export-heavy FTSE 100 rose 0.8%, among the biggest gainers in Europe.
Asian stocks mostly strengthened Monday after a quiet start, with the Shanghai Composite rising 1%. The Chinese central bank injected a net 20 billion yuan ($3.02 billion) into money markets Monday after draining liquidity for two weeks, providing a lift to stocks in China.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 1.1%, helped by gains in HSBC and Tencent. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average rose 0.6% to its highest close since January 1992.

HSBC,HSBC to Be Released From U.S. Deferred Prosecution Agreement; Controversial deal allowed the bank avoid criminal charges in 2012," Dec 11, 2017",0,"LONDON--HSBC Holdings PLC is to be released from a controversial agreement that let it avoid U.S. criminal charges in 2012, after it was judged to have sufficiently improved its systems to keep out financial criminals.
The expiration of the five-year deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Justice Department is a win for the bank and Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver, who had sought to have the case cleared before he retires in February. It also heralds the end of a contentious relationship between HSBC and an independent monitor installed at the bank as part of the settlement.
""HSBC lived up to all of its commitments, and, therefore, under the DPA, the Department of Justice will file a motion with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York seeking the dismissal of the charges deferred by the agreement,"" the bank said in a statement Monday.
The DOJ wasn't immediately available for comment.
Shares in the bank rose 2% in London in response to news the DPA, which could have been extended, was being lifted.

In December 2012, HSBC paid a then-record $1.9 billion to settle allegations it failed to spot the laundered proceeds of drug trafficking in Mexico, and that its employees stripped data from transactions involving sanctioned nations such as Iran to avoid detection.
HSBC admitted wrongdoing but avoided a guilty plea or prosecution of its executives, prompting widespread claims the bank was too big to jail.
A 2016 congressional report into the settlement found that Justice Department officials overruled internal recommendations to pursue a criminal prosecution, in part to avoid disrupting the global financial system. The DOJ at the time of the report said it was committed to holding individuals and corporations responsible for their conduct.
To qualify for the corporate probation in 2012, HSBC agreed to bolster its compliance controls, and has spent billions of dollars adding staff and standardizing and connecting its systems. It overhauled its executive team and corporate structure before the 2012 agreement, and tied annual bonuses for Mr. Gulliver and other executives to the compliance effort.
But failings in its systems continued to be found by the monitor , former prosecutor Michael Cherkasky, making it far from a given that HSBC's DPA would expire without an extension. The monitor's 2016 annual report to the DOJ found ""instances of potential financial crime"" and questioned whether HSBC was meeting all of its DPA obligations.
Standard Chartered, which entered shorter DPAs with the DOJ and the New York district attorney the same year over sanctions compliance, has had its agreements extended twice, most recently in November.
The monitorship turned out to be one of the toughest conditions of the agreement for HSBC, as hundreds of staff and consultants from Mr. Cherkasky's compliance firm, Exiger LLC, moved through HSBC's offices to assist with oversight and systems checks. The HSBC-Cherkasky relationship was almost immediately tense, people familiar with the matter said, with frequent clashes and frustration over the monitor's downbeat assessment of HSBC's progress
In the meantime, HSBC continued getting regulatory slaps over its anti-money laundering controls, and faced new allegations it let suspicious transactions slip through the net.
HSBC executives have said it is probably impossible to detect every instance of potentially illicit activity. Mr. Gulliver on Monday said the bank can combat financial crime much more effectively now because of the reforms it has made since 2012.
The monitor won't immediately exit HSBC, since the appointment under the DPA runs until July 2018. The monitor has also had an appointment since July 2013 with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority to assist the bank's compliance with U.K. rules around anti-money laundering, sanctions and terrorist financing.
The expiry of the DPA could have beneficial knock on effects for HSBC. Its finance head earlier this year said banking regulators likely have considered the DPA when deciding how much capital HSBC needs at its U.S. unit. HSBC has been using capital repatriated from the U.S. to buy back billions of dollars in shares.

HSBC,U.S. Dollar Firmer on Strong Data; Retail sales make strong showing and jobless claims fall as Fed continues to ratchet up interest rates," Dec 14, 2017",1,"
The U.S. dollar rose as data signaled the economy continues to grow amid the Federal Reserve's tightening interest-rate policy.
The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, gained for the eighth time in nine sessions, climbing 0.1% to 86.88.
Spending at stores, online-shopping websites and restaurants rose 0.8% in November from the prior month, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 0.3% increase. Retail sales increased 5.8% from November 2016.
Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs across the U.S., decreased by 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 225,000 in the week ended Dec. 9, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected 235,000 new claims last week.
""The dollar takes solace from confidence that growth is strong,"" said Daragh Maher, head of foreign-exchange strategy in the U.S. at HSBC. The dollar's gains were muted by the lack of inflation pressure, which has led to sluggish wage growth, Mr. Maher said.
The Fed on Wednesday raised its growth projections but left inflation forecasts unchanged. ""It could take a longer period of a very strong labor market in order to achieve the inflation objective"" of 2%, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said Wednesday at a press conference .
The dollar was bolstered after central banks in Europe showed continued caution about the region's economic recovery on Thursday, signaling that they are in no rush to follow the Federal Reserve in steadily raising interest rates despite a rare synchronized expansion across the world economy.
The European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged and said it will continue buying government bonds and other assets until September 2018, but at the reduced monthly rate of [euro]30 billion ($35.5 billion).
The central banks of Switzerland and Norway also left their key interest rates unchanged, and indicated that a first move to lift them back to levels that were considered normal before the global financial crisis is some way off.

HSBC,Dollar Scarcity Sends Global Funding Costs Soaring; Euro-dollar cross-currency basis swap has only been this far negative during periods of extreme stress," Dec 15, 2017",1,"
The cost of derivatives that allow global investors to access U.S. dollars has rocketed this week, with some reaching their steepest levels since the worst days of the eurozone sovereign-debt crisis.
A scarcity of dollars makes them more expensive to borrow, hurting non-U.S. banks and making a crucial form of credit harder to come by.
Rules designed to make finance safer have already made dollars scarcer, and the Federal Reserve is currently sucking dollars out of the financial system as it rolls back its monetary stimulus. Changes in U.S. tax law may compound the shortage.
The three-month euro-dollar cross-currency basis, where negative numbers denote higher dollar funding costs, dropped to minus 1.1 percentage points Friday, having been at minus 0.27 percentage point in mid-September.
The basis tends to widen toward the end of the year as banks scramble to adjust dollar-denominated liabilities and assets on their balance sheets. But many analysts are flagging the potential for continued strains on funding in the new year.
Though the move in the European market was most extreme, British and Japanese investors felt the squeeze too. The sterling and yen three-month cross-currency bases fell to minus 0.77 and 0.8 percentage point, respectively.
The euro basis swap has only been this low during periods of extreme stress. It broke below minus 1.5 percentage points in late 2008 during the financial crisis, and again in late 2011 during the sovereign-debt crisis.
Were greenbacks freely borrowed and lent, the spread would be around zero, economists say, as it generally was before the financial crisis.
HSBC named a scarcity of U.S. dollars overseas as one of their top 10 risks for the new year.
""Cross-currency basis swaps have already widened, but these swaps could go much deeper into negative territory if the dollar-funding squeeze becomes a structural issue next year,"" said HSBC analysts this week.
The scarcity reminds investors that they operate in a financial world dominated by one currency. That domination only increased after the global financial crisis in 2008, when new banking rules made U.S. banks less willing to expand their balance sheets and extend funding in currency swap markets, especially in December.
Commercial banks in Japan, Germany, France and the U.K. now have more dollar-denominated liabilities than those in their own currencies, according to data from the Bank for International Settlements.
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 964 of 1177
Even the year-end squeeze can have negative consequences for the firms that are active in the market. Very late in 2016, during the last signs of strain in the market, Socie?te? Ge?ne?rale SA recorded its worst trading day of the year, which it attributed to the sudden shift in the market.
""My first take on this a week or two ago was that a lot of the stress was just people preparing for the end of the year earlier,"" Lyn Graham-Taylor, senior rates strategist at Rabobank. ""But now it does look pretty bad.""
The scarcity is having other effects, boosting some markets.
The widening of the basis swap makes it more lucrative for any U.S. investors who can expand their balance sheets to buy euro-denominated assets, given banks are so keen to get their hands on their dollars. As a result, the eurozone's safest short-dated bonds have rallied in recent weeks.
Yields on Germany's three-month government debt fell to as little as minus 0.96% this week, the lowest on record, according to FactSet. Bond yields fall as prices rise.
Several factors could continue to make dollar swaps expensive for European investors, according to analysts.
The final U.S. tax overhaul bill could encourage repatriation of U.S. companies' overseas dollar investments to the U.S., removing a source of funding for Europe. Likewise, the Fed's balance sheet shrinkage reduces the pool of reserves that have lubricated foreign-exchange markets since the financial crisis.
""It's a persistent issue that's the result of the supply and demand for dollars,"" said Alessio de Longis, portfolio manager at OppenheimerFunds. ""If as a result of tax reform you see that repatriation of dollars on the part of large multinationals, it would remove even more from those international markets.""
Emerging markets are even more exposed to the U.S. dollar than advanced economies like the eurozone.
Research published by the Bank of England on Friday noted that more international bank lending to emerging market firms, excluding banks, is done in dollars than all the other currencies of the world combined.
""The reliance on U.S. dollar funding has become increasingly marked for emerging markets since the global financial crisis in international debt markets,"" the research noted.

Declining shares of technology companies dragged down major indexes Tuesday, even as Republicans advanced their sweeping rewrite of the U.S. tax code.
After two consecutive sessions of gains for all three major indexes, investors paused Tuesday as House Republicans voted to approve the latest version of the overhaul as expected, analysts said. The bill has already helped send shares higher in recent sessions, building on the momentum stocks have enjoyed from another strong quarter of earnings and an expanding U.S. economy.
""The market had a little bit of excitement"" Monday as investors continued to price in the likelihood of Republicans completing their tax bill this year, said Tony Roth, chief investment officer for Wilmington Trust. ""It's taking a little bit of a breather as Congress works through its process and gets the bill to the president.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 37.45 points, or 0.2%, to 24754.75, while the S&P 500 fell 8.69 points, or 0.3%, to 2681.47. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 30.91 points, or 0.4%, to 6963.85.
While analysts say the tax bill is expected to boost profits among companies that pay relatively high effective tax rates, such as retailers, banks and other firms, tech companies aren't expected to benefit as much , since they tend to pay a lower tax bill than other industries.
Tech companies in the S&P 500 pay an effective tax rate of about 18%, according to data from FactSet.
Besides that, some investors are likely selling some of their tech holdings to reap year-end gains, analysts added, and are moving that money into sectors that have underperformed, such as energy and consumer staples.

The expected passage of the tax bill also contributed to a pullback in U.S. government bond prices. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was 2.464%, compared with 2.392% Monday. Yields rise as prices fall.
Bonds tumbled, and so did dividend-paying stocks such as utilities and telecommunications firms in the S&P 500. That offset gains among consumer staples and energy companies.
CVS Health rose 64 cents, or 0.9%, to 72.31, while Wal-Mart Stores gained 90 cents, or 0.9%, to 98.80. Among energy firms, Marathon Oil added 59 cents, or 3.8%, to 16.02, and Noble Energy rose 94 cents, or 3.6%, to 27.23.
After the market closed Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported the House would have to hold another vote Wednesday to approve the tax bill to avoid running afoul of the fast-track procedures that govern its passage.
The Senate was expected to vote on the bill Tuesday night.
""There'll be some movement the more likely it becomes,"" said Ben Laidler, global equities strategist at HSBC. ""The S&P's done well and that tells you it's not been priced in yet. The tax cuts could add 7% to large-cap earnings, double that to small-cap earnings.""

HSBC,"Tighter Security Mixes With Festive Spirit at German Christmas Markets This Year; Authorities step up oversight a year after terror attack in Berlin, but experts question just how much can be done"," Dec 19, 2017",1,"BERLIN--For decades, Germany's Christmas markets have featured mulled wine, carousels and hand-carved wood trinkets. This year, concrete blocks, surveillance cameras and plainclothes police officers also will be part of the scene, a year after a deadly attack here.
German authorities have stepped up security around the beloved seasonal festivals in a bid to prevent a repeat of last year's Berlin Christmas market attack that left 12 people dead.
But many security experts say the efforts may do little to deter attackers and could even increase casualties should things go wrong. In fact, they say, a genuine security upgrade for the country's galaxy of Christmas markets would be expensive, intrusive and might not work.
Take concrete barriers, said Chris Phillips, former head of the U.K.'s National Counter Terrorism Security Office. ""If a vehicle hits a block and the block explodes, it's extremely dangerous....Shards of flying concrete will kill people."" He said police are too focused on past threats instead of anticipating the militants' next moves. Islamic state fighters returning from Iraq and Syria, for instance, may try to replicate the truck and car bombs they used there.
""Historically, we've seen tactics used on battlefields move to urban environments,"" said Bruce Hoffman, director of security studies at Georgetown University's Walsh School of Foreign Service.
Germany's more-than-1,450 Christmas markets are big business, attracting at least 85 million visitors a year and generating sales of more than [euro]1 billion ($1.17 billion), according to the German Showmen's Association. Planning for markets in big cities like Berlin, Munich and Frankfurt takes months.
In a country that puts up heavy restrictions on the use of video surveillance, cameras are making their first appearances at several markets this year. Uniformed police armed with automatic pistols patrol the city center while undercover police mingle with the crowds, supported by private security guards.

Authorities and organizers fear a repeat of attacks in Paris, Brussels and Copenhagen, where marauding gunmen wreaked havoc. This month, police found a cache of nearly 200 bullets in a garage near a Christmas market in Berlin. A police spokeswoman said no arrests have been made and an investigation is continuing.
Heavily armed helicopter SWAT teams are on standby in barracks across Germany.
In the past, authorities resisted tighter security, arguing they would cause unnecessary alarm. This changed Dec. 19, 2016, when Anis Amri, a rejected asylum seeker from Tunisia, drug dealer and known radical, plowed a hijacked truck into a Christmas market on Breitscheidplatz, near the Berlin Zoo.
Cologne's main Christmas market no longer allows revelers to bring rucksacks or suitcases. Roads through Frankfurt's main city center are blocked by checkpoints, parked vans and two-deep rows of concrete blocks.
""There are police here. There are no vehicles,"" said Len Doucette, a 68-year-old retired Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer from Ottawa, Ontario, sightseeing at a Frankfurt Christmas market with friends. ""I feel very safe.""
Stephan Borghorst, a 49-year-old researcher at the German parliament, was philosophical about the risks while strolling through a Berlin market.
""The probability of being killed in a terrorist attack is about the same as being stuck by lightning,"" he said. ""I'm not going to hide at home.""
German cities could follow the lead of New York and London and turn to permanent antitruck defenses disguised as street furniture, including crash-resistant bollards, sculptures and benches, Mr. Phillips said.
Encircling markets would be the best way of protecting them, Mr. Hoffman said. A more-intrusive option would be airport-style security checkpoints.
Organizers say such measures would cost too much and kill the spirit of markets that typically sprawl across city centers. Even unassuming barriers masquerading as street furniture would block city streets for the 11 months of the year when the markets don't operate.
Retractable bollards would have stopped last year's rampage and still allowed traffic to flow freely for the remainder of the year. The British Embassy in Berlin has been shielded by such bollards since a 2003 truck-bomb attack on the British consulate and HSBC headquarters in Istanbul that killed 30 people.
But at a cost of as much as £12,000 ($15,986) per bollard, according to their British manufacturer ATG Access, they are too expensive for most of Germany's small Christmas markets, organizers said. Fortifying the 200-yard north and south flanks of Berlin's Breitscheidplatz would cost well over [euro]2 million.
That is too much for the market organizers, who have asked Berlin's city council to help cover this year's additional security costs.
In Lu?beck on Germany's Baltic coast, organizers spent [euro]20,000 on 80 bags of sand and gravel, which they painted to look ""Christmassy,"" a spokeswoman for the market said.

HSBC,A Massive Margin Loan That Went Really Wrong for the Banks; Steinhoff International's share collapse shows the dangers for banks in the fast-growing stock-based lending business," Dec 19, 2017",1,"Lending to the wealthy against equity holdings is rated as surprisingly low-risk by banks. But when it goes wrong, it goes really wrong. Just look at scandal-hit Steinhoff International.
A [euro]1.6 billion share-backed loan to Steinhoff's recently departed chairman, Christo Wiese, is so far underwater that the banks will need a bathysphere to recover any value. Shares in the global retail group, which owns Mattress Firm and the Sleepy's brand, collapsed suddenly when the company disclosed accounting irregularities this month.
Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and Nomura put together the original loan, but have since sold off large chunks to several other banks including Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, which has the largest exposure, and BNP Paribas.
The losses may be a small part of the banks' overall businesses, but they look big enough that for many of the lenders they could wipe out all revenue from stock-based lending this year. It is a business that had been booming due to the long, low-volatility stock rally and the loans' light capital requirements: regulators assess margin lending on liquid, public equities as less risky than mortgages.
This loan was made to a vehicle controlled by Mr. Wiese in September 2016 to help him fund a Steinhoff capital raising needed to pay for one of its many acquisitions. Mr. Wiese's vehicles pledged 628 million shares--at that point worth [euro]3.175 billion ($3.75 billion)--as collateral against the loan. In essence, he borrowed against his Steinhoff shares to buy more Steinhoff shares.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 976 of 1177
The losses these lenders face are so large because the downfall came so suddenly. Normally banks can make margin calls, asking for cash or more stock, to protect their position. With Steinhoff, the shares were worth 120% of the loan on Dec. 5 and less than 24% 48 hours later. They are now worth less than 20%.
Lenders have recovered a tiny fraction of the value by selling 98 million, or 15%, of the pledged shares last week. But it isn't obvious that they should just sell the rest.
Banks have to assess what Mr. Wiese and the company is worth in terms of revenues from other existing or future business before seizing and selling all the collateral. And they need a better idea of whether Steinhoff is worth more than its substantial debts, to which some of the banks also have exposure.
The company's banks met with management on Tuesday afternoon to work out whether or how it can be helped. Just before the meeting, Steinhoff said it didn't know when it would be able to publish its annual results, which were due when the scandal broke, or how big the accounting irregularities could turn out to be. It also said that lenders were already freezing or withdrawing credit lines from its subsidiaries.
What its lenders decide after the meeting will have a direct bearing on whether its shares recover much value from here or not.
This will be a fascinating multiplayer game where each bank has to judge whether the best value lies in cooperating with their client and peers or acting aggressively to recover what it can quickly. Right now it is hard to see the game producing any winners.

HSBC,Gold Prices Inch Lower Ahead of Tax-Bill Vote; Traders closely monitoring moves in the dollar," Dec 19, 2017",1,"Gold prices were slightly lower Tuesday, closely tracking the dollar ahead of a House of Representatives vote on a tax-overhaul bill .
Gold for February delivery inched down 0.1% to $1,264.20 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange to end a four-session winning streak.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 978 of 1177
The House passed the tax overhaul 227 to 203, and the Senate will vote later Tuesday.
Prices have rebounded in recent sessions since hitting their lowest level since July last week before the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the third time this year . Gold struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets like Treasurys as borrowing costs rise.
Traders have also been closely monitoring moves in the dollar, as a stronger U.S. currency makes gold and other dollar-denominated commodities for expensive for overseas buyers. The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of 16 other currencies, was little changed Tuesday.
Some analysts have said lawmakers passing the GOP tax plan could lead to a swing in the dollar.
""If it inspires a re-ignition or revival of the Trump reflation trade, it's possible the gold market comes under a little pressure,"" said James Steel, chief precious metals analyst at HSBC.
Gold prices are back near their November trading range , up nearly 10% for the year but roughly 6.5% off their year- to-date highs from early September.
Analysts have said geopolitical uncertainty and hesitation among Fed officials about a gradual pace of interest- rate increases could continue to support gold prices. Many investors favor gold and other haven assets when they believe markets might turn rocky.
And although the Fed stuck to its forecast for three more rate increases in 2018, some analysts had expected a more aggressive stance and higher inflation projections. Weak inflation has raised doubts about the central bank's plans moving forward throughout the year.
""It certainly could have been much more hawkish and therefore bearish for gold,"" Mr. Steel said.
Among base metals, copper for March delivery swung between small gains and losses and closed up 0.2% at $3.1515 a pound after rising for a 10th straight session. The industrial metal sits near three-year highs , boosted by favorable demand from China, the world's largest consumer, and supply disruptions.

HSBC,Tech Sector Leads Stocks Lower; Investors pause as GOP tax overhaul makes its way through Congress," Dec 20, 2017",0,"* Dow industrials, S&P and Nasdaq fall
* Tech companies weigh on indexes
* Investors await crucial tax votes
Declining shares of technology companies dragged down major indexes Tuesday, even as Republicans advanced their sweeping rewrite of the U.S. tax code.
After two consecutive sessions of gains for all three major indexes, investors paused Tuesday as House Republicans voted to approve the latest version of the overhaul as expected, analysts said. The bill has already helped send shares higher in recent sessions, building on the momentum stocks have enjoyed from another strong quarter of earnings and an expanding U.S. economy.
""The market had a little bit of excitement"" Monday as investors continued to price in the likelihood of Republicans completing their tax bill this year, said Tony Roth, chief investment officer for Wilmington Trust. ""It's taking a little bit of a breather as Congress works through its process and gets the bill to the president.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 37.45 points, or 0.2%, to 24754.75, while the S&P 500 fell 8.69 points, or 0.3%, to 2681.47. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 30.91 points, or 0.4%, to 6963.85.
While analysts say the tax bill is expected to boost profits among companies that pay relatively high effective tax rates, such as retailers, banks and other firms, tech companies aren't expected to benefit as much , since they tend to pay a lower tax bill than other industries.
Tech companies in the S&P 500 pay an effective tax rate of about 18%, according to data from FactSet.
Besides that, some investors are likely selling some of their tech holdings to reap year-end gains, analysts added, and are moving that money into sectors that have underperformed, such as energy and consumer staples.

Hedge funds and other active managers had a much better 2017 than many anticipated a year ago.
Hedge funds held their own and even posted their best relative performance in a rising equity market in almost a decade. There is still a lot of pressure on the business, especially when it comes to its historically high fees, but only a few large shops closed their doors in 2017.
As for other active managers, rising markets helped mitigate the pain of continued outflows from stock funds and some managers posted comebacks against their benchmarks. Broadly, however, nothing in the past 12 months has stopped the rise of passive investing.
As 2018 starts, here are the money managers and executives to watch:
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 991 of 1177
Abigail Johnson
One of the most senior women in asset management, Fidelity Investments' Chief Executive Abigail Johnson is leading the money-management and brokerage giant as both industries confront unprecedented cost pressures from the rise of low-cost index-tracking funds.
Under Ms. Johnson's leadership, the Boston-based firm has pushed further into exchange-traded funds, a type of product executives at the firm have long viewed as less important than traditional actively managed mutual funds. Fidelity also cut trading commissions in its brokerage business in early 2017 in a bid to capture more client assets flowing into ETFs. These are both passive plays.
Assets under administration at Fidelity rose 18% from the end of 2016 to $6.7 trillion at the end of November, while assets under management climbed to $2.43 trillion from $2.13 trillion at the end of 2016.
""We saw very strong operating income and revenue in 2016, and that trend continued in 2017 as well,"" a company spokesman said on her behalf.
Ms. Johnson has rarely made public speeches since succeeding her father as chief executive in 2014 and chairman in 2016, but over the past year she has stepped into the spotlight to discuss emerging technology in financial markets. In one 2017 speech she championed the prospects of bitcoin and other alternative currencies, an unusual stance for the head of a large financial services company, and in another discussed promise of artificial intelligence in financial planning and asset management.
""I'd like to think that huge new markets and products are going to be built on these open platforms,"" she said. ""Blockchain technology isn't just a more efficient way to settle transactions, it can fundamentally change market structures and perhaps even the architecture of the internet itself.""
Her challenge is balancing Fidelity's investments in those technologies with pricing pressures in other well- established corners of its business. The company in February offered its first ever large-scale voluntary staff buyouts to 3,000 of its longer-tenured workers in 2017.
More recently, Ms. Johnson has had to respond to allegations of sexual harassment at the firm. That led to the departure of one of its star stock pickers and prompted the firm to hire a consultant to review workplace conduct and create a sexual-harassment task force.
-- Sarah Krouse Jeffrey Gundlach
As bond investors prepare for a more challenging environment, all eyes are on how Jeffrey Gundlach will handle the new market.
Mr. Gundlach's DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund grew to $62 billion over its first six years, thanks to years of outsize performance, gaining Mr. Gundlach widespread recognition as ""the new bond king."" But after peaking in September 2016, the fund dropped to nearly $54 billion by the end of November 2017, even after adding nearly $500 million over the past two months, according to Morningstar Direct. Mr. Gundlach says his firm "" had a record
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 992 of 1177

year"" in inflows and performance for investors.
The DoubleLine fund gained 3.5% for the year through Dec. 26, compared with 3.38% for the average fund in the category, putting it in the 44th percentile for the year, Morningstar says.
Amid growing indications that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates, short-term Treasurys came under pressure in 2017, with the yield on two-year notes climbing to 1.87% from 1.19%. But yields on 10-year Treasurys barely moved, trading at 2.49% this week, raising questions about whether this ""flattening"" of the yield curve suggests an economic downturn is around the bend.
Mr. Gundlach, who didn't reply to a request for comment, has told investors he and his team don't see a recession in the offing, and on Twitter he warned of a possible ""disaster"" for corporate bonds when interest rates rise.
""The U.S. bond market setup hasn't been this interesting in years,"" he tweeted on Dec. 18. -- Gregory Zuckerman
David Einhorn
Hedge-fund manager David Einhorn has fallen on tough times.
The stock picker has lost more than 10% since 2014, compared with a 38% total return in the S&P 500. His Greenlight Capital Inc. rose 2% in 2017, while the S&P 500 climbed 20.5%.
Greenlight paid out more than $400 million to clients who chose to cash out midyear, helping shrink the firm to $7 billion in assets under management. More money was expected to flow out at year-end, said people familiar with the matter.
Mr. Einhorn shot to fame during the financial crisis with a prescient call against Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. He is a value investor known for making lengthy presentations critical of companies, complete with cartoons, puns and video clips.
The 49-year-old Mr. Einhorn is far from the only fundamentally oriented investor who has lost his footing in recent years, raising questions about whether the rise of algorithmic trading and passive investing have changed their prospects.
In 2017 alone, Eric Mindich and John Griffin said they were closing their shops, the $7 billion Eton Park Capital Management LP and the $6 billion Blue Ridge Capital, respectively. Both were under their high-water marks, or the point at which investment gains make up for returns, said people familiar with the matter.

When Qi Wang arrived at Pacific Investment Management Co., she inherited one of the toughest seats at the firm-- in more ways than one.
Pimco hired Ms. Wang in 2010 to co-manage its hedge fund that places bets based on sweeping views on
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 993 of 1177

economic policy and geopolitics--an investment strategy blunted by low interest rates and serene markets. What's more, her desk at the California bond manager sat next to Bill Gross, the famously hard-charging investment chief whose 2014 exit sent shock waves through Wall Street.
The 44-year-old manager appears to have succeeded: She now oversees some $7.5 billion in hedge-fund investments at Pimco.
A difficult stretch for so-called global macro hedge funds like Ms. Wang's Pimco Absolute Return Strategy has forced some to lower fees amid meager returns. According to HFR, macro hedge funds have produced an average return of just 1.6% in 2017 through November.
Ms. Wang, who spent 12 years at hedge-fund firm HBK Capital Management before joining Pimco, has fared better. One of her PARS funds was up 3.5% through October, according to a recent HSBC hedge-fund performance report, in part because she bet on Emmanuel Macron's victory in the French presidential election this past May.
""I don't consider myself an old-style macro investor,"" she said. ""The toughest challenge for an investor, but especially a traditional macro investor, is to have the intellectual flexibility to understand the landscape has changed. You have to adjust.""
Dan Ivascyn, Pimco's investment chief, said two traits that have made Mr. Gross a successful investor--a prodigious work ethic and a willingness to hold colleagues to a high standard--have served Ms. Wang well, too. She also wasn't intimidated by Mr. Gross.""She's tough,"" Mr. Ivascyn said.
Mr. Gross's success had fascinated Ms. Wang, who wanted to learn how the bond investor was able to churn out solid returns even as his flagship mutual fund, Pimco Total Return, swelled to more than $200 billion in assets under management. When news broke that Pimco's macro hedge-fund manager had left the firm, she volunteered to step in.
""A light went on in my head,"" she told the Journal in December. ""That would be an interesting job for me: I could manage a hedge fund and sit next to Bill Gross.""

ASTHMA SUFFERERS COULD SOON GET BREATHing room in their budgets. Advair, the world's topselling respiratory drug, will probably face generic competition in the U.S. beginning in 2018. It's the biggest moneymaker for United Kingdom- based GlaxoSmithKline, whose earnings estimates have been sliding, and whose shares have tumbled since the summer.
Now looks like a good time to buy Glaxo stock. To see why, look back to Pfizer (ticker: PFE) seven years ago, on the eve of Lipitor's patent expiration. The cholesterol pill was a massive seller, with $149 billion in lifetime sales, compared with $108 billion for Advair. From the end of 2010, Pfizer's earnings per share effectively didn't grow for five years. Yet shareholders made 120% over that stretch, and not just because of a broad rise in the stock market. As Pfizer gradually worked its way back toward growth, investors lost some of their disdain for the shares. Relative to earnings, the stock went from being 40% cheaper than the U.S. market to 15% cheaper. Healthy dividends added to the gains.
The setup is similar for Glaxo (GSK). Its shares have slid from $44 to a recent $35 and change since summer, putting them at 12.5 times next year's projected earnings. That's a discount of 32% to the U.S. market and 15% to the U.K. The dividend yield is 5.6%. Glaxo's growth slump looks likely to last just two years, in part because it's less dependant on Advair than Pfizer was on Lipitor at the peak. If shares gradually return to 15 times forward earnings estimates-where they traded as recently as June-investors stand to make more than 40% over the next two years, including dividends.

Advair combines a long-acting bronchodilator to open breathing passages with a steroid to keep them free from inflammation. It's used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, a broad term for progressive diseases like emphysema and chronic bronchitis.
The drug has been off-patent since 2016, and compared with complex biologics, it's a simple chemical compound. But the delivery is tricky. Advair is commonly taken using a device called Diskus, which repeatedly punctures a blister pack of powder for inhalation. Generic challengers have had a bear of a time proving they can duplicate Advair's dosage because, studies suggest, Advair itself isn't especially precise in the amount of medicine that makes its way to patients' lungs.
Generics are coming, however, and the first to market could be an early laggard. Novartis (NVS), through its Sandoz unit, was once so far behind Mylan (MYL) and Hikma Pharmaceuticals (HIK.UK.) in the race to copy Advair that it filed a citizen petition asking the Food and Drug Administration for stricter approval standards. Although the FDA denied the petition, the regulator has held up generics from Mylan and Hikma, which could put Novartis in the lead. Glaxo expects a 15% to 20% revenue decline for Advair in 2018.
Why not more? One reason is that Advair prices have already been falling; the drug's revenue declined 13% last quarter. Partly this is due to pressure from drug plans. Advair can cost more than $300 for a 30-day supply without a drug plan, or $55 for a 90-day supply with a drug plan, judging by recent prices at GoodRX.com and Caremark.com.
There is also competitive pressure, even without a generic substitute. In May, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) simultaneously launched AirDuo Respi- Click and its own generic. It uses the same two drugs as Advair, but in a different mix and with a different device, and so far it's approved for asthma but not COPD. In November, Novartis released data showing that its steroid-free combo treatment for COPD, called Ultibro Breezhaler, works better than the main ingredients in Advair, the company says.
Glaxo, however, already makes its own steroid-free inhaler, and a three-drug combo, and much more, as part of a respiratory portfolio that includes Advair. Last quarter, total company revenue was 7.8 billion pounds ($10.54 billion), up 4%. Of that, pharmaceutical sales were £4.2 billion, up 3%. Within pharma, respiratory sales grew 1%, to £1.6 billion. Advair sales were £743 million, or less than 10% of company revenue. That compares with 16% for Pfizer's Lipitor seven years ago. According to UBS analyst Michael Leuchten, Glaxo looks likely to grow its respiratory revenues organically by 1% a year through 2022, even as Advair revenue falls.
In a sweeping asset swap with Novartis in 2015, Glaxo gave up some of its cancer drugs and gained vaccines and consumer products. Its brands now include Excedrin, Theraflu, Sensodyne, Tums, and Flonase. Such products carry lower margins than cancer drugs, of course, but they help offset Glaxo's risk from drug-pricing pressure and the trend toward consumer-driven health care, which favors over-the-counter medicines.
In April 2017, Emma Walmsley took over as chief executive at Glaxo, and she has been frank about the company's shortcomings. Relative to its peers, Glaxo has taken too long to develop new drugs, and launched too many that don't sell well. Walmsley is stopping more than a dozen clinical programs and says she will focus 80% of spending on four core areas, immuno-inflammation, cancer, HIV, and respiratory, while reducing administrative and other costs by £1 billion a year by 2020. That will help fund more research and provide a larger free-cashflow cushion for the dividend. The goal is to grow earnings per share at a compounded rate in the mid- to highsingle digits over the next five years. That is presumably backloaded; Wall Street predicts negligible growth over the next two years

followed by a return to 7% growth.
A shingles vaccine looks like a hit. In HIV, Glaxo is poised to take market share from Gilead Sciences (GILD). In 2018, pivotal studies will begin on a drug for multiple myeloma, a blood cancer. HSBC analyst Steve McGarry calls the drug potentially transformative to Glaxo's growth, with a launch likely in 2020 and billions of dollars in sales. Before then, Advair will be old news and Glaxo shares could hit $47, 15 times the 2020 earnings consensus. That would work out to a 33% gain over two years-plus 11% for two years' of dividends. Enough to make shareholders feel much better."
HSBC,"Ripple Steals Bitcoin's Thunder, Surges 1,184% in a Month; The sudden jump has given the digital currency a virtual cash hoard worth $200 billion"," Jan 5, 2018",0,"In 2017, bitcoin became a household word among investors. This year, it may be Ripple's turn.
XRP, a five-year-old digital currency offered by the San Francisco startup Ripple, has soared 1,184% in the past month alone , quickly becoming the second-largest crypto-asset behind bitcoin and adding 42% in the first days of 2018.
Such moves have become almost normal in the tumultuous virtual-currency mania of the past year. Ripple, like a bevy of other crypto startups, has benefited from the blind hope many investors are placing in largely unregulated and loosely defined bitcoin-related business. What's surprising about Ripple, though, is some of the differences it has with bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency.
While both focus on electronic payments, bitcoin is governed by a fractious global array of technologists and antiestablishment libertarians. It was created nine years ago to reduce the power of big banks widely blamed for the financial crisis.
XRP on the other hand is centralized around a single for-profit company, Ripple, that has courted banks with a promise to reduce their costs. While some banks like Spain's Banco Santander SA and Bank of America Corp. have signed up for Ripple's international money-transfer services, many large players such as Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings PLC have stayed away and are pursuing their own payment improvements.
Ripple hasn't disclosed how much money banks are moving over its payments network, which offers software to transfer dollars, yen and euros more quickly and inexpensively.

""It's amazing what's going on,"" said Chris Larsen, Ripple's co-founder and chairman. ""You've got to be standing in the middle of the road when the luck-truck hits you.""
A former online lending specialist who co-founded Prosper Marketplace Inc., Mr. Larsen owns roughly 5% of the outstanding XRP tokens, according to a person familiar with the company. That stake is now worth about $16 billion, at current market prices, up more than 500-fold from its $30 million value a year ago.
The huge rise shows that ""real utility matters,"" says Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. ""Real customers matter.""
Despite bitcoin's popularity among investors, its utility as a payments platform has suffered due to network delays and rising transaction costs . And many bankers still distrust bitcoin, with JPMorgan CEO James Dimon last year calling it ""a fraud.""
Ripple, meanwhile, has become a cash-flow positive, profitable business, according to Mr. Garlinghouse. That is a rarity among crypto startups, though a big part comes from the XRP sales themselves in addition to the fees Ripple generates by selling software licenses and collecting fees on individual money transfers.
Then there are the 61 billion tokens that Ripple owns and hasn't yet sold. Those have soared to a value worth about $200 billion. While the lofty sum could plummet at any time, it is still a staggering amount, greater than the cash hoards of nearly every company the S&P 500, including Microsoft Corp., which has $138 billion.
Also, since the XRP held by Ripple isn't easy to trade like a major currency, Ripple couldn't quickly convert major amounts of XRP to dollars without risking a crash in XRP's price, a possibility that has made some investors nervous.
To counter those criticisms, Ripple took 90% of its remaining XRP holdings, about 55 billion tokens, and put them in 55 separate contracts designed to prevent the company from tapping more than 1 billion tokens in any one month.
At the beginning of 2017, Mr. Garlinghouse, a 46-year-old former Yahoo and AOL executive, took over the CEO spot from Mr. Larsen, who remained chairman. The Topeka, Kan., native impressed Mr. Larsen with his blunt assessment of some of Yahoo's past problems.
Mr. Garlinghouse, who joined the company as president and chief operating officer in 2015, has a stake of about 6% in Ripple, according to a person familiar with the company.
Despite the surge in XRP's value, Ripple, like all crypto companies, carries big questions. One is whether more banks will adopt it instead of choosing payment projects where they have more control and a greater stake. There are also well-funded startups, including R3 and Digital Asset Holdings, which recently scored a contract from Australian exchange operator ASX Ltd.

HSBC,Brexit Prompts Bank Scramble to Secure Private School Seats; Goldman Sachs and other lenders maneuver to place the children of their star bankers in Europe's top schools," Jan 6, 2018",1,"
For months the Frankfurt International School has been fielding phone calls from some of the world's biggest banks trying to enroll the children of their top earners.
The lenders--under pressure to relocate staff to Frankfurt in the wake of the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union--are counting on the English-language day school to expand its roughly 1,800-student enrollment, but headmaster Paul Fochtman is playing hardball.
""We will not get distracted by Brexit,"" he said. ""We are happy with our current size.""
Banks are still in the early stages of selecting staff to relocate to the Continent as Brexit negotiations lumber toward a March 2019 deadline. But their hunt for elite private schools already has begun.
Admission for the 2018-2019 academic year is under way, and the finance industry wants the finest education money can buy in Europe. Bankers also want it in their lingua franca, English.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1008 of 1177
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has paid extra fees to secure 80 seats for the children of staff at schools across Frankfurt, according to a person familiar with the matter. HSBC Holdings PLC is angling for first-mover advantage in Paris, where the British bank is in talks with several top schools, according to people familiar with the matter.
School administrators say some banks are paying full tuition upfront, before staff and their families have even decided to move.
That doesn't mean schools in cities like Frankfurt, the German financial capital drawing the bulk of the Brexit exodus, are rolling out the welcome mat. Schools across Europe are reluctant to bend admissions rules to accommodate bankers' children. Many don't want to invest in enlarging enrollment, citing uncertainty over the outcome of Brexit negotiations.
""If banks aren't in contact with our school right now, they are going to experience difficulties for fall 2018 entrance,"" Mr. Fochtman said.
The risk of a schooling shortage has banks in a bind. The U.K. could lose 30,000 finance sector jobs as a result of Brexit to cities such as Frankfurt and Amsterdam, according to Brussels-based think tank Bruegel. Those midsize cities, however, lack the array of schooling options that many bankers have come to expect from London.
Deutsche Bank AG Chief Executive John Cryan told a conference in Frankfurt in September that the bank's hometown was lagging behind London in its offering of schools and other services. The Frankfurt-based lender has about 8,000 employees in the U.K.
""This is where Germany needs to catch up if it wants to take over a large share of the business performed in London,"" Mr. Cryan said at a conference in the German city.
Eric Menges, head of FrankfurtRheinMain GmbH, a government-backed agency that promotes Frankfurt, said the city's private schools will build extra capacity if they get assurances the inflow of Brexit-related children is significant. Right now, he said, the city's international schools have enough room to accommodate the early arrivals.
Frankfurt International's Mr. Fochtman said lenders approaching the school now about Brexit-related students are already tardy. Every year, the school sets aside 10% of its 350-500 available seats for companies that pay a special ""partnership"" fee to the school. But vacancies under that program have already been filled for the next academic year, he said.
Seven miles south, the Metropolitan School Frankfurt, a modern, bright yellow building in a quiet, middle-class district, has blocked seats for banks that have agreed to pay tuition of up to 14,300 euros ($16,854) for the academic year, said Peter Ferres, a former investment banker who founded the school in 2007.
The International School of Amsterdam, founded in 1964 by a local director of International Business Machines Corp., also has received many inquiries from financial institutions, said school director Edward Greene. But Mr. Greene isn't keen on partnering with companies.
""We're not convinced it's the right way forward,"" said Mr. Greene. ""If we offer 45 seats, they aren't available to others,"" he said.

In Paris, which boasts a wide selection of international schools, HSBC has fanned out, entering talks with several schools, according to people familiar with the matter.
One is the exclusive International School of Paris, located a stone's throw from the Eiffel Tower. The school, which currently has 700 students from kindergarten to high school, plans to open a third campus next year to accommodate another 300 children.
But Brexit-related students aren't getting special treatment. They need to submit school records, recommendation letters and a [euro]900 nonrefundable application fee. Then there is tuition of up to [euro]31,600 a year, depending on the child's age, as well as a [euro]9,000 entry fee.
""We will have capacity to meet higher demand,"" said headmaster Simon Murray. ""But they will still need to go through our admission process,"" he said.

HSBC,Tencent Joins Asia-Tech Debt Rush With Its Biggest Bond Sale; The internet giant is following similar moves by peers that have had a meteoric rise in market capitalization," Jan 12, 2018",0,"Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s visit to the bond market this week marked the latest in a string of Asian technology firms that have been issuing more debt as their market values have swelled.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1013 of 1177
Tencent, which owns the popular messaging service WeChat and is one of the world's largest videogame publishers, on Thursday priced $5 billion in U.S.-dollar bonds that mature in five, 10 and 20 years--its largest-ever bond sale.
The Shenzhen-based company last issued bonds about three years ago. At that time, it priced its 10-year bonds at 2.05 percentage point above U.S. Treasury yields, or 3.8%. This time it paid lower rates to borrow: Its 10-year bonds were priced at 1.05 percentage point above U.S. Treasury yields, or 3.595%.
Strong investor demand also allowed Tencent to price its 20-year bonds to yield under 4% a year, locking in low long-term interest rates. The offering also included five-year floating rate notes that were priced at 0.6 percentage point above the three-month London interbank offered rate, according to a banker on the deal. That Libor benchmark was recently 1.7%.
Tencent's debt sale came about a month after Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. issued $7 billion in bonds with maturities ranging from 5.5 to 40 years. Other Asian tech issuers in the last year included Baidu Inc. and Lenovo Group Ltd., according to data provider Dealogic.
Together, the bond offerings reflect the growing significance of corporate bond issuers in Asia, particularly from China. Chinese tech companies issued $12.1 billion in dollar bonds in 2017, more than four times as much as the year before, according to Dealogic. Outside of the banking sector, only real-estate companies and so-called holding companies--often known as conglomerates--issued more debt from China.
Chinese real-estate companies issued $27 billion in bonds last year, nearly three times as much as a year ago, while conglomerates raised about $13 billion, nearly 2.5 times their 2016 fundraising. Overall, Chinese companies raised $118 billion in bonds last year.
In the past few years, Asian tech companies have seen a meteoric rise in their market capitalization. At the same time, their debt levels have remained relatively low, giving them room to raise more funds from the bond markets. Shares of Tencent and Alibaba roughly doubled last year.
In doing so, Chinese tech firms are following the lead of Apple Inc., the world's largest tech company by market value, which has issued billions of dollars worth of bonds in recent years despite having a sizable cash balance.
""These companies seem to be taking advantage of the strong (bond) markets at the moment,"" said Luther Chai, a research analyst from CreditSights in Singapore.
Bond markets have been on a tear in the past year as investors have rushed to buy debt issued by companies, particularly those in Asia. Thanks to this strong demand, the cost of borrowing money using bonds is now around its lowest in many years.
Like its Asian peers, Tencent is likely to use the funds raised to partially repay its existing debt and for future acquisitions. The company has $3 billion of debt maturing during the first three quarters of 2018, Mr. Chai noted in a research note earlier this week. Tencent already owns stakes in prominent overseas companies including Snap Inc., Tesla Inc. and Spotify AB.
As with Alibaba's offering, Tencent's bond offering received a positive response from investors in the U.S. who

placed nearly half of the roughly $42 billion in orders for the deal, according to a person familiar with the matter. Tencent's bonds are expected to be rated A2 by Moody's, a notch below those of Alibaba.
The bond offering followed two days of meetings with investors in Asia, Europe and the U.S. via 14 banks including Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and HSBC Holdings PLC.

The fines relate to deficiencies regulators saw in the wake of a meltdown in the U.S. housing market around the 2008-09 financial crisis. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was fined $14 million, Morgan Stanley $8 million, CIT Group Inc. $5.2 million, U.S. Bancorp $4.4 million and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. $3.5 million.

HSBC,Pension Sues Canadian Banks Alleging Manipulation of Rate; Fund alleges 'unlawful conspiracy' to boost derivatives trading," Jan 16, 2018",0,"TORONTO--A Colorado pension fund is suing Canada's top six banks and three other lenders for allegedly manipulating a key Canadian lending rate.
The Fire &Pension Association of Colorado filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan Friday and alleged the banks engaged in an ""unlawful conspiracy"" to boost their derivatives trading businesses by manipulating the Canadian dealer offered rate between 2007 and 2014.
The lawsuit names Canada's largest banks, Bank of Montreal, the Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank, along with Bank of

America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank AG and HSBC Holdings PLC.
Bank of America Corp., National Bank, RBC, CIBC, HSBC and Bank of Montreal declined to comment. The other banks didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit.
The CDOR is a benchmark rate that aims to reflect the cost of borrowing funds in Canada and is used to calculate interest on several financial instruments, including interest-rate swaps, forward contracts and other derivatives. It is calculated each business day by Thomson Reuters based on submissions from banks of rates at which they would be willing to lend.
The accusations in the lawsuit are similar to those associated with the London interbank offered rate, the scandal- plagued benchmark that is used to set the price of trillions of dollars of loans and derivatives across the world.
The integrity of Libor was called into question following a rate-rigging scandal where traders at numerous banks were able to nudge it up or down by submitting false data. Banks including Barclays PLC, J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC were fined billions of dollars and several traders were sent to prison.
The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates Libor, said in July that the benchmark would be phased out and that work would begin to plan for a transition to alternate benchmarks.
In the lawsuit related to CDOR, the Colorado pension fund noted that BofA, Deutsche Bank and HSBC ""have collectively paid approximately $4.4 billion in fines to multiple government regulators for manipulating at least 11 benchmarks..."" The suit alleges that their attempts to suppress CDOR are ""part of a broader pattern of price fixing and collusion intended to benefit defendants' trading businesses at the expense of investors.""
The suit claims that the banks conspired to keep CDOR rates low by intentionally quoting lower rates because they were emphasizing derivatives businesses that required them to pay rates based on CDOR. The lower rate saved the banks money and boosted profits on interest- rate swaps and other CDOR-based obligations. The Fire &Police Pension fund said it had conducted more than $1.2 billion in CDOR-based business.

HSBC,"Hong Kong's Hang Seng Closes at Record High; Benchmark rose 1.8% to 31904.75, to top the previous high set on Oct. 30, 2007"," Jan 16, 2018",1,"The Hang Seng Index set a record closing high Tuesday, capping a surge that put Hong Kong stocks among the world's best performers in 2017.
The benchmark rose 1.8% to 31904.75, to top the previous high set on Oct. 30, 2007, just a few weeks after the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 peaked ahead of the global financial crisis.
The Hang Seng, which includes HSBC Holdings PLC and Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., was the latest global benchmark to top a previous record in the past year.
After skidding into the end of 2016 due to worries about a U.S. trade war with China, Hong Kong stocks in 2017 rose in part due to improved earnings from Tencent and insurer AIA Group Ltd. Equities also benefited from an influx of mainland Chinese money that came from the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect.
But lingering worries about China's economy kept most foreign investors out of Hong Kong stocks last year, said Joshua Crabb, head of Asian equities at Old Mutual Global Investors. The Hang Seng rose 36% in 2017.
""It was only a year and a half ago that people thought China was going to explode,"" he added. Following a banner 2017, some fund managers and analysts say headwinds are approaching.
""We may see some kind of pullback, maybe after Chinese New Year,"" said Arthur Kwong, head of Asia-Pacific equities at BNP Paribas Investment Partners.
Mr. Crabb said fears about the Chinese banks kept many global fund managers away from that sector, which accounts for nearly 20% of the Hang Seng's composition. But easing concerns about the health of corporate China may bring a rally in the year ahead, he added.
The sector has started 2018 strongly, with China Construction Bank Corp. climbing 12.5% this month to approach its highest point since 2010.
Mr. Kwong of BNP Paribas isn't alone in expressing near-term caution. Citi expects the Hang Seng will fall to 29500 by the end of this year, about 7.5% lower than where it is now, as most anticipated earnings improvement has been priced in.
Meanwhile, Hong Kong stocks look ""somewhat on the pricey side,"" said Johan Jooste, chief investment officer at Bank of Singapore, in a news conference last week.
The Hang Seng trades with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 13.4, according to data from FactSet. That is far lower than the 21.9 multiple it reached at its October 2007 peak, and relatively low compared with the S&P 500's 18.6.
However, the Hang Seng figure is depressed by single-digit multiples for certain stocks, especially Chinese banks. China Construction, the fourth-largest component in the Hang Seng, trades just 6 times projected earnings for the next year, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

HSBC,"WSJ Survey: Bank of Canada to Raise Rates Wednesday; Stellar jobs data, stronger inflation to override risks posed by potential U.S. withdrawal from Nafta"," Jan 16, 2018",0,"OTTAWA--Bank of Canada watchers are in agreement: The central bank will raise its benchmark interest rate Wednesday because the employment data have been too strong to overlook.
The Bank of Canada's expected move comes even though the uncertain fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement hovers over the economy. To date, trepidation over the possible dissolution of Nafta has yet to show up in the economic indicators, or in the central bank's own survey of firms .
Economists surveyed from 10 of the 11 primary dealers of Canadian government securities told The Wall Street Journal they anticipated the Bank of Canada to lift its benchmark rate by a quarter-percentage point, to 1.25% from 1%, making it the first Group of Seven central bank to raise interest rates in 2018. The last time the Bank of Canada policy rate was near this high was in early 2009, when it sat at 1.5% before then-governor Mark Carney cut it by a half-percentage point in response to the financial crisis and global recession.
The 11th primary dealer, HSBC Canada, didn't participate in the survey.
The economists surveyed said employment growth has been exceptional, with the jobless rate falling to a four- decade low of 5.7% and 2017 marking the best year for job creation since 2002. Nearly 200,000 net new jobs were created in the final quarter of 2017, or the most robust rate of quarterly growth since the start of the decade.
Analysts say the recent string of positive employment gains and strength in wage increases have worked to undermine a view from the Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz that slack, or unused capacity, remains in the labor market .
""The bank will find it hard to look through the strength in the data--from blockbuster job gains, new lows in labor slack, and improvement in core inflation,"" said Brittany Baumann, strategist at TD Securities.
Besides job growth, inflation has also perked up , with the annual rate crossing the 2% threshold in November for only the second time in three years. Economic output has slowed markedly after a stellar run, but is still expanding at a 3.4% year-over-year pace as of October.
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1026 of 1177
The central bank raised rates in July and September last year on strong growth. The Bank of Canada then paused in October and said it would be cautious, arguing it wanted to gauge how indebted households responded to higher borrowing costs and get a better grasp on Nafta. Mr. Poloz said it would be guided by incoming data when making decisions.
Nafta talks have turned contentious, with rhetoric escalating between the U.S. and Canada. The next round of negotiations will unfold next week in Montreal, and they are largely being viewed as a make-or-break session. A published report last week indicating President Donald Trump would imminently withdraw from Nafta led to a downturn in the Canadian and Mexican currencies last week, and a decline in shares of auto firms.
The worry over the end of Nafta wasn't evident in the Bank of Canada's most-recent quarterly survey of businesses. An indicator measuring capital-spending plans--a proxy of trade uncertainty--rose to close to a post- financial-crisis high, with nearly half of the companies surveyed expecting to fork out more money on machinery and equipment over the next 12 months. Hiring intentions also rose, and firms said labor shortages are ""more intense"" than a year ago in sectors such as technology, tourism and construction.
""We are cognizant of the risks to Nafta,"" said Derek Holt, economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, ""but [also] accept the argument that this risk could overhang the Canadian economy for months, quarters or years. There is a limit to how long monetary policy can be put on hold as the economy faces accelerating wage and price pressures amid capacity constraints.""
Bank of Canada's No. 2 official, Carolyn Wilkins, said in a speech last year that uncertainty about the Trump administration's trade policy would be an ""important uncertainty"" in the outlook. ""But,"" she added, ""life goes on and decisions must be made in the meantime.""

HSBC,"HSBC to Pay $101.5 Million to Resolve Federal Fraud Charges; Bank admits to misusing confidential client information for its own profit, a practice known as front-running"," Jan 19, 2018",0,"
HSBC Holdings PLC has agreed to pay $101.5 million to resolve federal fraud charges stemming from the bank's misuse of confidential client information for its own profit, a practice commonly known as front-running.
In documents filed Thursday in Brooklyn federal court, HSBC admitted to using confidential information in two instances for its own profit.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1028 of 1177
In one March 2010 transaction, it converted approximately £5.3 billion ($7.4 billion) to U.S. dollars for a client-- identified in court documents only as a financial-services company--that resulted in a $38.4 million profit for HSBC. In a second transaction in December 2011 for Cairn Energy PLC, an Edinburgh-based oil-and-gas company, HSBC converted about $3.5 billion to British pounds that resulted in a roughly $8 million profit for the bank.
Front-running typically involves a trader jumping ahead of a client's order, buying or selling for their own account to profit when the larger transaction moves a price.
A related federal probe into foreign exchange-rate manipulation led to the conviction of a former high-ranking HSBC executive and charges against a second one.
As part of the proposed resolution, the British bank entered into a three-year deferred-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department and agreed to pay a $63.1 million criminal penalty, continue to cooperate in investigations and prosecutions, strengthen its compliance program and pay back $38.4 million in gains. The bank had previously settled for about $8 million with Cairn Energy.
The agreement must be approved by a judge.
Such agreements, a common tool in the U.S. in corporate prosecutions, give the alleged wrongdoer a chance to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for a less-punitive outcome--typically a fine, admission of wrongdoing and taking measures to improve compliance. Under such agreements, the company is charged but criminal proceedings are suspended as long as conditions of the agreement are met.
HSBC said in a statement it has strengthened its controls and would continue to make more changes. ""HSBC is committed to ensuring fair outcomes for our customers and protecting the orderly and transparent operation of the markets,"" spokesman Rob Sherman said in an email.

HSBC,UBS Catching Up to American Rivals With Buyback; Investors may be upset at expected dividends playing second fiddle to buybacks. They shouldn't," Jan 22, 2018",1,"Some European investment banks are finally catching up with U.S. peers.
UBS will start a share buybacks worth 2 billion Swiss francs ($2 billion) over the next three years, becoming only the second major European banking group after HSBC to hand a big chunk of cash to shareholders this way since the crisis.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1030 of 1177
Shares in the Swiss bank, which was reporting its 2017 results , still lost value Monday despite the buyback plan because UBS's plans for ordinary dividend growth of mid-to-high single-digit percentages each year, whereas analysts had expected 14% to 15% annual growth, according to FactSet.
Investors may be upset at expected dividends playing second fiddle to buybacks. They shouldn't: The overall payout should now be larger than expected. The buyback plan alone, before further dividend growth, provides a greater total payout than the previous consensus forecasts for dividend growth would have paid.
UBS had more of a near-death experience than some European rivals during the crisis, but as a consequence was forced into a major restructuring straightaway, while rivals like Credit Suisse or Deutsche Bank attempted to get by with more limited business changes. As a result, UBS returned to health much more rapidly while those rivals are still dealing with questions about the size and scope of their businesses.
The bank said clarity on the Basel global banking rules , which were completed at the end of last year, gave it a better view of how much capital it would now need to build over coming years. At the same time, the 2.9 billion Swiss francs of losses related to U.S. tax changes didn't cut into its capital or dividend paying capacity because they mainly affect intangible, noncash assets on the balance sheet.
Like U.S. banks, who reported in the past two weeks, UBS saw weak activity in fixed-income trading, but stronger activity in equities. It also saw strong inflows into its wealth management businesses , although margins there were slightly weaker than expected.
Investors should be cheered by these results overall. Not only are they getting more money back than expected, but also the buyback plan leaves plenty leftover to address extra regulatory capital demands and growth in UBS's business. UBS looks to be keeping its nose ahead of its rivals.

HSBC,Gold Surges With Dollar Sliding After Mnuchin Comments; Copper also bounced back from Tuesday's fall," Jan 24, 2018",1,"Gold prices rose to their highest level since August 2016 Wednesday with the dollar hitting fresh multiyear lows after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said a weaker dollar was good for trade .
Front-month gold for January delivery climbed 1.5% to $1,355.90 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices have climbed in eight of the last 10 sessions with the dollar sliding, as a weaker U.S. currency makes dollar-denominated commodities cheaper for overseas buyers.
On Wednesday, the WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of 16 others, slid 0.8% coming off its lowest close in more than two years.
""The recent weakness in the dollar has been key to this going higher,"" said James Steel, chief precious metals analyst at HSBC.
Some analysts have said concerns about trade frictions resulting from the Trump administration's ""America First"" trade policy have also supported gold, a haven asset that some investors favor when they think markets might turn rocky. Earlier this week, the U.S. slapped steep tariffs on washing machines and solar panels, aimed largely at Chinese and other Asian manufacturers. On Wednesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said ""there is potential""

for retaliation from those countries.
""I do think there's some portfolio diversification buying and some safe haven buying going on in gold,"" Mr. Steel said.
Investors will be closely watching Mr. Trump's remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, scheduled for Friday. They will also be tracking economic data and central-bank signals moving forward because gold struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets like Treasurys as borrowing costs rise.
Among base metals, front-month copper for January delivery pared Tuesday's losses, rising 3.9% to $3.2085 a pound in its best session since September 2015. The industrial metal has fallen slightly from nearly four-year highs hit late last month and tumbled Tuesday on concerns about increased Chinese production and higher London Metal Exchange inventories.
Still, some investors see a favorable demand outlook and supply disruptions boosting prices moving forward.

HSBC,Gold Rally Picks Up Steam as Dollar Falters; International trade concerns have sent the dollar sliding and gold prices to recent highs," Jan 27, 2018",1,"The dollar's slide is pushing investors back into gold, sending prices of the precious metal to their highest level since August 2016 in the past week.
Front-month gold has risen 9.1% from its December lows to $1,351.60 a troy ounce, with investors betting that the dollar will fall as global growth picks up and major central banks around the world shift away from their ultra-easy monetary policies. A weaker dollar makes gold and other dollar-denominated commodities cheaper for overseas buyers.
The precious metal got a lift after the dollar fell sharply Wednesday on U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's comments at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, saying that a weaker dollar is good for trade .

three years.
Gold prices fell slightly off their 17-month highs later in the week after President Donald Trump appeared to contradict the Treasury Secretary, saying the U.S. currency would get ""stronger.""
Still, concerns about friction resulting from the Trump administration's ""America First"" trade policy have weighed on the dollar and supported gold, an asset that some investors favor when they think markets might turn rocky. Earlier this week, the U.S. slapped steep tariffs on washing machines and solar panels, aimed largely at Chinese and other Asian manufacturers.
""The focus right now is on the weaker dollar story, and the fear is there will be a bad [North American Free Trade Agreement] story or a bad trade story in general,"" said John Velis, vice president of global macro strategy at State Street Global Markets. If there is retaliation from China or a breakdown in Nafta negotiations, ""at some point equities are going to look at this fundamentally and say this is not good,"" he added.
Mr. Velis said his firm doesn't have a formal view on gold but said the dollar's weakness means gold is looking better.
Other possible geopolitical tensions helped drive gold last year to its best year since 2010, including the heightened rhetoric between the U.S. and North Korea and protests in Iran.
More than $8 billion flowed into gold-backed exchange-traded funds in 2017, according to data compiled by the World Gold Council. When coupled with the 14% rise in gold prices, that influx brought the total assets managed by those ETFs to their highest level since September 2016.
Meantime, hedge funds and other speculative investors increased net bets on higher gold prices in five straight weeks through the week ended Jan. 16, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Net bullish bets are near their 2017 highs from September.
Investors seeking protection against an unexpected pickup in consumer prices have also recently favored gold, which is commonly used as an inflation hedge.
A measure of the bond market's expectation for inflation has climbed. The 10-year inflation break-even rate, which reflects the yield premium on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note over the comparable Treasury inflation- protected security, recently hit its highest level in more than three years, according to Thomson Reuters data.
However, a pickup in inflation could actually threaten the recent gold rally, depending on how it affects central- bank policy and the dollar.
Gold typically struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets like Treasurys as borrowing costs rise, so some analysts question whether the precious metal could hang on to its gains if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates more than investors currently anticipate. The central bank is currently projecting three increases this year, but roughly 40% of traders tracked by CME Group expect fewer than that in 2018, meaning a more aggressive Fed could surprise some money managers.
""We think gold will increasingly run into headwinds from higher rates,"" said James Steel, chief precious metals analyst at HSBC, noting that the precious metal has tended to decline ahead of anticipated interest-rate increases.

A rebound in the dollar or a bearish signal from central banks could end the rally early for gold bugs. For now, however, some are eyeing a $1,400 gold price--a level not seen since 2013.
""It's all systems go,"" said Ira Epstein, a strategist at Linn &Associates, who recently recommended to clients buying gold and taking short positions in the dollar. He said he recommended closing out those short dollar positions Wednesday ahead of the European Central Bank's policy statement Thursday and a speech from Mr. Trump in Davos on Friday.

HSBC,"Aramco IPO Stalled by Indecision Over Where to List; Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil producer continues to weigh risks of listing in New York, London, Hong Kong or locally"," Jan 28, 2018",1,"Two years after Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced his intention to turn Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil producer into the world's largest public company, the kingdom and its advisers remain stuck on the crucial question of where to list the shares.
External advisers and officials at the company, known as Aramco, have privately warned that Prince Mohammed's preferred venue , the New York Stock Exchange, could expose the kingdom to lawsuits from shareholders and 9/11 victims, people familiar with the matter said. The officials include Aramco's powerful chairman, Khalid al-Falih, who is also the country's energy minister.
The company and the kingdom are debating listing Aramco solely on the Saudi stock market, known as Tadawul, but advisers are concerned the exchange won't be able to accommodate the surge in trading that such an enormous company would bring.
Estimates of the value of Aramco range from $1.3 trillion to $2 trillion; the market capitalization of all stocks on
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1042 of 1177
Tadawul is just $451 billion. Saudi Arabia's stock exchange has only been open to international investors since 2015. And while most global exchanges have multiple custodians to facilitate and keep track of trading in stocks, the Tadawul has just one: HSBC Holdings PLC.
A Tadawul-only listing would likely be accompanied by an investment from a sovereign-wealth fund in a country like China, Russia, Singapore or the United Arab Emirates, some of the people said.
Partly as a result of the differences of opinion, progress on the IPO has stalled, frustrating many of the hundreds of bankers, lawyers and consultants who have been working around the clock for more than a year to prepare the listing, people familiar with the process said.
The prospects for an international listing in 2018 look remote, some of the people said. Others say that if the crown prince makes a decision on a venue soon, there could still be one this year.
""We hope that 2018 will be the right time, but ultimately we have to make sure the market is ready,"" Mr. Falih said in Davos, Switzerland, last week, when asked by reporters about a possible delay. ""We will calibrate that as we get closer.""
The IPO of Saudi Arabian Oil Co., as it is officially known, is the centerpiece of Prince Mohammed's grand and risky plan to modernize the kingdom's economy and wean it off oil. The challenges of simply choosing a venue, however, illustrate the broader geopolitical, legal and bureaucratic difficulties of the effort.
Last year Prince Mohammed met with the chief executives of firms including JPMorgan Chase &Co., Evercore Partners Inc., Moelis &Co., and Morgan Stanley to discuss the listing, people familiar with the discussions said. More recently, he has mostly been discussing the IPO with just Mr. Falih and senior ministers who, along with many senior officials at the company, prefers a listing in London , the people said. They see the British capital as having fewer legal risks. The Saudi cabinet remains divided on where to list, the people said.
Prince Mohammed has been spending much of his time recently on the widening corruption probe in which hundreds of senior government officials, prominent businessmen and members of the ruling family have been detained, as well as on conflicts with some Middle Eastern neighbors including Iran, Qatar and Yemen, people familiar with the situation said.
Early in the planning process, Prince Mohammed had told advisers that he preferred the NYSE because it would gain the company access to the largest pool of investors, as well as prestige, people familiar with the discussions said. More recently, these people said he has talked about the importance of an NYSE listing to bolster U.S.-Saudi diplomatic and economic ties and his already close relationship with President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner.
In a November 2017 tweet, the president said: ""Would very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange. Important to the United States!""
A White House spokesman declined to comment.
Prince Mohammed has told advisers that he thinks Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner could get the NYSE to relax some of its regulations or help limit the potential for lawsuits, people familiar with the process said. Advisers have told Prince Mohammed that Mr. Trump has no direct control over exchange regulations or any lawsuits related to the

Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks , the people said.
Members of Aramco's internal IPO team recently met with Chief Executive Amin Nasser to discuss how they could still list in New York, one person familiar with the meeting said. One possibility they discussed was to create and then list just a subsidiary with some of Aramco's upstream and downstream assets. They said such a move could potentially shield the broader company from lawsuits. Still, this was seen as a ""last-resort option,"" the person said.
Aramco in recent weeks also contacted several new banks and invited them to Saudi Arabia to make pitches for potential roles on the IPO team, people familiar with the process said. It told them to draft presentations on a venue-agnostic basis.
Aramco's IPO team has most of the paperwork ready for a listing in New York, London, Hong Kong or locally, people familiar with the matter said. Bankers on the deal say they have never seen another company work in this manner, as normally a venue decision is made first, because of the time it takes to draft even a single, less- complicated prospectus.
The Aramco IPO team has recently been discussing listing by October of this year solely on Tadawul, these people said, but some advisers remain skeptical. They have already watched the company blow through many self- imposed deadlines.
Several investment bankers said they are struggling to keep staff on the project. Many have become nervous that the IPO will never happen or will raise much less than expected. They worry they will miss out on career opportunities and bonus payments if their work generates minimal revenue.

HSBC,Justice Department Charges Eight Traders With Deceptive Futures Market Trading; The Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced related civil charges against three banks and six individuals," Jan 29, 2018",0,"
WASHINGTON--Federal prosecutors on Monday announced charges against eight traders for deceptive trading practices in the futures markets, with all but one person charged with illegal spoofing.
The traders worked for UBS Group AG and Deutsche Bank AG, among other firms. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission later announced related civil charges against three banks and six individuals.
""Conduct like this poses significant risk of eroding confidence in U.S. markets and creates an uneven playing field for legitimate traders and investors,"" acting assistant attorney general John P. Cronan said in a statement.
Before Monday's cases, only three individuals had ever been charged with spoofing, which involves a trader entering large orders with the intention of tricking others into thinking there had been a fundamental change in supply and demand in a market. Congress outlawed the practice in 2010 as part of the Dodd-Frank Act . In August, a federal appeals court upheld the conviction of the first U.S. trader to face prison time for manipulating futures prices using spoofing tactics.
In addition to the criminal charges, the CFTC announced civil settlements with Deutsche Bank, UBS, and HSBC Securities Inc. related to commodities fraud and spoofing. Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $30 million after the CFTC charged it with engaging in a scheme to manipulate the prices of precious metal futures. UBS reached a $15 million settlement for similar charges, and HSBC agreed to pay $1.6 million, also for spoofing in precious metals markets. The fines for UBS and HSBC were lower due to their cooperation with the CFTC, including UBS self- reporting much of the illegal activity, the agency said.
""These cases should send a strong signal that we at the CFTC are committed to identifying individuals responsible for unlawful activity and holding them accountable,"" said CFTC Enforcement Director James McDonald.
Monday's cases are the most significant action taken against banks for spoofing since the CFTC fined Citigroup Inc. $25 million last January for illegal activity in Treasury futures markets . Citigroup neither admitted to nor denied the allegations.
In one of the cases, the CFTC fined Andre Flotron, a former UBS precious metals trader in Stamford, Conn., and Zurich, with concocting a spoofing scheme for personal and corporate profit. UBS had provided its futures traders, including Mr. Flotron, with automated trading software that allowed them to ""place, modify, and cancel multiple orders nearly simultaneously,"" according to a criminal indictment filed in September.
Mr. Flotron's lawyer, Marc Mukasey, said the new case ""is an especially enormous waste of taxpayers' money because the CFTC knows darn well that there is a pending criminal matter, that Mr. Flotron has long been retired from the business, and that he lives in Switzerland. Their case is a paper tiger.""

Rob Sherman, a spokesman for HSBC, said the bank was ""pleased to have resolved this issue.""
A UBS spokesman noted that the bank ""cooperated fully in the investigation, and has long since remediated the conduct,"" while a spokesperson for Deutsche Bank said the bank provided ""substantial and proactive cooperation with the government's investigation and has enhanced controls and surveillance to help ensure that the underlying conduct does not occur in the future.""
The charges against the traders primarily reference activity before 2015, when both firms and regulators lacked sufficient controls to monitor for spoofing activity, as trading migrated from open pits to electronic platforms.
""The conduct at issue here started in 2008,"" said Michael Friedman, general counsel of Trillium Management LLC, a New York-based electronic-trading firm, which isn't involved in the cases announced Monday. ""When this conduct was in its heyday, which is now seven to eight years ago, people weren't looking to detect it like they are now.""
The cases mark the first major enforcement actions of 2018 for the CFTC and Mr. McDonald, who took over as enforcement director in April 2017. The relatively large fines follow a year that saw a steep drop in total financial penalties, although it can be hard to compare years that involve a change in agency leadership.

HSBC,"Sale of Slotomania Maker Playtika Hits Regulatory Snag in China; After more than a year in review, Giant Interactive unit's deal for Israeli-based firm may be foiled by Chinese regulators"," Jan 30, 2018",1,"BEIJING--The sale of a company known for its popular casino-style games for smartphones has hit a regulatory hurdle that could potentially thwart the deal, say people familiar with the matter, and make it the latest high-profile deal to be affected by the country's clampdown on foreign acquisitions.
The company, Playtika, was sold by a unit of casino operator Caesars Entertainment Corp. in 2016 for $4.4 billion in cash to a Chinese consortium that included an offshore affiliate of Giant Interactive Group and a private-equity firm co-founded by Alibaba's Jack Ma. Giant said its publicly listed unit, Shanghai Giant Network Technology Co., would buy Playtika from the consortium for 30.5 billion yuan ($4.8 billion) in mostly stock pending regulatory approval.
The people familiar with the matter say the China Securities Regulatory Commission is reluctant to approve the sale to Shanghai Giant over concerns that Playtika's games promote gambling, which is illegal in China except for Macau. The CSRC didn't respond to a request for comment.
The people cautioned the acquisition hasn't been formally rejected and could still be approved.
Giant, one of China's largest developers of online games, said in a statement that Playtika remains under ""normal review"" and that regulators haven't raised specific objections to gambling themes. The company said Playtika's games don't meet the legal definition of gambling and aren't available in China.
Even so, Giant representatives met with regulators last year to explain how no money is won or lost in play, one of the people said.

Winning money isn't possible in Playtika's games, which can be played for free. Its popular slot-machine game, Slotomania, began as a Facebook game before migrating to online app stores run by Apple and Google. The game earns revenue from the small fraction of players who buy virtual coins, which they can bet and trade in for virtual prizes.
""Over the past six to nine months, Chinese regulators have said pretty clearly that gambling-specific-type companies are out of bounds,"" said Christopher Balding, a professor at the HSBC Business School in Shenzhen. ""In 2016, this deal might have been waived through, but in early 2018, it wouldn't surprise me if it didn't.""
China's securities regulator received the deal application on Nov. 10, 2016, making it the second-longest among 75 transactions currently in active review. The median time in active review was 75 days as of Jan. 26.
Industry analysts and people familiar with the deal say the long delay is a red flag, and a common tactic used by Chinese regulators to kill deals without taking formal action.
Playtika was founded in 2010 in Israel and acquired for $100 million the following year by Caesars. Slotomania accounted for one-fifth of global spending on social-casino games in November, the most recent data available, according to SuperData Research Inc.
Slotomania is a top-grossing app on mobile platforms run by Google and Apple, according to analytics firm App Annie. This month, it briefly became the third-highest grossing app in the Google Play U.S. store and the ninth- highest in Apple's U.S. App Store, according to App Annie.
Chinese authorities have recently stepped up scrutiny of outbound investments, in particular media and entertainment assets, which tend to be volatile and difficult to price. Amid the clampdown, Dalian Wanda Group abandoned its $1 billion takeover of Golden Globes producer Dick Clark Productions in March 2017. Outbound investments announced by Chinese companies fell by a third last year to $217 billion in deals, according to Dealogic.

HSBC,"Eurozone Inflation Continues to Lag, Despite Robust Economic Growth; At 1.3%, eurozone inflation rate remains well short of the ECB's target"," Jan 31, 2018",1,"The eurozone's economy is having its best spell in a decade, with unemployment at a nine-year low, but there are still few signs of the sustained pickup in inflation long sought by the European Central Bank.
Figures released Tuesday showed eurozone gross domestic product grew by 2.5% in 2017 , its fastest expansion since 2007 and well above ECB's forecast when the year started, which was for 1.7%.
The central bank has already responded to speedier growth by halving its monthly bond purchases under a stimulus program known as quantitative easing to [euro]30 billion. Traders and investors expect to see a further withdrawal of stimulus later this year, which helps explain why the euro has strengthened against the U.S. dollar over recent months.
But figures released Wednesday once again highlighted a missing ingredient in the eurozone's expansion: an acceleration in the rate at which consumer prices are rising. The European Union's statistics agency said prices were 1.3% higher in January than a year earlier, the lowest rate of annual inflation since July 2017 and well short of the ECB's target, which is just below 2%.
Some of that decline had been expected by the ECB, since energy prices jumped at the turn into 2017, and those sharp rises haven't been repeated this year. But not all of the weakness in inflation is down to energy prices. According to Eurostat, services prices rose at an annual rate of 1.2%, unchanged for four straight months. Overall, the core rate of inflation--which excludes volatile items such as energy and food--edged up to 1.0% from 0.9%.
The ECB continues to expect that inflation will eventually rise, driven in large part by a rise in wages as unemployment falls and workers become more scarce. Policy makers believe that businesses will increase their prices to cover increased wage bills, while consumers with higher incomes will be more willing and able to pay those prices.
From the ECB's perspective, the disappointing inflation figures were therefore partially ameliorated by a separate release from Eurostat on Wednesday that showed the number of people without work fell by 134,000 in December, bringing the total for 2017 to over 1.5 million.
But it is uncertain how quickly or how far wages will rise, given changes in the priorities of workers since the crisis, and the type of jobs that have been created.
""In some countries, even though the labor market is tight, the unions are not negotiating for higher wages immediately but rather for job security,"" said ECB President Mario Draghi last Thursday. ""There is plenty of evidence that even though employment's gone up a lot, a lot--much of it is of a temporary, part-time quality.""
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1058 of 1177
An additional worry for the ECB is that the timing of the decline in inflation may in itself limit the pace of future wage rises. The early months of the year are a busy period for setting pay deals, and workers' demands are heavily influenced by the current rate of inflation.
""If inflation stays low for too long, it might feed into the many wage negotiations taking place at the beginning of the year, possibly creating a negative spiral,"" said Fabio Balboni, an economist at HSBC.
The mixed signals from the eurozone economy are dividing opinion among policy makers. Some, such as executive board member Benoi?t Coeure?, have called for a swift reduction of stimulus , pointing to stronger growth. But others, such as ECB Chief Economist Peter Praet, have counseled ""patience and persistence,"" citing still-weak inflation.
Meanwhile, the euro's recent rise against the U.S. dollar could work against the ECB by lowering prices of imported goods, including energy.

HSBC,Bank of America Hires Law Firm to Help Probe $292 Million Loss; Davis Polk &amp;amp; Wardwell brought in to look into charge stemming from Steinhoff loan," Feb 7, 2018",0,"Bank of America Corp. has brought in an outside law firm to help examine a soured lending arrangement that led to a $292 million charge in last year's fourth quarter, according to people familiar with the matter.
The losses sprang from financing involving troubled South African firm Steinhoff International Holdings NV, the people said. Bank of America is trying to figure out if the losses, which surfaced at many big global banks , could somehow have been avoided, the people said.
The inquiry is being conducted by law firm Davis Polk &Wardwell LLP and began late last year, the people said. The law firm recently has interviewed Bank of America staff, some of the people added.
Bank of America's board is being kept abreast of the inquiry, which is ongoing, some of the people said.
""One of the reasons we have record-low credit losses is because we take the time to analyze what happened when things don't go as planned and learn from it. It's the responsible thing for a financial institution to do,"" a bank spokesman said.
Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan alluded to the inquiry on the bank's earnings call in January. ""It is always a wake-up call that some things don't turn out well, and we got to go back and what are lessons learned and what did we do right or wrong on that and how we avoid that in the future,"" Mr. Moynihan said of the loss. ""We weren't happy with it, from the top of the house through to the actual people who were involved in it.""
Bank of America was one of a number of global lenders that held pieces of a [euro]1.6 billion ($2.0 billion) loan to Christo Wiese, then chairman of the South African retailer. Mr. Wiese's shares in the company served as collateral for the financing.
Those shares collapsed in value last fall after the retailer, which owns Mattress Firm and the Sleepy's brand, disclosed accounting irregularities.
The speed of the resulting share-price decline--the stock was worth 120% of the loan on Dec. 5 and less than 24% two days later--left banks few good options . In addition to Bank of America, Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase &Co. and Goldman Sachs Group disclosed losses to what was typically described as a single-name client in the fourth quarter.
This client, people familiar with the matter said, was Steinhoff. The four banks booked a combined hit to fourth- quarter earnings of more than $1 billion.
Bank of America's $292 million loss was the second-largest charge for the quarter and was spread across its global banking and markets divisions.
That drove the bulk of loan-loss provisions in both units in the fourth quarter , a sign of both how large the
  PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1063 of 1177
Steinhoff loss was--and how healthy the rest of the units' portfolios were by contrast. Citigroup had the highest charge, described as up to $370 million.
The losses hit banks so quickly and broadly that many analysts have brushed off the charges as a one-time occurrence that isn't indicative of broader underwriting problems. Still, Bank of America is looking to see how the exposure to Steinhoff came to be and how the bank can avoid similar problems in the future, the people familiar with the matter said.
Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and Nomura put together the original loan to Mr. Wiese. Those banks sold off large chunks of their exposure to several other banks, including Bank of America.
The loan was made to a vehicle controlled by Mr. Wiese in September 2016 to help him fund a Steinhoff capital- raising needed to pay for one of its many acquisitions. Mr. Wiese's vehicles pledged 628 million shares--at that point worth [euro]3.175 billion--as collateral against the loan.
In essence, Mr. Wiese borrowed against his Steinhoff shares to buy more Steinhoff shares. Such stock-based lending had been booming across the banking industry due to what was until recent days a long, low-volatility stock rally and the loans' light capital requirements.
Bank of America, which experienced major losses and fines in connection with the financial crisis, has become much more conservative in recent years across its businesses.

HSBC,"Standout Risk-Parity Fund Faces Loss as Volatility Surges; Quantedge's fund had risen 7% in January but is now 'slightly negative' for the year, says chief executive"," Feb 8, 2018",0,"
One of Asia's star hedge funds has fallen victim to the sharp rise in volatility that has swept through global markets in recent days.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1065 of 1177
Singapore-based Quantedge Capital Pte. Ltd. said the turbulence had more than erased the 7% gain its fund had achieved in January.
It is an abrupt turnaround for Quantedge, which has been one of the world's standout hedge funds in recent years . The fund gained 38.4% during 2017, making it the seventh-best performer in a weekly survey of 469 global hedge funds compiled by HSBC.
Quantedge describes itself as a volatility-targeting fund, meaning it attempts to maintain a set amount of risk in its portfolio while trading dozens of instruments including equities, bonds, commodities and currencies. The firm has frequently generated double-digit profits in the past decade, as its assets under management grew to $1.7 billion at the end of December.
""The effect on the equities market hasn't been great for us,"" said Suhaimi Zainul-Abidin, Quantedge's chief executive, in a phone interview. ""A spike in volatility means that we would have to cut positions to maintain constant volatility. That's something we can't avoid.""
Mr. Suhaimi said the fund was now ""slightly negative"" for the year.
Its strategy contrasts with that of traditional fund managers, which typically allocate a percentage of the money they control to different asset classes based on their view of their likely relative performance. Quantedge's practice of targeting a constant level of volatility typically requires taking on more leverage when markets are calm and decreasing risk-taking when markets are turbulent.
The Quantedge system is similar to that adopted by a growing number of so-called risk-parity funds around the world. Such funds have made double-digit gains during each of the past two years, according to data from HFR Inc., benefiting from the unusual level of tranquility in world markets. An index of risk-parity funds targeting volatility of 10% returned 13.5% last year, while funds targeting 15% volatility gained more than 20%.
But the market calm of the past few years was jolted by sharp declines in stocks this week, causing a jump in the Cboe Volatility Index , commonly referred to as the VIX. The gauge, which tracks expectations of how much the market will fluctuate, jumped to a three-year high of 50.3 on Tuesday after trading below 15 for most of the past year.
Quantedge trades the VIX and other measures of volatility among dozens of different market instruments it uses in its strategy. Mr. Suhaimi said the fund had used options on the VIX that would pay out if volatility continued to decrease.
Several investors betting on markets remaining calm incurred heavy losses this week. Exchange-traded notes offered by Credit Suisse AG and Nomura Holdings Inc. betting that the VIX would fall had almost tripled in value during the past year. Those products were all but wiped out this week.
Quantedge is raising money from investors for new share classes of its fund, which will charge lower management fees in exchange for them agreeing to lock up capital for longer periods.
The firm has offered two new share classes to investors that will prohibit withdrawals for between three and five years. Its existing share classes allow client money to be withdrawn monthly.

Mr. Suhaimi said the move was in response to robust client demand.
""We've had a healthy response,"" he said. ""We've got a big group of investors who have been with us for a long time. They've been through ups and downs and they appreciate this strategy involves high volatility. It's all part and parcel of the long-term strategy of the fund.""

HSBC,Emerging Markets Hang Tough During Global Selloff; Some of the world's most volatile markets weathered the past week better than investors expected," Feb 8, 2018",1,"Wild price swings this week upended stocks and bonds around the globe, but some of the historically most volatile markets are holding up better-than-expected compared with past global selloffs.
Since U.S. markets reached a high on January 26, the S&P 500 index and the MSCI index that measures developed markets overseas have both tumbled 6.7%. Emerging-market stocks performed better during much of the recent selloff, though these stocks stumbled harder on Wednesday. The MSCI emerging-markets index is now down 7.8% since January 26.
Bonds issued by companies and countries in the developing world started selling off last week, but by Wednesday the spread between emerging-market debt and U.S. Treasurys--or the extra yield investors receive for emerging markets--had narrowed back to levels in late January.

for developing countries that export commodities or are manufacturing hubs. The International Monetary Fund expects emerging economies as a whole to grow 4.9% in 2018, up from 4.7% last year, and more than double the growth rate in advanced economies. The European Union also said the near-term growth outlook for the developing world has improved, citing buoyant export and service-sector momentum in China and among commodity exporters.
Many emerging-market governments have been building up their foreign-currency reserves, which gives them extra financial flexibility. Stabilizing commodity prices and a weakening dollar, which makes it cheaper for these countries to pay back dollar-denominated debt, have also helped.
""The emerging markets environment remains positive and we haven't changed our exposure because of the selloff,"" said Michael Reynal, chief investment officer of Sophus Capital, part of the $55 billion asset manager Victory Capital.
After years of underperformance compared with the developed world, stocks in emerging markets remain cheap versus those in the U.S. or Europe. Companies in the MSCI emerging-markets stock index are trading around 16 times their last 12 months of earnings, compared with companies in the MSCI US index that are trading at about 22 times their 12-month trailing earnings, according to Joe Gubler, portfolio manager at Causeway Emerging Markets Fund.
With many emerging-markets shares relatively inexpensive, it was the pricier ones that sold off the most during this week's declines, according to a Goldman Sachs Investment Strategy Group analysis of January valuations. Two industries in the MSCI emerging-markets index--biotechnology and internet and software services--were trading at levels that were expensive compared with their historic valuations.
A prolonged slump in U.S. markets may yet take a more serious toll on emerging-market stocks and bonds, analysts say, and the market volatility has already been disruptive in pockets. A bond sale Tuesday by Camposol S.A.--a Peruvian avocado, blueberry and shrimp farming company--was delayed due to market conditions, investors said. A Camposol official didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Two bankers said they had encouraged one government issuer and several companies that had started a bond- sales process to hold off pricing until volatility subsided. Any sales this week, one of the bankers said, would have had to offer between 10 and 15 basis points more in yield than if they were sold before the big market-price swings.
Even without more big spikes in volatility, risks remain for emerging-markets investors. Bonds from these countries has benefited from investors' global search for yield when interest rates in the developed world are near historic lows. But if the Federal Reserve responds to recent wage growth or other nascent signs of inflation by raising rates more aggressively than expected, that could start to slow the hunt for yield. Higher U.S. rates typically drive investors away from emerging markets by making their bonds, stocks and currencies less attractive.
""The Fed continues to be a concern for the space and there are political risks in places like Mexico and Brazil,"" said Richard Segal, emerging-market analyst at Manulife Asset Management, which manages $383 billion.

HSBC,Stock Selloff: From Overdue to Overdone," Feb 12, 2018",0,"Little has changed fundamentally to justify the recent selloffin stocks, say some market analysts.
U.S. STOCKS PLUMMETED 5.2% LAST WEEK, AND EUROPEAN markets held up only slightly better. The Stoxx Europe 600 index gave up 5%, cutting its 12-month gain to about 1%. Strategists pinned the drop in part on the need for a healthy correction after the run-up of the past few months, and on rising bond yields, which ticked up on signs of impending inflation. The higher yields lured money out of equities.
Market bulls aren't throwing in the towel yet. ""We may have moved from being 'overdue' for a pullback to approaching 'overdone,' "" Mark Haefele, the Zurich-based global chief investment officer for UBS Wealth Management, wrote in a note to clients. Recent equity selling has resembled ""generic 'risk off' behavior,"" Steven Andrew, a London-based multi-asset fund manager at M&G Investments, said in an email to Barron's, adding that ""from a fundamental standpoint, little seems to have changed. Our predisposition would be to add equity exposure.""
Don't bank on big changes in European Central Bank policy, other strategists suggested. At its January meeting, the ECB made no changes to interest rates, kept its forward guidance in place, and reiterated that a bond-buying program is intended to run until the end of September, or beyond, if necessary. Meanwhile, the Bank of England said on Thursday that British interest rates might rise sooner than previously expected, as the BOE made no changes to monetary policy. But analysts emphasized that the central bank's moves will depend on how the United

Kingdom's departure from the European Union unfolds.
""One of the reasons given to explain the selloffhas been a shiftin expectations regarding inflation and what this means for central-bank policy,"" HSBC's multi-asset strategy team wrote in a note. But there is ""little reason for the ECB to change the asset-purchase program or its guidance at this stage,"" added the team, led by Pierre Blanchet.
HSBC advises caution. Euro-zone stocks are at risk because they're typically weak performers during broad corrections, and companies have experienced a hit to earnings due to the strengthening euro, Blanchet and his colleagues wrote.
When the going gets tough, the prudent get defensive. Hence, the appeal of consumer-staples stocks. The sector has proved resilient even as the broad market slumps, and several stocks have particular appeal.
Henkel (ticker: HEN3.Germany), Unilever (UL), and Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB.UK) look good to a team of Berenberg analysts who cover companies producing packaged foods, household items, and personal-care products. The team names them as its top picks, and wrote in a recent note that all three offer a ""mixture of attractive relative valuation, organic growth acceleration, margin expansion, and M&A [merger and acquisition potential], while showing agility in their business models.""
Unilever and Henkel trade around 18 times forward-year estimated earnings, below the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) fund's multiple of 20, while Reckitt's forward price/earnings ratio matches that popular U.S. fund's multiple. Each stock scores a Buy rating from Berenberg, which has price targets that imply a rally of more than 20%.
Henkel, whose products include All and Persil Pr°Clean laundry detergents, Dial soap, and Right Guard deodorant, has ""shown that it can turn around challenged businesses (e.g., professional hair care) and scale up where needed (e.g., U.S. laundry and hair care),"" wrote Berenberg's James Targett, Rosie Edwards, and their colleagues.
More than half of the German company's sales come from its adhesives business. That unit ought to repeat last year's 5% organic growth due to an expanding global economy, new end markets, and other factors, the bank reckons.
Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever, whose shares trade in the U.K. (ULVR.UK) and Amsterdam (UNA.Netherlands) as well as New York, is ""taking the biggest steps in the industry to increase the agility of its business model, reduce costs, embrace digital and e-commerce, and future-proof its portfolio,"" Berenberg's team notes.
The parent company for Lipton tea and Dove soap had a ""dampened market reaction"" to its earnings report this month because of a softening in pricing and vague guidance on margins and stock buybacks, but the fourth quarter looked strong overall.
Reckitt looks poised to return to growth after troubles last year due to a massive cyberattack, a South Korean boycott, and other problems that don't appear structural, according to the Berenberg analysts. The parent company for Lysol wipes and Durex condoms has generated headlines this month because of its interest in Pfizer's (PFE) consumer health-care business. The possibility of a deal has spooked some investors, but Morgan Stanley analysts see brands such as Advil that ""would complement RB's portfolio.""

HSBC,HSBC Misses Profit Target as Bad Loan Charges Weigh on Results; Bank hit by the high-profile collapses of two borrowers in the U.K. and South Africa," Feb 20, 2018",0,"
LONDON--HSBC Holdings PLC's full-year profit missed analysts' expectations after the bank was hit by the high- profile collapses of two borrowers in the U.K. and South Africa.
Debt related to South African retailer Steinhoff International Holdings NV and U.K. services and construction company Carillion PLC helped push the bank's bad loan charges to $1.77 billion for the year, more than expected. Steinhoff announced in December it had found accounting irregularities and is restructuring. Carillion went bust in January .
HSBC's shares were down 4% in morning trading in London after the bank said it would put a share buyback program on hold while it raises additional debt in the first half of the year. While marketing the planned $5 billion to $7 billion in additional Tier 1 capital, listing rules prevent it from buying back shares. HSBC bought back $3 billion in shares last year and incoming CEO John Flint said Tuesday there has been ""no change in our attitude"" to consider buying back more shares after the debt sale is completed.
Tuesday's results are the last under Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver, who is retiring from the role after 38 years with the bank. Mr. Gulliver in an interview said his seven years as CEO produced ""satisfactory"" outcomes for shareholders, in a period marked by several damaging scandals for HSBC and broader shifts in banking regulation and profitability.
HSBC said its 2017 net profit surged to $9.68 billion from $1.30 billion a year earlier, in part thanks to higher revenue from Asia. Full-year revenue rose to $51.45 billion from $47.97 billion. Pretax profit of $17.17 billion was less than the $19.55 billion estimated in a poll of 20 analysts conducted by FactSet.

As CEO since 2011, Mr. Gulliver oversaw a dramatic reshaping of 153-year-old HSBC, pulling out of countries and exiting dozens of businesses to improve profits and reduce risks from financial crime.
The bank's reputation hit a low in 2012 when it agreed to pay $1.9 billion to settle allowed drug traffickers and sanctioned nations from moving money through the U.S. financial system. It pledged to overhaul its compliance systems and entered a five-year deferred-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Justice Department. The agreement expired in December without any further action required.
Mr. Gulliver previously said he would assess his success as CEO by the bank's stock price at the time of his departure and the state of HSBC's reputation, among other measures. The shares are up 17% from his start as CEO on Jan. 1, 2011, and 70% since February 2016.
On Tuesday, Mr. Gulliver said the bank has much better controls and ability now to detect and prevent financial crime, helping to safeguard its reputation. The bank has met eight of 10 targets Mr. Gulliver set out in 2015, the two laggards being U.S. profitability and revenues related to the internationalization of the Chinese yuan.
Mr. Gulliver's successor, Mr. Flint, is also a career HSBC banker, having joined in 1989 and most recently served as global head of retail and wealth management.

* Heard on the Street: Where to Look for HSBC's Next Big Move Credit: By Margot Patrick"
HSBC,"Where to Look for HSBC's Next Big Move; U.K. bank is quiet on strategic changes for now, but there are big reasons for investors to think beyond Asia"," Feb 20, 2018",1,"HSBC marked its handover of power with a moment of silence. The U.K.-based lender said nothing about its plans for strategy or share buybacks at its results Tuesday , disappointing investors, who sent the stock down as much as 4.5%.
Departing Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver resisted any temptation to give shareholders a parting gift, while his
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1086 of 1177
replacement, John Flint , wouldn't offer the faintest teaser for the new leadership's strategic program.
Results were slightly weaker than expected, but it was the lack of news on payouts that had analysts worried. HSBC has funded $5.5 billion worth of stock buybacks in the past 18 months or so on top of roughly $10 billion a year in steady dividends for most of Mr. Gulliver's tenure.
The bank said the lack of a buyback was a technicality: It can't buy shares while it is selling new junior debt to meet regulatory targets. However, this pause gives Mr. Flint and new Chairman Mark Tucker a chance to make some kind of splash later this year when the pair will set new goals on payouts and launch a new strategy.
So what might that strategy entail? The core element will be unchanged: That is its focus on winning more retail and business clients in Southern China's Pearl River Delta.
But investors should keep an eye on the U.S., where HSBC has excess capital and an opportunity to buy very low- tax earnings growth because it has a vast stock of potential tax discounts.
Like rivals, HSBC took a $1.3 billion charge on deferred tax assets after the U.S. tax cuts, leaving it with $3.2 billion of tax assets to use up on its current business.
But unlike rivals it has another $12.3 billion of potential deferred tax assets, which go unrecognized right now because it is very unlikely to earn enough in the U.S. to use them.
Mr. Tucker's experience in Asia and in insurance has most people looking in that direction for clues as to its coming growth or acquisition plans. However, with about $3 billion in spare capital in the U.S. and this large pool of tax discounts, don't be surprised if the bank is already fishing in those waters, too.

HSBC,"Airlines Are Booming, So Why Are Investors Worried? Investors worry that expansion plans and rising costs are threatening profit"," Feb 23, 2018",1,"Global airlines are cruising through one of the industry's big booms, but investors are already growing worried they may end up squandering it.
British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group SA reported Friday record net profit, joining a host of global airlines, including United Continental Holdings Inc. and American Airlines Group Inc., enjoying strong earnings amid greater-than-expected passenger growth.
But IAG, which operates BA, Ireland's Aer Lingus and Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling, also said it would increase capacity, a measure of seats sold over distance flown. The expansion, 6.7% this year, was ahead of the company's midterm target and caught investors by surprise.
IAG shares were down almost 5% in midday trading in London, as shareholders worried that the expansion plans could cut into profit.
The drop follows similar shareholder angst in the U.S. United Continental, the No. 3 U.S. airline, spooked investors last month when it announced greater-than-anticipated expansion plans, sending shares down 11% on the day and dragging down other airline stocks. Airline shares slid further when American Airlines and Southwest Airlines Co. last month signaled that costs were rising .
""Airlines have gone out of fashion, with weakening capacity discipline in the U.S. domestic market and the fuel price rallying,"" HSBC said this week.
The turbulence is hitting airlines after a period in which a combination of factors have helped lift the industry--one
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1090 of 1177
that is been particularly vulnerable to boom-bust cycles.
In recent quarters, carriers in the U.S. and Europe, the two largest contributors to collective industry profit last year, have delivered bumper earnings through a combination of low fuel prices, control of costs, and restrained growth. As passengers started taking to the skies in record numbers, big airlines have been able to raise ticket prices, lifting shares.
The bull market has affected the larger air-transport industry. Boeing Co. and Airbus SE are cranking out jetliners at an unprecedented pace to satisfy airlines clamoring for planes. Banks and private investors have flooded the market for plane financing.
But airline investors have turned skittish more recently, fretting about rising fuel prices, excessive expansion plans, and creeping costs.
IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh insisted passenger unit revenue will grow despite the boost in seats-for-sale and that the company would deliver ""accretive sensible growth."" British Airways, IAG's biggest profit contributor, would only expand around 3% this year, he said.
Operating profit should rise again this year to a record, Mr. Walsh said, underpinned by the improvement in passenger unit revenue and currency-adjusted nonfuel unit costs. To signal its confidence, IAG also announced a [euro]500 million ($615 million) share buyback.
Air France-KLM last week reported record operating earnings, though the net result was dented by pension charges. The airline also disclosed plans to lift capacity. Shares tumbled 6.4% on the day.
Rising fuel costs are a growing concern. IAG expects its fuel expenses this year to rise by [euro]500 million to around [euro]5.1 billion, compared with 2017. ""We are worried about fuel prices,"" IAG Chief Financial Officer Enrique Dupuy said Friday. Air France-KLM said its fuel bill would also be higher in 2018.
Shares in Southwest Airlines, the No. 1 U.S. budget carrier, are down 12.4% this year. Air France-KLM shares have tumbled more than 25%, and Deutsche Lufthansa AG, which reports 2017 earnings next month, is down more than 10%.

HSBC,"CFTC Steps Up Enforcement Against Fraud, Market Manipulation; Regulator to file 'more than 10' cases in coming weeks, bringing annual tally to a record"," Feb 27, 2018",0,"WASHINGTON--U.S. derivatives regulators are expected to file ""more than 10"" fraud and market-manipulation cases in the next weeks as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman implements his back-to-basics approach, according to a person familiar with the CFTC's enforcement operation.
The stepped-up enforcement comes after the CFTC recorded a big drop in fines and enforcement actions during the fiscal year that spanned the transition from the Obama administration to the Trump administration.
Enforcement has picked up since then. The agency has already filed 11 manipulation-related cases in the current fiscal year, which ends in September, just one shy of its annual record. The person declined to specify how many of the coming cases concern market manipulation as opposed to more conventional retail fraud.
A CFTC spokeswoman declined to comment on pending enforcement actions, but said the agency was ""charging a high number of complex manipulation cases.""
The focus on manipulation and retail fraud fits with Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo's direction for the agency since he took the helm last year. In a speech to the main derivatives industry gathering last year, he promised to ""reset"" the agency's focus on its core missions of market oversight and enforcement, after years of ""overly prescriptive regulation.""
In the fiscal year that ended in September 2017, the CFTC said it brought 49 total enforcement actions, down from
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1095 of 1177
68 the previous year. The agency's fines amounted to a third of what it collected the preceding year: Restitution, disgorgement and penalties for the year ended Sept. 30 totaled $413 million, down from $1.29 billion.
At a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing this month, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) took notice of those numbers and criticized the agency's enforcement record under Mr. Giancarlo. ""It seems like a deliberate pullback in enforcement,"" Mr. Brown said.
Mr. Giancarlo replied that the numbers weren't indicative of his enforcement priorities, since nearly half the fiscal year had fallen under the Obama administration, and hinted that ""you'll see, going forward, an enforcement agenda that reflects more of my priorities.""
The number of cases brought by the agency has also rebounded from its dip last year. In fiscal year 2017, just eight cases were filed through January, while 17 had been filed by January of this year. In the last full fiscal year of the Obama administration, 14 cases were filed through January.
The uptick in cases has in part been a result of another enforcement policy Mr. Giancarlo put in place that grants ""substantial"" benefits to firms that self-report wrongdoing and makes them eligible for ""significantly reduced"" financial penalties.
In January, the agency continued its postcrisis crackdown on manipulative ""spoofing,"" jointly filing cases with the Justice Department that charged eight traders with deceptive futures market trading .
In addition to the criminal charges, the CFTC announced civil settlements with Deutsche Bank AG, UBS Group AG and HSBC Securities Inc. related to commodities fraud and spoofing, which involves a trader entering large orders with the intention of tricking others into thinking there had been a fundamental change in supply and demand in a market. Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $30 million after the CFTC charged it with engaging in a scheme to manipulate the prices of precious-metals futures. UBS reached a $15 million settlement for similar charges, and HSBC agreed to pay $1.6 million, also for spoofing in precious-metals markets.
The fines for UBS and HSBC were lower due to their cooperation with the CFTC, the agency said, adding that UBS self-reported much of the illegal activity.
The CFTC has also filed a number of novel cases in recent months, including three related to virtual-currency fraud . The cases were the first to be brought since the commission allowed the launch of bitcoin futures contracts last month, a move that coincided with a run-up in bitcoin's price amid skyrocketing demand by retail investors.

HSBC,"Eurozone Inflation Rate Falls for Third Month; Consumer prices were 1.2% higher in February than a year earlier, the lowest annual rate of inflation since December 2016"," Feb 28, 2018",1,"The annual rate of inflation across the eurozone fell for a third straight month in February, likely reinforcing the European Central Bank's sense of caution as it considers a further withdrawal of stimulus.
According to the European Union's statistics agency, consumer prices were 1.2% higher in February than a year earlier, the lowest annual rate of inflation since December 2016 and well below the ECB's target of just under 2%.
The decline in the annual rate of inflation over the past three months had been expected by the central bank, since it is largely the result of a sharp rise in energy prices at the turn of 2017 that hasn't been repeated this year.
Even so, the slowdown underlines an apparent weakening of the relationship between economic growth and prices that has unsettled central bankers over recent years. The eurozone economy grew at its fastest pace in a decade last year , and seems set to maintain that momentum in 2018. Yet in February, the ""core"" rate of inflation that excludes volatile items such as energy and food was stuck at just 1%.
In the past, faster growth and the higher wages it brings have pushed consumer prices higher. Most ECB policy makers believe that pattern will eventually be repeated in the eurozone.
That conviction has been strengthened by a recent pickup in inflation in the U.S., where policy makers had also been puzzled by the failure of a long period of steady growth and falling unemployment to stoke higher inflation.
With consumer prices now rising at a faster pace, many investors expect the Federal Reserve to raise its key interest rate four times in 2018 , up from the three moves penciled in by officials in December.
However, most ECB policy makers acknowledge there are as yet few concrete signs that the link between growth and inflation is playing out in the eurozone.
""Inflation has yet to show more convincing signs of a sustained upward adjustment,"" ECB President Mario Draghi told lawmakers in the European Parliament on Monday.
Mr. Draghi warned lawmakers that there may be more slack in the economy than headline measures of unemployment suggest, and that ""could slow down the emergence of price pressures.""
Responding to the 2017 pickup in growth, the ECB last month cut back on one of its stimulus measures, reducing its monthly bond purchases under a program known as quantitative easing to [euro]30 billion from [euro]60 billion.
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1098 of 1177
With the inflation rate having fallen, policy makers are unlikely to take any further measures to reduce stimulus when they next meet on March 8. But their conviction that inflation will eventually pickup may be reflected in a change to a pledge they have made about their bond purchases.
As recently as last month, the ECB said it could increase its bond purchases again if the outlook for inflation worsened. The minutes of their January meeting suggest they may soon drop that pledge , perhaps next week.
But the euro's recent appreciation against the U.S. dollar is another cause for caution, since it will press down on prices of imported goods and services. Economists at HSBC think that may lead the ECB's economists to trim their forecasts for inflation when they release new projections next week, and delay a change in forward guidance.
Further steps to remove stimulus will likely require a rebound in inflation and signs the link between growth and prices remains in place, albeit more weakly than in the past. Most economists believe the February reading marks a low for 2018, with price rises set to pick up from March.
""We believe 1.2% should prove to be the low in headline inflation this year,"" said Gizem Kara, an economist at BNP Paribas. ""We expect it to accelerate on the back of higher food and energy prices over the coming months.""

HSBC,"Ad Industry's Digital Upheaval Rocks WPP; Shares Tumble; Struggling amid a slowdown in spending among clients across the industry, WPP is simplifying its structure"," Mar 1, 2018",1,"FULL TEXT
Corrections &Amplifications
Martin Sorrell is chief executive of WPP PLC. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated he was also chairman of the company. (March 2, 2018)
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1100 of 1177
Advertising's digital upheaval took a heavy toll on WPP PLC as the world's largest ad company logged its worst performance since the financial crisis, triggering jitters among investors across the sector.
On Thursday, WPP said net sales fell 0.9% on a comparable basis last year, spooking investors who were expecting signs of recovery after the company cut its forecast three times, predicting a ""broadly flat"" 2017. The firm also said it is setting budgets for 2018 on the assumption of no growth in revenue and net sales.
WPP shares tumbled 9%, and the fallout quickly spread to rival ad giants like Publicis Groupe SA, which fell 4%.
Digital disruption is leading Unilever PLC, Procter &Gamble Co. and other consumer-goods giants that once splurged on ad agency-led campaigns to redirect their spending. That is saddling ad firms with their slowest revenue growth in a decade and pressuring agency holding companies to revamp organizational structures that are out of step with the digital age. Advertisers are demanding agencies provide services that target consumers relentlessly over the internet, while coming up with traditional campaigns for print and TV.
""We have to alter our model,"" WPP Chief Executive Martin Sorrell said in an interview.
Executives like Mr. Sorrell, 73 years old, built the business model that is now being tested. He corralled different Madison Avenue agencies, such as Young &Rubicam and Ogilvy &Mather, into one large holding company while allowing those firms to run independently. Agencies kept their own finances, and creative directors called the shots, instructing big clients on how to revamp their brands.
Technological advances, however, have made it easier for clients to cut out the agency middleman, purchasing online advertising directly from platforms such as Facebook Inc. and Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc. Digital technology also eases automation in some areas of the production process, allowing brands to reuse and repurpose their advertising across different media. At the same time, WPP's biggest clients are grappling with upstart rivals, changing consumer tastes and the rise of e-commerce, putting pressure on their marketing budgets.
Ad giants have responded by moving to align the different agencies, cut costs and allow clients to work with advertising staff that previously had been siloed. WPP executives often refer to this approach as ""horizontality,"" while rival Publicis is trying to unite its operations in a restructuring dubbed ""The Power of One."" Omnicom Group Inc. has also been pushing to simplify areas like customer relationship management, national brand advertising and public relations.
This year alone, WPP has announced the merger of its public-relations firms Burson-Marsteller and Cohn &Wolfe and said that it would consolidate five of its branding agencies into one. In 2017, it combined its media agencies Maxus and MEC to form Wavemaker; moved its digital agency Possible into its customer-relationship marketing business Wunderman; and created WPP Health &Wellness out of its four large health-care agencies.
""We're clear on the destination. The changes that are taking place are pushing us to do it faster,"" Mr. Sorrell said. ""We have to simplify and focus much more on a client and country level.""
The question is whether the big ad companies can evolve fast enough. Although global ad spending still is projected to grow 4.3% this year, according to GroupM, marketers have been focused on making their ad spending more efficient. P&G, long the biggest advertiser in the world, said it reduced digital ad spending by more than $200 million last year, shifting its money to advertising platforms that help it reach a larger number of consumers in more effective ways.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1101 of 1177

Change has been particularly slow in the senior ranks of large ad holding companies. There has been no talk at WPP of Mr. Sorrell stepping down from the company he founded in 1986. His closest rival, Omnicom, is run by 65- year-old Chief Executive John Wren, who has been at the helm for more than two decades. Last year, 76-year-old Maurice Levy stepped aside as chief executive of Publicis, the third-biggest ad company, after a drawn-out process to choose Arthur Sadoun as his successor . Mr. Levy, however, remains chairman of the firm.
Succession questions have dogged WPP for several years as investors have demanded more clarity on the company's plans for life beyond Mr. Sorrell, the only chief executive the company has ever known.
Last June, Deborah Gilshan of Standard Life Investments called on the WPP board to formally set a timetable for ""an orderly management succession.""
""This remains the key governance risk to our long-term investment in WPP,"" she said.
As ad giants overhaul their operations--investing in artificial intelligence and engineering talent--they also face pressure to cut more costs to protect margins. WPP reported a 1.3% decline in fourth-quarter organic net sales, a closely watched metric in the industry that excludes currency effects and acquisitions. Analysts expected a 0.7% rise.
In the fourth quarter, organic net sales were down 3.4% in North America, 2.6% in Western Continental Europe and 3% in Asia Pacific. The bright spot was the U.K., which rose 9.1%.
""2017 for us was not a pretty year,"" Mr. Sorrell said.
WPP's closest competitors have been facing similar headwinds. Publicis posted organic growth of just 0.8% last year, while Omnicom reported lackluster fourth-quarter revenue, blaming a pullback by marketers on one-off projects and losses at some independent-branded agencies. Mr. Wren, Omnicom's CEO, said he expects the company to post softer organic growth this year compared with 2017 due to technological change, shareholder activism and new competitors.
WPP, Publicis and Omnicom have spent the past decade acquiring assets to help them adapt to the online ad business. But many of those investments ended up overlapping with their existing roster of agencies, which had begun developing their own digital skills. The duplication created confusion for clients seeking clarity about how to operate in the digital ad world.
Mr. Sorrell said during WPP's earning presentation in London on Thursday that the company is navigating the disruption by partnering with Google, Facebook and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Similarly, WPP has also been appointed by clients such like Nestle? SA and HSBC Holdings PLC to work on digital transformation projects, according to the company's investor presentation.

HSBC,"CMO Today: WPP's Weak Earnings Report; Spotify's IPO; NBCU Cuts Ad Time; Here's your morning roundup of the biggest marketing, advertising and media industry news and happenings."," Mar 1, 2018",0,"
Good morning. Marketing departments often conjure up new specialist roles so their companies can get their heads around the latest trends and technologies. Remember everyone rushing to appoint a ""head of mobile"" and ""digital evangelists""? Here's a new one: Bank of America has created an internal ""brand safety officer"" role . The new job was born out of a necessity to clean house. The bank's senior vice president and enterprise media executive Lou Paskalis said at Mobile World Congress earlier this week: ""I get a text from my chief financial officer every time there is news about a brand safety issue. I know why he is sending them to me... at some point he is going to say 'gee, is marketing safe to invest in?' and we don't want that.""
Oh You Pretty Things
WPP rounded off the agency holding company earnings season with its worst annual results since the financial crisis , which summed up a fairly shoddy 12 months across the sector. In the earnings release, Mr. Sorrell said, ""2017 for us was not a pretty year."" He blamed cost-cutting by clients engaged in zero-based budgeting and technological changes as the main contributors to the company's decline in full-year sales. WPP also warned that 2018 would be a slog, too, and set budgets on the assumption that both revenue and net sales will be flat. The antidote? ""Horizontality"": WPP's effort to simplify its vast structure of specialist shops and get its agencies working better together on client projects. We've already seen the consolidation of agencies such as the formation of Wavemaker in its media division and yesterday's merger of Burson- Marsteller and Cohn &Wolfe in the PR vertical. The company is also ""horizontalizing"" (they said it, not me) its internal systems, announcing today, for example, its production management platform Hogarth will now be rolled out for the entire company to use.

--Mediapawhoza?--
Rival agency groups have suggested 2018 may have a repeat of 2015's ""Mediapalooza,"" when a large number of clients called media reviews. But Mr. Sorrell doesn't see a Mediapalooza 2 on the horizon, saying that while there has been increased new business activity--major reviews going on at the moment include Mars, Shell and HSBC-- it's not particularly busier than any other time. WPP Finance Chief Paul Richardson even said that the $21 billion of media billings on the table three years ago wasn't dramatically more than the $18 billion that usually changes hands in a normal year. What *is* significant, according to Mark Read, CEO of WPP's Wunderman, is that a tremendous amount of the activity this time is driven by companies looking at data and how they organize their tech stack, including how they work with companies like Adobe and Salesforce.
Raising the Roof
We finally have a look under the hood of Spotify's business after the company filed to go public on Wednesday , WSJ reports. Lots to absorb from an advertising perspective. Spotify had 92 million monthly users on its ad- supported service this year, up 19% on 2016. It had 159 million monthly users in total. (Interesting that a monthly active user is counted if they consume content for ""greater than zero"" milliseconds--that's one very short song!) Ad- supported revenue grew 41% to [euro]416 million ($507 million) in 2017, which the company said was due to an increase in the number of impressions sold, driven largely by the growth in its programmatic channel. Spotify also managed to boost its average rate per impression by 7%, buoyed by the growth of its premium video offering. Elsewhere in the filing, Spotify says 62% of its users are in the coveted 18- to 34-year-old demo, and that there's a big opportunity to grow its user base by gaining share from the $28 billion global radio market.
This Is the Next Century, Where NBCUniversal's Free (Of Ads?)
Typical! A week after I suggested that the smattering of news about TV companies experimenting with reducing their ad minutage doesn't look to be escalating into a widespread trend, another network group makes a big announcement about cutting down their commercials. NBCUniversal said Wednesday that it plans to cut ad time by 10% during its original prime-time programming across its networks, CMO Today reports. NBCU also wants to reduce the number of ads per break by 20%. The network hopes to offset the reductions by running a standalone 60-second ad break at the start or the end of a show. Interestingly, Pivotal Research Group Senior Analyst Brian Wieser wrote in a research note earlier this month that NBCU was far from the worst offender as far as ad load is concerned. NBCU had average ad loads of 11.1 minutes per hour in January, roughly in the middle of the 10 national U.S. TV network groups analyzed. Viacom had the highest, at 14.6 minutes per hour.
A Time and a Placed
A newsletter exclusive: You might remember Placed as the location analytics company Snap acquired for $135 million in cash last year. Now Placed, which continues to operate independently from Snap, also wants to be remembered as the go-to metric for offline location data, the company's CEO David Shim tells me. From Thursday, any brand, agency or Placed competitor will get free access to Placed's Insights dashboard (the company will also continue to operate a paid-for premium service) to get data about the types of people that visit particular stores and which other brands and categories they have an affinity with. Mr. Shim tells me that while Nielsen is seen as the standard for TV ratings and comScore for website visits, there hasn't really been a common currency for visits in the physical world. Placed gets its location data from owned-and-operated apps. Users opt-in to share their whereabouts in the background, in exchange for rewards like airline miles or charitable donations. Mr. Shim tells

HSBC,How the Market Might React to Italy's Election; One-party or coalition populist government seen by investors as least likely--but most dangerous--outcome," Mar 2, 2018",1,"Italy goes to the polls on Sunday, voting in the country's first parliamentary election in five years, and global financial markets are sanguine about the vote.
Most analysts say a hung parliament is the most likely outcome , with no party holding a majority.
Nonetheless, investors and analysts have begun to war-game a variety of scenarios--what coalitions might be formed , and how high the risk of a euro-skeptic populist government is to investors.
The most common measure of risk, spreads between German and Italian government bond yields, has actually tightened since the beginning of the year. The FTSE MIB index of Italian stocks has outperformed the broad Stoxx Europe 600 by six percentage points in the same period.
But Italy has been regarded as a weak link in the eurozone in recent years, marred by low productivity and slow growth, and any upset in the polls could ripple through European markets.
A Center-Right Coalition
Aside from a hung parliament, a victory by a four-party coalition of the right and center-right is one of the more likely outcomes, but leaves investors with unanswered questions.
Two of the four parties in the bloc--former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the League--are roughly neck and neck in polls. How investors react may rest on which of the two comes out on top, and therefore is able to choose the prime minister.
""We might be a negative, rather than a positive, initial market reaction,"" if that decision comes down to the anti- European League, according to HSBC economist Fabio Balboni.
What's more, though regarded by many as most likely, such a government may not last the course.
""It is quite possible that the rift between the moderate and populist factions of the center-right becomes unmanageable,"" said Marco Protopapa, an economist at JPMorgan.
A Grand Coalition
A grand coalition, which could emerge if no group wins an outright majority, is seen by some investors as perhaps the least disruptive outcome, with some continuation of the slow reform process of recent years.
Such a scenario--a coalition of center-right and center-left parties with a majority in parliament--is seen as the most market-positive outcome by Lorenzo Codogno, chief economist at LC Macro Advisors.
""A centrist coalition in the future would be--somewhat paradoxically--a better outcome for markets than an outright majority of the center-right, we believe,"" said analysts at Credit Suisse in a research note this week.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1108 of 1177
JPMorgan's forecast for the spread between 10-year German and Italian government bonds suggests a grand coalition could reduce the gap, from 1.4 percentage points to around one percentage point.
However, polling has suggested that former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's Democratic Party and Mr. Berlusconi's Forza Italia would still fail to reach a majority of seats between them.
A Populist Government
A one-party or coalition populist government is seen by investors as the least likely--but most dangerous--outcome for the vote.
That outcome would either require a surprisingly strong performance by the 5 Star Movement, or an unlikely coalition forming with anti-euro parties like the League. The 5 Star Movement had previously advocated a referendum on Italy's membership in the euro, but has backed away from that pledge in recent months.
""Such a government would be viewed as a worst-case scenario by European partners and financial markets,"" said Mauro Baragiola, an analyst at Citi. ""Nevertheless, while possible on paper, we believe it unlikely to happen and impossible to last.""
JPMorgan analysts suggest a ""non-mainstream government"" could see 10-year spreads on Italian government debt surge to three percentage points.
Analysts at research house Eurasia Group suggest such an outcome has a 25% probability, as does Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management.
But most are closer to Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, who pegs the chance of the election of a populist government at just 2%.
""Markets have focused correctly on fundamentals,"" said Silvia Dall'Angelo, a senior economist at Hermes Investment Management. ""There's been a realization that an antiestablishment populist government is a distant tail risk.""
Gridlock
Of course, there is no absolute guarantee that a coalition able to govern will be established. It is possible that no grouping has the seats or the will to form a coalition government.
The country's new electoral law, a blend of first-past-the-post and proportional representation, has made victories on the part of a single party more difficult.
""Ultimately, would it be such a great surprise if Italy, which has had 62 governments since the end of World War II, does not have a proper government in place for a few months?"" said Fabrizio Quirighetti, co-head of multiasset at SYZ Asset Management. ""Maybe sometimes it's better to be ungoverned than badly governed.""

HSBC,Bank of Canada Expected to Stand Pat Amid Trade Uncertainty; Economists in a WSJ survey say the pace of rate rises this year could slow if trade relations with the U.S. worsen," Mar 6, 2018",0,"OTTAWA--The growing uncertainty over Canada's trade ties with the U.S. is reinforcing expectations that the Bank of Canada will hold its benchmark interest rate steady in its policy announcement Wednesday.
Economists from 10 of the 11 primary dealers of Canadian government securities told The Wall Street Journal they anticipate the Bank of Canada will keep the key rate at 1.25% this week. While many expect at least two interest- rate increases later in the year, several acknowledged their forecasts could be in doubt if trade relations worsen.
The 11th primary dealer, HSBC Canada, didn't participate in the survey.
Wednesday's rate decision comes less than a week after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans for global tariffs on steel and aluminum , blindsiding Canadian officials and stoking fears of a possible trade war. Meanwhile,

efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, have made limited progress. Canada sends about three quarters of its exports to the U.S., so any disruption in trade flows between the two countries would have a significant impact on the Canadian economy.
BMO Capital Markets is one of several firms forecasting two more rate increases later this year. ""Given what's unfolding in trade, there's a clear risk there might actually be less than that,"" chief economist Doug Porter said. ""I'm not too worried about the upside, I'm more worried about the downside to the rate call at this point.""
After raising the key rate by a quarter percentage point in January--the third such increase since mid-2017--the central bank said Canada's economic outlook likely would warrant higher interest rates over time. However, it said it would take a cautious approach to increases, citing uncertainty over Nafta and worries about soaring household debt.
Canada's economic outlook has faced several setbacks since then. A series of strong employment reports came to an end with January's jobs data, which saw the economy drop a net 88,000 jobs . Canada's gross domestic product came in below market expectations in the fourth quarter, and a Statistics Canada survey released last week suggests business investment could slow considerably this year, led by a pullback in the country's energy sector.
""At risk is the Bank of Canada's story that we had cause to be more optimistic because we were seeing the rotation away from excess reliance on the household sector and towards more encouraging evidence on the export and investment side of the picture,"" Bank of Nova Scotia economist Derek Holt said.
He said he doesn't expect much additional guidance from the central bank during its announcement this week.
""There's so much uncertainty hanging in the air that I think [the central bank] will want to make this one largely a maintenance statement and not rock the boat too much in either direction,"" Mr. Holt said.
This week marks the first time the Bank of Canada will provide an update on the country's economic outlook after issuing an interest-rate decision that isn't accompanied by a monetary policy report. Bank of Canada deputy governor Timothy Lane will deliver an economic progress report in a speech in Vancouver, British Columbia, on Thursday.

Shares of industrial and materials firms pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 lower for the third straight session Wednesday, as investors weighed new signs that protectionist trade policies could spread.
Stocks had come under pressure earlier in the month as investors worried that U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum could hurt firms that use the metals to manufacture goods. And some are concerned that other countries might retaliate, slowing international trade and eventually weakening global economic growth.
While the White House appeared to soften its initial stance on trade policy last week, helping stocks recoup some of their losses , stocks and bond yields came under fresh pressure Wednesday after the Commerce Department signaled that few product exclusions to the tariffs would be granted to U.S. firms.
Germany's newly re-elected chancellor, Angela Merkel, also said the European Union needs to respond with one voice to the U.S. tariffs and shouldn't be afraid to impose its own trade measures, if necessary.
""It just seems like the market is kind of resigning itself to this trade-war narrative,"" said Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist at JonesTrading. ""Sentiment is fragile right now.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 248.91 points, or 1%, at 24758.12, after opening higher. The S&P 500 dropped 15.83 points, or 0.6%, to 2749.48, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 14.20 points, or 0.2%, to 7496.81.
Aerospace giant Boeing was among the worst performers in the blue-chip index Wednesday, sliding $8.41, or 2.5%, to $330.26, and slicing 58 points off the Dow industrials.
Shares of materials companies fell 1.3% in the S&P 500, with all but one stock in the sector posting losses for the day, while the S&P 500 industrials sector lost 1.1%.
Despite renewed trade worries, stocks have largely stabilized following a wave of volatility in February that sent the S&P 500 and Dow industrials into correction territory.
The S&P is 4.3% away from its all-time high set Jan. 26, while the Dow industrials are 7% away from their Jan. 26 record.
Investors attribute stocks' recovery to recent data pointing to more measured economic growth, which they hope will keep the Federal Reserve on a gradual path of interest-rate increases.
Last month, many investors feared that significantly higher inflation would give the Fed a freer hand to raise rates more quickly than anticipated, pushing up bond yields and making stocks less attractive.
""That's a very legitimate debate for the market to have and for the market to be worried about,"" said Ben Laidler, global equity strategist and head of Americas research at HSBC. ""We're definitely in the slightly-more-sanguine camp.""
Still, division among investors over interest-rate increases could continue contributing to market swings, analysts say.
On Wednesday, the Labor Department said a gauge of U.S. business prices rose 0.2% in February, a sign of modest

inflation pressure . Americans cut spending at retailers in February for the third consecutive month despite receiving bigger paychecks, the Commerce Department said.
Shares of department stores and apparel sellers fell following the downbeat retail sales data. Kohl's shed 1.86, or 2.9%, to 62.25, while Nordstrom declined 85 cents, or 1.7%, to 49.48.
Signet Jewelers shares tumbled 9.69, or 20%, to 38.22 after the jewelry seller said same-store sales fell more than expected in the most recent quarter.
Meanwhile, government bonds strengthened, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note slipping to 2.815% Wednesday from 2.848% a day earlier. Yields fall as prices rise.
Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 closed down 0.1%, as trade concerns offset gains in mining companies, which surged after better-than-expected Chinese economic data boosted commodity prices. China is the world's largest consumer of raw materials.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi warned Wednesday that the bank isn't yet ready to end its giant bond-buying program, pointing to new threats from U.S. trade restrictions and a strengthening euro.
Weakness in technology firms hurt major Asian indexes. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average fell 0.9%, while the Shanghai Composite Index declined 0.6%.

HSBC,Activist Investor Takes Major Stake in Barclays; Move by Edward Bramson's fund comes as the bank is more than two years into a restructuring that has yet to pay off," Mar 19, 2018",1,"Barclays PLC came under further pressure to step up turnaround plans after activist investor Sherborne Investors said Monday it has taken a 5.2% stake in the bank.
Sherborne, founded by investor Edward Bramson, hasn't said if it plans to seek any changes at the British bank, whose share price has lagged behind rivals in part because of questions about its business strategy combining investment banking, credit cards, and retail and commercial banking. In previous investments in U.K. investment companies F&C Asset Management PLC and Electra Private Equity PLC, Sherborne successfully pushed for strategic changes and took board seats.
The entry of the activist comes at a sticky time for Barclays, more than two years into a restructuring that has yet to pay off. Barclays was one of the worst-performing European bank stocks last year, and some shareholders have questioned whether Chief Executive Jes Staley has hit on the right strategy. In February, Mr. Staley said his turnaround plan is about to pay off and that the return of volatility to markets was helping boost trading revenue at Barclays's investment bank.
Mr. Staley also pledged to double the bank's dividend , helping lift the stock 4.5% between the Feb. 21 announcement and last Friday. The shares rose another 4% Monday on news of the Sherborne stake.
Sherborne's stake building started late last year and is a relatively rare example of an activist investor targeting a bank. The banking sector scares off many activists since regulators have a much greater say over business plans and capital levels than in other industries. Even so, last year, Swiss hedge fund RBR Capital Advisors AG took a crack at getting Credit Suisse Group AG to break itself up --with no success so far--while earlier attempts by Monaco-based Knight Vinke Asset Management to bring about changes at HSBC Holdings PLC and UBS Group AG largely failed. A 2007 effort by London hedge fund TCI Fund Management to get Dutch bank ABN Amro to shed operations was a relative success but led to the disastrous acquisition of the Dutch bank by Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC and two other banks. The takeover was good for ABN shareholders, including TCI, but RBS had to be bailed out a year later by the British government.
People familiar with the matter said Barclays and Sherborne officials met after the bank's full-year results in February but that there hasn't been any contact yet with Barclays board. The people said Sherborne hasn't indicated any specific changes it might seek. Over the course of an investment, Sherborne typically aims to make at least double its initial investment--some £1.8 billion ($2.53 billion) in the case of Barclays.
Barclays said Monday it will ""continue to engage with Sherborne"" but didn't give any details. Any activist action against the bank would add to a host a pressures: In addition to the continuing restructuring, Barclays is defending itself against U.K. criminal charges over a 2008 emergency fundraising from Middle Eastern investors and is in the process of legally separating its retail and investment banks to meet new, so-called ringfencing rules. The bank is also waiting to hear if any action will be taken by U.K. regulators over attempts by Mr. Staley last year to identify a whistleblower who sent letters criticizing an executive he hired.
Over its three-year investment in F&C, Sherborne pressured the company to reduce its debt and refocus its strategy. When the company resisted, it rallied other shareholders and installed Mr. Bramson as chairman. Sherborne doubled its money by the time it cashed out in 2013.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1123 of 1177
Sherborne hasn't always forced changes on targets, though. In 2013 it invested in private-equity firm 3i Group PLC, then cashed out later that year at a double-digit profit saying it saw better opportunities elsewhere.
In Barclays, Sherborne made around one-third of the £1.8 billion stock-and-derivative investment through a company it listed in Guernsey in July. The Guernsey company's stated aim was to find a single corporate target to invest in and make ""a significant capital return.""
It started building the Barclays stake last year, the people familiar with the matter said. At the February meeting, Barclays met with Sherborne as one of its top-five shareholders. At the time, it was just below the 5% stake that triggered the disclosure Monday under U.K. listing rules.

HSBC,Citigroup Bolsters Investment Banking Ranks With Eye on Cash-Rich Private-Equity Firms; Alexis Maskell to join with Citi's Shawn Borisoff to oversee the bank's EMEA alternative assets group," Mar 21, 2018",0,"Citigroup Inc. has hired a veteran banker of HSBC Holdings PLC and Deutsche Bank to co-head its coverage of private equity, sovereign-wealth funds, pension funds and family office clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, in an effort to take advantage of the record amounts of money this group has to invest.
Based in London, Alexis Maskell will join with Citigroup's Shawn Borisoff and together the two will oversee the U.S. bank's EMEA alternative assets group, a spokeswoman confirmed. Mr. Maskell, who is set to start his new role in June, most recently was global head of HSBC's investment-banking operations focused on private-equity firms. Before that he spent 10 years at Deutsche Bank.
He will report to Anthony Diamandakis and Christian Anderson, global co-head of Citigroup's Global Asset Managers group.
Mr. Maskell's hiring comes at a time when institutional investors are plowing money into infrastructure funds and private-equity firms to diversify from public securities and seek higher returns. Last year, Apollo Global Management LLC raised $23.5 billion a buyout fund while CVC Capital Partners set a fundraising record for Europe, attracting 16 billion euros ($19.6 billion). The challenge now is for these and other cash-rich funds to find new investments, creating advisory opportunities for investment banks on deals pursued by this group of investors.
At the same time, the client base for investment banks that focus on buyout firms and other private investors is expanding as pension funds and family offices---investment vehicles set up by ultrarich investors--and infrastructure funds increasingly compete against traditional buyout firms in the acquisition and sale of assets.
""With the amount of capital that has been raised globally, I would expect in the next few years for there to be very large buyouts of public companies or big carve outs of their divisions"", said Mr. Diamandakis. ""I would also expect a big focus on portfolio monetizations at this point in the cycle,"" as buyout firms take the advantage of the demand for assets, he said.

Tuesday, the WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of 16 other currencies, added 0.3%.
Anticipation that protectionist trade policies by the U.S. and China could fuel a global trade war had hurt the dollar and stocks in recent weeks, with some investors worried that higher input costs would eventually lead to slower global growth. That anxiety also boosted gold, which some investors favor when they think markets might turn rocky.
Reduced market risk ""effectively cuts off the oxygen for the gold rally,"" said James Steel, chief precious metals analyst at HSBC.
But a weekend Wall Street Journal report that the U.S. and China have quietly started negotiating to improve U.S. access to Chinese markets has calmed some investors and weakened safe-haven demand early in the week, some analysts said.
Investors will be monitoring economic data and central-bank signals moving forward, as gold struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets like Treasurys when interest rates rise. The Federal Reserve last week raised interest rates and said it plans to raise rates two more times this year, quelling some investor fears that the central bank might get much more aggressive in 2018 to keep the economy in check.
Still, some analysts expect the factors driving gold to remain balanced, leading to relatively muted price moves.
""They seem to be offsetting and leaving you in this rangebound market,"" said Rob Haworth, a senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
Among base metals, front-month copper for March delivery added 1% to $2.9915 a pound in its second day of gains in the last nine sessions. The industrial metal has fallen 8.8% so far this year after hitting a roughly four-year high late in December, hurt by weak economic data out of China, the world's largest copper consumer, and worries about trade policies.
The labor strikes that boosted copper last year also haven't materialized this year, though some investors expect supply disruptions and stronger economic data to boost the red metal moving forward.
""With headlines around 'trade wars' becoming slightly less negative, it seems people have been encouraged to unwind the Armageddon trade and this is seeing short covering across the board both in the West and in Asia,"" said Matt France, head of institutional sales for metals at brokerage Marex Spectron, of the broad climb in metals and other risk assets Tuesday.

HSBC,"Lagging Miners Send Bearish Signal for Gold; Gold prices are up 1.4% this year, but stocks of companies that mine the metal are down"," Mar 28, 2018",1,"
Shares of gold miners have fared worse than the precious metal itself over the past year--a development that is fueling concern about bullion's ability to keep climbing.
Gold is up 1.4% so far this year, outpacing the S&P 500, which is down 2.6%, and the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, which has fallen 7%. The divergence between gold and companies that mine it became particularly pronounced starting in late January, when stocks in other sectors attracted more interest from investors. Among the largest producers, Barrick Gold Corp. has fallen 12% year to date.
Typically, gold-mining stocks tend to be more volatile than gold itself. But that usually occurs in a different fashion: Miners tend to experience outsize losses when the gold price is falling and typically overshoot when prices rally.
The current deviation from that trend is a worrying development for investors who are bullish on gold, as it suggests metal prices might not keep rising as interest rates increase.
It also is concerning bullish investors that gold, a haven for investors during market turbulence, is struggling despite recent stock slides on worries about trade disruptions and a decline in long-term bond yields.
While both should be positive for gold, prices fell 1.3% to $1,324.20 a troy ounce Wednesday in a second straight session of declines. That creates uncertainty about gold's ability to sustain this year's gains.
""As soon as angst leaves the market on something like trade or geopolitical tensions, then gold begins to accommodate the fact that we're in a tightening cycle,"" said James Steel, chief precious metals analyst at HSBC.
Higher interest rates tend to buoy Treasury yields and make gold less attractive by comparison. The dollar has also been rebounding , which has cooled some optimism for gold bugs, analysts said. A stronger dollar makes commodities denominated in the currency more expensive for overseas buyers.
Gold miners have underperformed despite a strong fourth-quarter earnings season and upbeat 2018 projections. One reason is that some of the companies still aren't generating as much cash as miners of other metals such as copper, analysts said.
In 2017, gold prices had their best year since 2010 , allowing many miners to repair their balance sheets. Barrick Gold, the world's largest producer, said it paid down $1.5 billion in debt, exceeding its target, while Newmont Mining Corp. reported an 8% rise in production from a year earlier.
But the companies still haven't caught up in free cash flow relative to market value, a commonly-used metric for evaluating performance, according to Citigroup research.
""It takes some momentum to get people to come back to a sector that has been beaten as badly as mining has,"" said Matt Badiali, research analyst at investment research firm Banyan Hill Publishing.
  PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1138 of 1177
Mr. Badiali said he spoke at the Prospectors &Developers Association of Canada convention in Toronto this month, pointing out that gold miners have recently improved earnings, paid down debts and are cheap after a yearslong slump.
""This crowd was so mad"" and took issue with his optimistic outlook, a sign that investor sentiment needs to improve before the sector's outlook can brighten, he said.
Sentiment for gold miners has been negative, while investors have largely remained positive on the broader stock market and been drawn to other commodities, from cobalt to oil. ""Speculative money has other places to go,"" Mr. Badiali said.
Still, some think gold's climb will continue as money managers seek hedges against inflation and market swings, eventually leading to better performance by the beaten-down miners of the yellow metal.
Gold futures are still 30% below their 2011 all-time highs even after a 14% gain last year, and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF is almost 70% below its 2011 record.
Bouts of volatility have boosted the exchange-traded fund, which recorded inflows in six straight sessions through Tuesday. And some select gold miners such as Newmont, which is up 13% since the start of last year, have attracted investor interest by demonstrating future production will be steady.
But others think the gold-mining sector will have to demonstrate more consistency to close the gap on gold.
""It's in a very tough spot,"" said Mark Stoeckle, CEO and senior portfolio manager of Adams Funds. ""What some people are doing is assuming that because [mining stocks are] beaten up, they will come back--not necessarily.""

HSBC,"Angolan Ex-President's Son and Others Suspected of $500 Million Central Bank Fraud Using U.K. Lenders; People familiar with case say money was transferred through HSBC, Standard Chartered accounts before being frozen"," Mar 29, 2018",1,"The former Angolan president's son and a former central banker are suspected of using accounts at HSBC Holdings PLC and Standard Chartered PLC in an attempt to defraud the country's central bank by transferring $500 million through these U.K.-based lenders, people familiar with the matter said.
The prosecutor's office in Angola said the money was transferred from Angola's central bank, allegedly to guarantee a $30 billion financing deal, according to a statement posted on the government website Wednesday.
According to one of the people familiar with the matter, a document showed the $500 million went to a Credit Suisse account, but that document was forged. Instead, the money turned up at an account at HSBC, where it was flagged to authorities and frozen, said the people familiar with the matter.
Earlier this week, Angolan prosecutors named as suspects in the allegedly illegal transfer from the central bank, Jose? Filomeno dos Santos, the son of former President Jose? Eduardo dos Santos, and four others, including the former Angolan central bank governor, Valter Filipe da Silva, according to the government statement.
Mr. da Silva couldn't be reached for comment, but has previously denied wrongdoing. Representatives of Angola's central bank couldn't be reached for comment. Jose? Filomeno dos Santos couldn't be reached for comment.
In a statement read during an Angola news-channel broadcast on Tuesday, Jose? Filomeno dos Santos, who until January ran the country's sovereign-wealth fund, said he voluntarily reached out to the prosecutor's office in late February ""to collaborate in finding the truth."" He confirmed that he has been named on March 6 as a suspect in the case. ""Mr. dos Santos remains available to continue to cooperate with authorities to completely and satisfactory resolve this process,"" said the statement that the news presenter read.
The documents that indicated the $500 million went to a Credit Suisse account are now being investigated by the Angolan central bank, according to one of the people familiar with the matter.
In a statement, Credit Suisse said it ""has no record of the alleged fraud, which involved falsified documentation, and has not received any funds in relation to it."" The company also said it ""has provided available information to relevant law enforcement agencies.""
Standard Chartered said on Wednesday that the funds used in the alleged attempted fraud came from the Angolan central bank's Standard Chartered account. It said it is working closely with the central bank and U.K. law enforcement.
The U.K.'s National Crime Agency said this week it is investigating the ""potential $500 million fraud"" and that it froze the entire sum in December. It said it is preparing to return the money to Angola, while it continues its investigation in cooperation with authorities there.
Both HSBC and Standard Chartered have previously been sanctioned by authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere over lax money-laundering controls, but in recent years have strengthened their ability to detect such crimes, a necessity to avoid the possibility of losing a banking license. The U.K. also has strengthened its financial crime- fighting powers and was able to freeze the Angolan money because of new laws that came in last year.
The prosecutor's naming of Jose? Filomeno dos Santos as a suspect comes at a time when Angola's new president , Joa?o Lourenc?o is escalating a purge of family members and allies of his predecessor from government posts.

Jose? Filomeno dos Santos was named as chairman of Angola's sovereign-wealth fund by his father in 2013 to oversee the investment of $5 billion on behalf of the country. Mr. Lourenc?o replaced the fund's entire board in January.
Jose? Eduardo dos Santos, who remains the leader of Mr. Lourenc?o's ruling MPLA party, stepped down in September after 38 years at the helm of the southern African country.
After ending three decades of civil war in 2002, Jose? Eduardo dos Santos oversaw an oil boom that turned Angola into the continent's second-largest crude producer, behind Nigeria. Yet his tenure was marred by allegations of nepotism and widespread looting of public coffers while the majority of Angola's 30 million citizens continued to live in poverty. Mr. dos Santos and his appointees have denied the allegations.
In November, Mr. Lourenc?o dismissed Isabel dos Santos, one of the former president's daughters and Africa's richest woman , according to Forbes magazine, as the head of the state oil company, Sonangol. Angolan authorities have said they are investigating Ms. dos Santos in connection with missing funds from Sonangol. She has denied the allegations.

HSBC,"Get Ready for Another LNG Boom; While overall fossil-fuel demand has slowed, LNG is seen growing by 4% to 5% a year through 2040"," Apr 2, 2018",1,"
Natural gas that is supercooled and shipped around the world may be the only big growth market for the fossil- fuels industry.
Last week, Lorenzo Simonelli, chief executive of oil-field-services giant Baker Hughes, a GE Company, painted a bullish long-term picture. While overall fossil-fuel demand has slowed, liquefied natural gas is seen growing by 4% to 5% a year through 2040. He said the industry was surprised by how quickly demand grew last year, especially in China , and that the company sees the market getting tight by 2022.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1143 of 1177
But it already was tight six or seven years ago with Asian spot prices as high as three times today's level. Then LNG megaprojects from offshore Australia to Qatar and Russia caused projected supply to outstrip booming demand. Partly built projects were shelved and some existing operators were forced to alter contracts on terms advantageous to buyers. Other buyers chose not to lock themselves in to 15- to 20-year contracts linked to oil prices. Now contracts are about a third as long with more wiggle room.
That is a problem for anyone seeking to finance a new project costing billions of dollars. Analysts at HSBC point out that only 12 million tons per annum of capacity were added in 2016 and 2017--about half the pace of 2009 through 2014 and not enough to meet projected demand. Growth in consumption just last year was 27 million tons.
One solution might be convincing banks to take on more risk, financing projects where only half of sales were contracted, not 70% or more. Another might be for wild-eyed equity investors to assume more risk. That is what is happening in the U.S. where plenty of cash seems to be pouring into facilities to export shale gas following the stunning success of pioneer Cheniere Energy. Yet another way to get projects running, according to the HSBC analysts, might be for oil-field-services companies like Baker Hughes to chip in some money themselves as investors.
Given the fairly long time it takes to approve and build a project, though, the market might provide the solution by getting tight again due to lack of new capacity. Sky-high spot gas prices would then attract a wave of investment, eventually leading to the next crash in prices.
The LNG market, long a staid cousin to oil, is starting to resemble it more and more every year--for better and for worse.

HSBC,WPP Settles Lawsuit Alleging Misconduct by Former Ad-Agency Head; Settlement comes as WPP's board investigates an allegation of personal misconduct by CEO Martin Sorrell," Apr 4, 2018",0,"WPP PLC has settled a lawsuit brought by an employee that alleged racist and sexist behavior by a top executive at one of the advertising giant's premier agencies, ending a legal dispute that helped raise awareness about inappropriate behavior on Madison Avenue.
Erin Johnson, chief communications officer of the WPP-owned agency J. Walter Thompson, is receiving a substantial settlement, a person familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal, which first reported news of the agreement Wednesday.
In her 2016 lawsuit, Ms. Johnson alleged that JWT's then-chief executive, Gustavo Martinez, engaged in a pattern of misconduct that amounted to gender discrimination and a violation of her civil rights.
In a statement, JWT confirmed it had reached the settlement and declined to disclose the terms. The company said Ms. Johnson has resigned from her role at the agency.
Shortly after Ms. Johnson filed the lawsuit, Mr. Martinez left his post as CEO of JWT. A WPP spokesman said Mr. Martinez is currently working on assignments in Spain for WPP.
Ms. Johnson said in statement, ""The past few years have been challenging to say the least, and I am grateful for the love and encouragement from family, friends and those of you in the industry who spoke up and offered support."" She added, ""I hope that my personal experience will encourage others to speak up and follow their convictions.""
News of the settlement comes as WPP's board is investigating allegations of personal misconduct by the company's chief executive, Martin Sorrell. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the board is looking into whether Mr. Sorrell misused company assets. The company confirmed it is investigating Mr. Sorrell, who has denied any misconduct.
Madison Avenue has struggled to move beyond the perception that the advertising world is hostile to women and lacks diversity. Ms. Johnson's case helped reignite debate over workplace behavior in the industry--even before the broader #MeToo movement took off. JWT is a storied ad agency whose clients include Macy's, Ford, Kimberly- Clark and HSBC.

Ms. Johnson's lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York, named as defendants Mr. Martinez, JWT and WPP.
It alleged she was subjected to a hostile work environment, and that Mr. Martinez engaged in an ""unending stream of racist and sexist comments as well as unwanted touching and other unlawful conduct."" The complaint claimed that in conversations with colleagues Mr. Martinez referred to personnel at airports as ""black monkeys"" and ""apes"" who don't know how to use computers.

HSBC,European Buyers Go Shopping for U.S. Companies; The drop in the U.S. corporate tax rate makes American businesses more alluring to European buyers," Apr 6, 2018",1,"European executives are targeting U.S. companies as a brighter economic landscape at home and abroad boosts buyer confidence.
Lower taxes and favorable foreign exchange rates are increasingly enticing for France's JCDecaux SA, which has looked at U.S. rivals as potential acquisition targets for more than a decade.
""The change in the U.S. tax rate will make it more attractive for us to pursue such a deal,"" said finance chief David Bourg.
European companies spent $47.26 billion on U.S. targets since the beginning of the year, through April 5, according to Dealogic. That is the highest deal value for this period since 2006 and up from $37.59 billion worth of deals struck in the same period last year.
The total number of European acquisitions of U.S. companies declined to 113 in that period of 2018 from 172 in that part of 2017, according to Dealogic, an indication that this year's deals are often larger.
Sanofi SA, the French pharmaceuticals company, and AXA SA, the French insurance company, have both made big
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1150 of 1177
U.S. transactions, with Sanofi spending over $11.4 billion for Waltham, Mass.-based Bioverativ Inc. in January. AXA in March said it would buy XL Group Ltd. for $15.3 billion.
The drop in the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21% makes U.S. businesses more alluring to European buyers, as does the pullback in the U.S. dollar, which is down nearly 15% against the euro since Dec. 2016.
Wa?rtsila? Corp., the Finnish maker of marine engines and power plants, is planning to spend hundreds of millions of euros on acquisitions this year . The company is following 15 to 20 companies, including some in the U.S., said CFO Marco Wiren.
""We are continuously looking for new targets,"" Mr. Wiren said. ""The corporate tax reform and the sound business environment make it more attractive to invest in the U.S.,"" he added. Wa?rtsila? is prepared to spend [euro]60 million to [euro]400 million ($73.5 million to $490.1 million) per transaction to complement its portfolio, Mr. Wiren said.
European companies are eager buyers because of strong cash reserves, the result of years of conservative spending, in addition to the availability of cheap funding as interest rates remain near historic lows.
Smurfit Kappa Group PLC, Europe's largest paper packaging producer, also is looking for targets abroad , including the U.S. The company reiterated its appetite for acquisitions after Tennessee-based International Paper Co. in late March made a second bid to buy the Irish firm, which Smurfit Kappa rejected.
""The U.S. is a growing market in terms of our business,"" Smurfit Kappa CFO Ken Bowles said, adding that a larger footprint in the U.S. would allow the company to take advantage of bright economic prospects.
The company's last sizable U.S. transaction was the acquisition of a company called Bates Container LLC for $150 million that closed in 2015.
However, uncertainty about Washington's stance on foreign takeovers could make some buyers pause. President Donald Trump blocked the takeover of Qualcomm Inc. in March , citing concerns about national security.
Deal makers are also likely to proceed with caution amid escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China, which have triggered wild swings in global markets.
""The volatility has certainly increased,"" said Philipp Beck, a managing director in UBS Group AG's mergers and acquisitions team. ""This is certainly not helpful for transactions,"" he said. A long-lasting trade conflict between the U.S. and China would also discourage deal making, bankers say.
European buyers must also contend with sticker shock, as U.S. companies often trade at higher valuations than their European peers. Companies in the S&P 500 command an average trailing price earnings ratio of 18.9, compared with 15.1 for the Stoxx Europe 600, according to Thomson Reuters Corp.
""The historic valuation asymmetry has been partially compensated for by the weaker U.S. dollar,"" said Borja Azpilicueta, who advises companies in Europe and elsewhere at HSBC Holdings PLC. ""But there is still a relative valuation premium for many U.S. firms,"" he said.
And while the weaker dollar can temper the cost of a U.S. company, it also takes a toll on the income a European buyer would get from a U.S. target.

JCDecaux's Mr. Bourg knows that he might have to put a big offer on the table. ""The price of the potential acquisition targets has always been very high,"" he said.

Many large-cap European stocks, including Vodafone, Nestle?, and Rio Tinto, offer hefty, sustainable yields
THE STOXX EUROPE 600 INDEX HAS FALLEN 3.4% this year, and the FTSE 100 index, which tracks the largest companies trading on the London Stock Exchange, has dropped 6.4%.
No matter the index, the story is the same: European stocks have been in a slump. Investors are worried about a stronger euro relative to the U.S. dollar, which could crimp the overseas profits of European multinational companies. Additionally, they have been questioning just how durable European growth really is.
Some European companies offer lofty dividend yields, and have the ability to cover their payouts with operating earnings and expand them over time. These characteristics could make their shares a welcome refuge in a slower- growth environment. The nearby table lists 10 European large-cap dividend plays, all with U.S.-traded shares, or American depositary receipts.
U.S. companies typically pay ordinary dividends on a quarterly basis, but that isn't the case in Europe. United Kingdom companies usually pay dividends twice a year, and European companies make disbursements annually, notes Ben Lofthouse, head of global equity income at Janus Henderson Investors, who also helps manage the $5.7 billion Janus Henderson Global Equity Income fund (ticker: HFQAX). The fund's 12-month trailing yield is about 6.3%.
Many European companies pay dividends in the period stretching from April through July.
When U.K. companies pay dividends twice a year, the amounts often vary. Case in point: HSBC Holdings' (HSBC) latest payout (for ADR holders), disbursed this month, totals $1.05 a share, compared with 50 cents last fall.
Growth worries aside, this could be a good time for U.S. investors to stock up on European dividend payers. Valuations look attractive, with many stocks trading at low- to mid-teen multiples of currentyear earnings estimates. Yields on our list range from 2.96% for Nestle? (NSRGY), the packaged-foods giant, to 6.33% for Vodafone Group (VOD), the U.K.-based telecom company with extensive wireless operations in Britain, continental Europe, and elsewhere. The FTSE 350 index, which tracks the 350 largest companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, was yielding 4% recently, close to its 20-year high, not including the 2007-08 financial crisis.
Ron Temple, head of U.S. equity at Lazard Asset Management, said in a recent client note that the euro-zone expansion has broadened, driven by domestic demand, and that ""significant runway"" exists for additional growth. He is worried, however, that the odds of a monetary-policy mistake could lengthen in 2018.
Like the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank bought Dividend up assets postcrisis to drive Payments, down interest rates and page M31 stimulate economic growth.
The ECB has been cautious to date about ending its stimulus regime.
Based on dividend forecasts for the next 12 months, companies in the MSCI Europe index yield 3.8%, and U.K.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1156 of 1177
companies yield 4.6%, according to Morgan Stanley. (Excluding financial stocks, the yield is 3.5%.) By comparison, the MSCI World Index yields 2.6%.
Lofthouse, of Janus Henderson, holds shares of mining companies Rio Tinto (RIO) and BHP Billiton (BHP) in his fund. (BHP Billiton is based in Australia, but has a U.K. listing; Rio Tinto is based in the U.K.) Both companies cut their payouts in 2016 as commodities prices tanked. At recent prices, BHP's 12-month yield is 4.51%, and Rio Tinto's is 5.8%. A 12-month yield factors in dividends paid out over the past year.
The mining companies currently are generating substantial cash flow, Lofthouse notes. But dividends might fluctuate with commodity prices, he cautions. Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) arguably offers a less-cyclical business model and geographic diversity. It owns about two-thirds of T-Mobile US (TMUS), the third-largest wireless carrier in the U.S. T-Mobile has been growing rapidly in recent years.
Morgan Stanley recently upgraded Deutsche Telekom to Overweight, partly due to ""better top-line and Ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization] dynamics in Germany.""
Deutsche Telekom's 12-month yield was 4.25% recently. By comparison, Verizon Communications (VZ) yields 4.9%, and AT&T (T), 5.6%.
Lloyds Banking Group (LYG) is another U.K.-based holding in the Janus Henderson fund. Lloyds has a big retailbanking footprint and operations in insurance and commercial banking. It recently fetched less than 10 times this year's profit estimates, and it was yielding 4.5%.
Some European countries impose a dividend withholding tax on nonresidents; the tax applies to ADRs and shares purchased on foreign exchanges. Switzerland, Germany, and France impose a 15% tax; the U.K. doesn't tax nonresident stockholders.
In many cases, U.S. tax filers can offset the liability with a credit from the Internal Revenue Service.
U.S. investors buying European-listed shares also should be aware of currency risk. If the dollar strengthens against the euro, it erodes returns converted back into dollars, unless they are hedged.
Conversely, a weaker dollar can help boost returns for U.S. investors, which has been the case more recently. ? email: lawrence.strauss@barrons.com"

HSBC,China Takes New Step Toward Opening Its Financial Markets to the World; Beijing pledges to launch stock trading link between Shanghai and London," Apr 11, 2018",1,"SHANGHAI--China has pledged to launch a stock trading link between Shanghai and London by the end of this year, taking a fresh step towards opening up its financial markets and providing the U.K. with a vote of confidence ahead of Brexit.
The plan, announced by China's central bank governor Yi Gang at a forum on Wednesday, is part of a suite of new measures aimed at further widening foreign investors' access to China's financial sector. It follows President Xi Jinping's relatively soothing rhetoric on trade ties with the U.S. in a speech Tuesday.
The so-called Shanghai-London Stock Connect program will come after Beijing moved in recent years to allow global investors to
trade on its two domestic stock markets , Shenzhen and Shanghai, via similar trading links with Hong Kong. Those trading links have enabled billions of dollars to flow between Hong Kong and mainland bourses each day.
However, the new program may not prove as popular as its predecessors--at least initially.
""Its impact is certainly more symbolic than material for now,"" said Wu Zhaoyin, chief strategist at AVIC Trust Co.
The substantial time difference between London and Shanghai, currently seven hours, means investors in either location would have to trade very early in the morning or late into the night, Mr. Wu said. Moreover, the lack of knowledge of London-listed stocks among Chinese investors, especially the country's nearly 90 million retail investors, could also hinder demand.
""Night shifts mean very small trading volume,"" he said. ""I can only think of HSBC off the top of my head, if you ask me about stocks in London.""
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1160 of 1177
The planned Shanghai-London trading link will likely be a replica of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect program, which Beijing unveiled in November 2014. The trading link allows qualified mainland investors to buy and sell shares in the Hong Kong market, a factor that has helped boost trading volumes there.
Such bilateral arrangements by Beijing to connect foreign markets with its own reflect both its gradualist reform approach and its persistent concerns about capital flight. The current trading links between mainland China and Hong Kong are structured in a way that means money flowing in either direction can only be used to buy stocks.
""Based on the current mechanism, every outbound deal is also settled onshore for Chinese investors. It's a closed loop,"" said Wendy Liu, Hong Kong-based head of China equity research at Nomura International.
Given China's creaky financial system and high debt buildup, Beijing is keen to maintain a tight grip on the pace of financial liberalization and capital flows, analysts say.
""We can't deal with it if we open the door too wide and too fast,"" said Liu Weiming, founder of Beijing-based Fuxi Investment Management Ltd.

HSBC,Why Volatile Markets Are Good News for Careful Investors; February's selloff and subsequent turbulence have restored some normality," Apr 19, 2018",0,"Managing money involves a balancing act that trades off risk against return. This year is proving more challenging, with stocks and bonds swinging about. But it also shows how a return to a more normal level of market volatility might be good news for careful investors.
Usually, the higher potential returns that equities offer versus bonds come at a price: they are more volatile. That is why the classic 60-40 portfolio allocation ratio, with a higher allocation to stocks but a dose of bond ballast, makes a good deal of sense: it is tilted toward better returns but should perform better than stocks alone in troubled times.
For much of 2017, however, picking between stocks and bonds really didn't matter. Volatility was crushed everywhere, data from quantitative strategists at HSBC show. Portfolios composed 80-20 in favor of global stocks and 80-20 in favor of global bonds exhibited similar, very low volatility.
In other words, last year there was a rare opportunity: a free pass to buy equities and chase higher returns, which were handsome, with stocks globally, measured by the MSCI World index, up 20%.
The last time volatility across asset classes was similarly compressed in this way was 2004 to 2006, the period before the global financial crisis. In fact, back then, it persisted for longer. This time, February's selloff and subsequent turbulence have restored some measure of normality.
Too long a period in which return-chasing behavior is only rewarded, rather than corrected, leads to poor investment decisions and an underpricing of risks. That offers one reason to welcome the return of volatility , even if it is a tougher environment for investors. Asset allocation matters again.

HSBC,"HSBC CEO Says Overhaul Strategy 'Is Working'; At annual shareholders meeting, Flint says U.K. bank needs 'to keep evolving'"," Apr 20, 2018",0,"HSBC Holdings PLC Chief Executive John Flint spent the past seven years watching the bank undergo a radical overhaul under former boss Stuart Gulliver. On Friday, he signaled much of the heavy lifting is done and that his leadership will be a period of evolution not revolution.
""The strategy we have is working,"" Mr. Flint told shareholders at an annual meeting in London. ""But we now need to keep evolving it and to deliver at pace.""
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1166 of 1177
Mr. Flint started as CEO in February after holding an array of top posts in 29 years at HSBC. He took over a bank in pared-down shape after exiting from dozens of businesses in the past several years and withdrawing from countries where it lacked scale or profitability.
On the sidelines of the shareholder meeting, Mr. Flint said he is still working on a strategy update to present to investors this summer. Analysts expect the plans to include more exits from certain retail markets and a possible merger or acquisitions for HSBC's asset-management arm, among other moves.
Mr. Flint played down any potential announcements about leaving countries, saying it is unfair to employees and could diminish returns from any sale.
""We just have to figure out what our priorities are going to be and what our targets are going to be,"" he said. ""We will communicate as much as we reasonably can but it won't have a forward-looking list of everything we're going to do in the next three years.""
Mr. Flint said the bank can't realistically set any aggressive new targets until it meets current ones such as reaching a 10% return on equity. In 2017, the return was 5.9%.
""We've got to get to 10 first. Do I think the organization's got the potential for more than that? Look at our business in Asia, look at our business in the Middle East. The organization's got potential for more, but you've got to be credible in getting to the current target,"" he said.
The restructuring overseen by Mr. Gulliver marked a reckoning for a bank that had grown far from its 1860s roots as a Hong Kong trade bank into one of the largest in the world. Weakened both financially and reputationally by a disastrous, pre-financial crisis foray into U.S. consumer finance, and a $1.9 billion settlement over inadequate anti- money-laundering controls, HSBC renewed its focus on Asia and fast-growing parts of China.
Earlier this month, Mr. Flint took analysts on a tour of some of the bank's businesses in China, and has indicated the country will remain a key plank of growth plans.

HSBC,Tapestry Could Bag More Gains," Apr 23, 2018",1,"TAPESTRY, THE PARENT OF LUXURY-GOODS maker Coach, has stitched together a strong recovery, with plenty of room for more growth.
Shares of the handbag maker formerly known as Coach (ticker: TPR) are up 31%, to $53, since we recommended them late last year (""By Any Name, Coach Shares Look Like a Buy,"" Oct. 21). The stock could rise another 20% as the company continues to expand its family of brands internationally and realize operating efficiencies.
The flagship Coach brand keeps getting stronger. Coach saw improvement in the latest quarter in ""every productivity metric, including traffic, ticket, and conversion,"" writes Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Bill Dreher. That's due in part to smart design and a partnership with singer and actress Selena Gomez that's resonating well with younger consumers.
The big test for New York-based Tapestry is whether it will be able to translate Coach's success into a broader suite of businesses. Early indications are positive. Tapestry scooped up Kate Spade last summer after the company got itself in trouble with too many big sales. Management of the combined company has already seen success in reducing promotions. Kate has a new creative director, and its efforts to promote customization of items are showing momentum.
Operationally, Tapestry CEO Victor Luis believes that Kate's margins can eventually reach those of the moreefficient Coach brand. The company still expects to achieve $100 million to $115 million in annual synergies in the fiscal year ending in June 2019. Analysts predict that Tapestry will grow revenue 31%, to $5.9 billion, in the current fiscal year, and 4% in fiscal 2019. They model a 20% increase in this year's earnings per share, to $2.59, and a 12% increase next year.
Prior to its acquisition, Kate Spade didn't book sales in China because of a joint-venture arrangement. Tapestry has since taken control of that JV. The move is an ""important first step in building Kate in the Tapestry playbook in China,"" wrote Bernstein analyst Jamie Merriman, who rates the stock Outperform.
Kate is underexposed in China and could benefit from boosting its presence there, given that China's handbag market is estimated to be $25 billion, versus $29 billion for the U.S. market. Coach has about 200 stores in China, but Kate has only about 35. Tapestry is also in the midst of buying back the northern China business of Stuart Weitzman, another recent acquisition. The footwear company has only about 20 stores in China.
With both acquisitions going smoothly, Tapestry might have the capital to buy another major brand soon, writes HSBC analyst Erwan Rambourg. He thinks the shares could hit $63 in the next year, for a gain of nearly 20%. It's worth toting the stock as Tapestry mulls its next move.

HSBC,Senators Ask Banks for Information on Accounts Linked to Putin Allies; Two senior Democrats seek details on assets of 96 Russian oligarchs designated for possible sanctions," Apr 25, 2018",1,"WASHINGTON--Two senior Senate Democrats have asked a number of large banks to turn over information about accounts and assets controlled by a group of Russian elites who have been designated by the U.S. Treasury Department for possible sanctions.
In a letter to eight banks, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D, N.H.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D, R.I.) asked the financial entities for details about accounts, assets or services the institutions were providing to any of the 96 Russian oligarchs identified by the Treasury Department in January as having ties to the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 1174 of 1177
The letter was sent last week but reviewed by The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. The two Democrats said they had received acknowledgment of their letter from three banks, which are reviewing it.
Three of the banks--Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase &Co. and Citigroup Inc.--are U.S.-based. The other five--Barclays PLC, Deutsche Bank AG, UBS Group AG, HSBC Holdings PLC ADR and Credit Suisse Group AG--are headquartered abroad but in many cases have a significant presence in the U.S.
A spokesman for JPMorgan said the bank had received the letter and is reviewing it. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The other banks didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday night.
The oligarchs in question were named in a report compiled by the Trump administration in January. That list included 114 Russian political figures and 96 oligarchs with ties to the Putin government, who were defined in the report as individuals with an estimated net worth of $1 billion or more.
The list was mandated by Congress as part of a sanctions law overwhelmingly passed by Congress last year in retaliation for what intelligence agencies said was a Russian-backed campaign of meddling during the last U.S. presidential election. Russia has denied interfering in the election.
The oligarchs list was intended as a guidepost to inform possible U.S. sanctions, though inclusion on the list didn't necessarily mean that the individual would be ultimately sanctioned by the U.S. However, the report is likely to complicate financial and business relationships for those listed.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration sanctioned three-dozen Russian individuals and entities who were included on the oligarchs list in response to election meddling.
In their letter, the two Senate Democrats said they were seeking additional information about how the U.S. and international financial systems might be exploited by individuals on the sanction list and said that banks should use the list to identify possible money-laundering activities.
The oligarchs list ""should guide banks and help to detect and deter the exploitation of our financial system by Russian oligarchs and senior political figures, some of whom may have engaged in acts of corruption and the privatization of state-owned assets in a way which unjustly benefited state officials or their family members,"" Ms. Shaheen and Mr. Whitehouse wrote.
""Given their wealth and relationship to the Russian state, many oligarchs in Russia either wield or are susceptible to considerable political influence. These individuals often have global financial dealings, including in the U.S., through luxury real estate, personal property, or other interests and may utilize the U.S. financial system to conduct some of their activities,"" the two Democrats wrote.
The letter is a voluntary request for information and the banks are under no obligation to answer or turn over the information. But, according to people familiar with the matter, the two senators are prepared to ask the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog organization controlled by Congress that has investigative powers, to conduct a probe if the request is refused.
Mr. Putin said in January the creation and publication of the list was ""an unfriendly act,"" but that Russia didn't intend to ""pick a fight.""
