Ctit Group,"Citigroup Says Loan, Kushner Talk Unrelated"," Mar 22, 2018",0,"Citigroup Inc. said in a letter sent Tuesday to lawmakers that a loan made to Kushner Cos. shortly after the bank's chief executive met with Jared Kushner last year was ""completely appropriate.""

Kushner Cos. also disclosed Wednesday that it had recently received a separate $200 million loan from the bank.

The bank has faced questions about its dealings with Kushner Cos. following a White House meeting between its chief executive and Mr. Kushner.

On March 3, 2017, Citi Chief Executive Michael Corbat met with Mr. Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law and a senior adviser to the president. On March 31 of that year, Kushner Cos., which is controlled by members of Mr. Kushner's family, and two partner firms closed on a $325 million mortgage for a Brooklyn property with Citigroup, according to the bank.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and other lawmakers requested more information about the meeting from the bank after it was reported on by the New York Times last month.

Responding to that request, Citigroup's letter said ""the Kushner family has been a client of Citi for decades."" It added the bank started exploring the March loan in late 2016 before Mr. Corbat and Mr. Kushner met.

Mr. Corbat ""was unaware of the transaction"" until the article was published, and the loan didn't require his approval, the bank said.

""This transaction was done in the normal course of Citi's commercial real estate lending business, received the necessary credit and risk approvals without input from Mr. Corbat,and was unrelated to any discussions with Mr. Kushner,"" the bank wrote.

Mr. Corbat requested the meeting with Mr. Kushner with the purpose of discussing U.S. trade policy and the North American Free Trade Agreement, the bank said."

Ctit Group,Business News: BofA Curbs Loan Type After Steinhoff Loss," Mar 21, 2018",1,"Bank of America Corp. has wrapped up its internal review of its $292 million loss involving troubled South African firm Steinhoff International Holdings NV and dialed back its appetite for the type of stock-based loan that caused the loss, people familiar with the matter said.

Bank of America was one of a number of global lenders that held pieces of a 1.6 billion euro ($2 billion) loan to Christo Wiese, then chairman of the South African retailer. Mr. Wiese's shares in the company served as collateral for the financing. Those shares collapsed in value last fall after the retailer, which owns Mattress Firm and the Sleepy's brand, disclosed accounting irregularities.

The bank said in a statement Tuesday that its review of the loss is finished. It said the responsible thing to do with such a loss is to ""review it carefully, see if we missed something, and apply any lessons for the future,"" adding that the ""core cause"" of the loss was due to the behavior of another party.

The review has led the bank to dial back its appetite for collateralized loans to individuals that are backed solely by a borrower's holdings of a single stock. These loans leave a bank with few good options if the stock price collapses.

The collapse in the Steinhoff share price hit Mr. Wiese's lenders hard. In addition to Bank of America, Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group disclosed losses to what was typically described as a single-name client in the fourth quarter.

The company involved, people familiar with the matter said, was Steinhoff."
Ctit Group,Big Winners in Bill to Help Small Banks," Mar 15, 2018",1,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

Three of the biggest winners, in a bill meant to help small and midsize banks, are anything but.

The bill, championed by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, would raise the threshold for stricter oversight by the Federal Reserve to $250 billion in assets from $50 billion, a boon for midsize regional lenders. It also contains measures to reduce the burden of regulation on smaller community banks.

Thanks to this focus, it garnered enough Democratic support to pass in the Senate, despite strong opposition from the likes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who calls it a gift to Wall Street.

Another group of banks that dwarf these small lenders stands to get a healthy profit boost if the bill goes through: Bank of New York Mellon, with $372 billion of assets on its balance sheet; State Street, with $238 billion; and Northern Trust Corp., at $139 billion. These banks are more important than they might seem because they manage or have under custody trillions of dollars of assets.

These custody banks specialize in safekeeping the securities of institutional investors like mutual funds. Under the bill, they would be able to exclude some deposits they hold at the Federal Reserve or other central banks from their total assets when calculating total leverage. No other banks, big or small, get such a benefit.

The argument is that assets held at the Fed are free of risk, so banks shouldn't have to hold capital against them. The custody banks hold a disproportionate share of Fed deposits.

The impact could be quite significant. Keefe, Bruyette and Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl estimates the change could boost earnings per share at the two biggest custody banks by around 8%, assuming they use the freed-up capital to invest in other profit-generating assets.

JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, which have their own custody businesses, aren't granted the same exemption. This exclusion appears to be due to them still having negative reputations on Capitol Hill. Helping them out would jeopardize the bill's chance of passage.

Still, it makes no sense that central-bank deposits, if they are truly risk-free, be treated differently for different banks. The U.S. Treasury's report on financial regulation last year proposed that all banks be able to exclude Fed deposits from their leverage ratios. It also is jarring that such big custody banks will benefit from a bill designed to help smaller banks.

The fact that Congress narrowed the exemption to three banks that happen not to be household names says something about the current political climate. Even with Donald Trump in the White House and Republicans controlling Congress, politicians don't want to appear to be doing anything to help the most well-known Wall Street banks."
Ctit Group,Goldman Anoints Heir to Blankfein," Mar 13, 2018",1,"David Solomon became the heir apparent at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Monday after his main rival for the top job abruptly resigned, moves that show the Wall Street powerhouse is continuing to move beyond its trading roots.

The surprise announcement came after Goldman's board of directors last month anointed Mr. Solomon as the eventual successor to current Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, over co-President Harvey Schwartz, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Mr. Blankfein could retire as soon as year-end, though he remains firmly in control of his exit. Messrs. Schwartz, 54, and Solomon, 56, who were jointly elevated to the No. 2 role in December 2016, were the top contenders to succeed him.

The two hail from different parts of the firm. Mr. Solomon is a longtime investment banker who DJs on the side. Mr. Schwartz, a karate black belt, scaled the ranks of Goldman's trading arm on his way to becoming chief financial officer.

In choosing Mr. Solomon, Goldman is going with a business builder who is respected, if not universally loved, inside the firm. The move amounts to a bet that the coming decade will look little like the last one, as Goldman continues to evolve from a secretive trading powerhouse into a more entrepreneurial place.

The two men were told of the board's decision last week, at which point Mr. Schwartz, who was informed upon his return from a West Coast trip, said he would leave, people familiar with the matter said.

Mr. Blankfein shared the news Monday morning with the firm's management committee, a group of about 35 top officials. ""Harvey's leaving the firm,"" the typically blunt CEO said, according to people briefed on the meeting. Mr. Solomon quickly canceled a planned trip to China.

For generations, power at Goldman has swung between bankers and traders. When Mr. Blankfein, a former trading chief, took over in 2006, that business was dominant. Since the financial crisis, though, it has faltered, sending Goldman into new businesses like consumer banking and low-fee index funds in search of growth.

Those changes were seen to favor Mr. Solomon. He is known less as a superstar deal maker than a strong manager, able to prune dead weight, motivate strivers and marshal Goldman's resources behind big initiatives.

""David is a pied piper, and I mean that in the best way,"" said Chris Nassetta, CEO of Hilton Hotels Corp., who worked with Mr. Solomon at Bear Stearns. ""People want to follow him.""

Mr. Solomon came to Wall Street in the mid-1980s, selling commercial paper at Drexel Burnham Lambert. Off duty, he played social planner to a group of college friends, organizing casino outings in Atlantic City and summer rentals in the Hamptons, where roommates would wake up to find him mowing the lawn.

After a stint at Bear Stearns, Mr. Solomon joined Goldman as a rare outside partner in 1999 and set out to build a junk-debt business. In 2006 he assumed responsibility for Goldman's investment bankers, who advise companies on mergers and fundraisings.

Mr. Solomon is credited with professionalizing that division, which he ran for a decade. He had a policy of giving zero bonuses to the bottom 5% of employees, executives said. But he also spearheaded Goldman's efforts to lighten the workload for junior bankers, and took a leading role in the firm's effort to recruit and promote women. He built a debt capital-markets business that reported record revenues last year.

Mr. Schwartz, meanwhile, embodied Goldman's profitable past, having scaled the ranks of its trading division. As finance chief from 2013 to 2016, Mr. Schwartz navigated the political and market forces that reshaped banking after the crisis, and was a strong hand in the areas of risk management and regulation.

He graduated from high school in New Jersey and didn't bother applying to college, instead joining a local gym as an athletic trainer. He eventually attended Rutgers University, working as nightclub bouncer and other odd jobs to pay his way, and joined Citigroup Inc. as an operations temp in 1989.

He came to Goldman's commodities trading arm in 1997 as a derivatives salesman, helping energy and mining companies protect themselves from price swings.

By 2008, Mr. Schwartz was running the trading division. As the financial crisis unfolded, he kept the firm on the offensive while competitors pulled back. The gambit worked: Goldman's traders made $33 billion in 2009, the most profitable year on record for a Wall Street broker-dealer.

Mr. Schwartz was named CFO four years later, a move so unexpected that senior executives including the firm's heads of risk and accounting threatened to quit, according to a person familiar with the matter.

But Mr. Schwartz won over critics by overseeing an operation that avoided surprises that plagued other banks. His 18-quarter tenure as CFO is captured in pen on a pair of lime-green boxing gloves that he keeps in his office, a gift from Goldman's finance team: ""18-0, all by KO.""

As co-president, he helped shepherd the firm's consumer-lending initiative, Marcus, to its 2016 launch.

""It's been an incredible 21 years,"" he said in his final management committee meeting Monday, according to attendees. ""I've gotten more out of the firm than I put in. It's been an honor."""
Ctit Group,AmEx Needs More Fresh Thinking From Its New CEO," Mar 10, 2018",1,"American Express has a new leader, but its strategy and message haven't changed much. That may not cut it in a highly competitive and rapidly changing payments landscape.

New Chief Executive Stephen Squeri stuck to some familiar themes in his presentation during the company's annual investor day on Wednesday. He stressed the importance of the company's integrated, ""end-to-end"" business model, which includes customer cards, a global payments network and merchant services. He also touted the brand's reputation for security and customer service.

Over the course of the day, AmEx largely reiterated existing financial targets for 2018. It did, however, downgrade the amount it expects to earn in merchant fees per transaction.

On the consumer side, AmEx appears to have weathered a competitive assault from big bank rivals like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup surprisingly well. The relaunch of its flagship Platinum card last year was well-received. The company says it finished 2017 with a record number of Platinum customers who had also spent record amounts. It also renewed co-brand partnerships with Hilton Worldwide Holdings and Marriott International.

There remain reasons for concern, though. AmEx's rewards costs have been rising, but they remain low even compared with lower-end competitors. According to Credit Suisse Group, AmEx's rewards cost per dollar spent on its cards came to just 0.81% in 2017, compared with 1.1% for Capital One Financial and 1.24% for Discover Financial Services. This suggests pressure to keep enhancing rewards.

The company says its strong brand and the ""experiential value"" of its cards outweigh ""commoditized"" rewards like cash back and points. But, over the long run, money tends to talk loudest.

Second, the costs of the company's drive to expand lending to cardholders are coming into clearer view. Total provisions for credit losses rose 36% in 2017, and the company said it expects similar growth this year. Credit Suisse analyst Moshe Orenbuch notes this would put provision expenses at nearly half of pretax income this year, compared with just 25% in 2016.

The company stresses that the U.S. consumer business accounts for less than a third of its total business. But the competitive pressures in the U.S. consumer market aren't going away soon.

Leaning on its traditionally strong brand reputation isn't enough."
Ctit Group,Snap Can't Snip Its Way To Success," Mar 9, 2018",0,"Snap is a bit too young to be worried about dieting.

The parent company of Snapchat is planning to trim about 10% of the engineers in its employ, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday. An internal memo from the company obtained by the news site Cheddar put the total number of layoffs at 120.

Snap reported 3,069 full-time employees at the end of 2017, which was a gain of 65% from the previous year. But its pace of expansion slowed remarkably late in the year.

Minding the expense line typically isn't a bad idea for a company that, even with several favorable adjustments, lost more than $720 million last year. But investors aren't expecting Snap to cut its way into profitability.

Snap's fourth-quarter results last month were a good sign for the long term as user growth accelerated following a prolonged slowdown.

But the company also has shed nearly $3.7 billion in market value since those results after a recent redesign of Snapchat proved controversial.

Mark May of Citigroup cited a ""significant jump in negative app reviews"" when he downgraded the stock to a ""sell"" rating on Feb. 20. Snap shares lost 6% two days later after Kylie Jenner, one of the famed Kardashian clan, tweeted a criticism of the new design.

One celebrity, of course, isn't going to make or break the service. But the fact that Snap is still vulnerable to such whims indicates that those still employed by the company have a big job ahead."
Ctit Group,Blue Chips Fall as Cohn Exit Adds to Trade Concerns," Mar 8, 2018",0,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell after economic adviser Gary Cohn's resignation from the White House led to renewed concerns over a possible trade war and its impact on global growth.

Some investors saw Mr. Cohn's resignation as a sign that President Donald Trump was pushing forward with the steel and aluminum tariffs he promised last week and were worried that protectionist trade policies could spread. Mr. Trump will sign a proclamation to enact the tariffs this week, with ""potential carve-outs"" for Mexico, Canada and possibly other countries, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday.

Global trade disruptions could lead to ripple effects for a wide range of commodities and products, some investors fear, resulting in higher costs for companies and consumers and slower economic growth. The concerns about trade come after worries about higher interest rates sent the blue chips in February to their worst month in two years.

""We do think the aggregate risk to this more placid narrative has really gone up in recent months,"" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""Things like trade policy changes and the potential for a trade war -- those are real issues that may alter the timeline of economic growth and stability.""

The Dow industrials closed down 82.76 points, or 0.3%, at 24801.36, after earlier shedding as much as 349 points. The S&P 500 edged down 1.32 points, or less than 0.1%, to 2726.80, while the Nasdaq Composite added 24.64 points, or 0.3%, to 7396.65.

Stocks rose to start the week after prominent members of the Republican Party pushed back against the tariffs, fueling bets that a widespread trade war was unlikely.

A number of companies and other countries have also voiced concerns about the tariffs in recent days, with full details yet to be announced and uncertainty surrounding negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement. The European Union on Wednesday urged Mr. Trump to rethink his planned tariffs, threatening to strike back unless he reverses course.

""You will have a disruption in growth if you get to the point where everybody is saying, 'We have no other option but to hit back,'"" said Dec Mullarkey, a managing director on the investment research team at Sun Life Investment Management.

Industrial firms that would be hurt most by higher commodities costs were among Wednesday's worst performers. Heavy-machinery maker Caterpillar fell $2.24, or 1.5%, to $151.51, weighing on the Dow.

Some U.S. bank stocks also fell as markets fretted over Mr. Cohn's departure and its implications for trade, the economy and regulation. JPMorgan Chase fell 43 cents, or 0.4%, to 114.73, while Citigroup slipped 14 cents, or 0.2%, to 73.92.

Oil prices fell 2.3%, leading to declines in the energy sector after government data showed crude stockpiles rose and U.S. production reached new heights last week. Those losses helped offset gains in the technology, health-care and real-estate sectors.

Some investors said they expect the market to recover and the global economy to remain strong, as long as an all-out trade war is avoided.

""In general, it should be a good period [for markets], but it's probably going to ping pong between these bouts of low volatility and great asset performance and short, sharp corrections that push people back on their heels when something crops up on the trade front"" or elsewhere, said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income.

Asian stocks were higher early Thursday. At midday in Tokyo, Japan's Nikkei was up 0.75% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 1.3%."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: BNY's New Chief Pushes Overhaul," Mar 8, 2018",0,"As Charles Scharf settled into his first weekly sales meeting at Bank of New York Mellon Corp. last summer, the newly named chief executive thought there were far too many of his colleagues there.

Within weeks, the meetings were revamped; fewer employees were invited and those that did were expected to participate. ""It's true of everything,"" Mr. Scharf told The Wall Street Journal. ""Meetings should have as few people as possible, but all the right people.""

It is a familiar tenet to those who worked alongside Mr. Scharf at Citigroup Inc. and later JPMorgan Chase & Co., where he served for years as a top lieutenant to CEO James Dimon. Both Mr. Dimon and Citigroup's Sandy Weill leaned on a small cadre of deputies to overhaul businesses, with people that could often ""finish each other's sentences"" in rooting out bureaucracy, one former colleague said.

Mr. Scharf, who joined BNY Mellon in July, is turning to pages of the same playbook as part of a broader overhaul. He already has laid off staff, consolidated office space and overhauled executive pay. His challenge is to kick-start the bank that has been mired by slow growth and price wars that have weighed on profit.

BNY Mellon completes some of Wall Street's most vital, if boring, tasks: connecting many of the world's sellers to buyers, tracking the value of securities and safeguarding trillions of dollars in assets. Yet many of those businesses still rely heavily on legions of operations employees.

Alexander Hamilton, who founded the Bank of New York more than two centuries ago, ""left for the duel and told the bank not to change anything until he got back, and they haven't,"" one former competitor said, recounting an old joke about the custody bank.

At an investor meeting Thursday, Mr. Scharf will outline his plans for change, and details on additional cost cuts are likely.

Of BNY Mellon's 53,000 employees, some 20,000 work in operations. As the bank moves to automate processes, in time ""that number should be a fraction of what it is,"" Mr. Scharf said.

BNY Mellon aims to ride one of the biggest changes to affect the financial world in decades: the digitization of nearly every step that money takes as it flows through the global economy.

Mr. Scharf is spending heavily in technology in an effort to better harness the reams of data produced by the assets they oversee. In January, he told investors that he would plow all of this year's benefits from the new U.S. tax rules, some $250 million, into investments in technology and employees.

And then there is the dress code. It is common for Mr. Scharf to arrive at work wearing black jeans.

Mr. Scharf is eager to pick up the pace. He also has been careful not to move too quickly, sounding out some of his new colleagues on how to avoid alienating employees, people familiar with the matter said.

""Every organization can move at a different speed,"" Mr. Scharf said."
Ctit Group,Big Bank Custody Fight," Mar 8, 2018",1,"The Senate is debating a bill that would relax Dodd-Frank's chokehold on small banks, but a couple of provisions that ease capital and liquidity standards for the giants will make the financial system more vulnerable in a panic.

Tucked into Banking Chairman Mike Crapo's legislation is a directive to federal agencies to amend the ""supplementary leverage ratio"" for custodial banks by excluding deposits at a central bank. Custodial banks secure assets for clients such as large institutional investors and fund managers.

At first glance, this provision would appear to apply only to Boston-based State Street, Chicago's Northern Trust and Bank of New York Mellon. But Citigroup and J.P. Morgan also offer custodial services and are trying to join the party. You can bet others will want in too. ""As Congress has sought to make a common sense change to the way capital rules treat custody assets, we have asked that they apply that change to all custody banks to maintain a level playing field in this important business,"" a Citi spokesman said last week.

As we saw during the crisis, financial regulators are poor judges of risk. Banks had piled into investments that regulators deemed low risk such as mortgage-backed securities and sovereign debt that let them meet capital standards even while remaining highly leveraged. You know how that worked out.

So the Federal Reserve and other regulators in 2014 adopted a simple, non-risk weighted measure of equity to total assets called the supplemental leverage ratio -- 5% for global giants. Banks get no more credit for investing in Treasurys than in corporate debt. This leverage limit prevents banks from gaming capital rules and herding into putatively ""low-risk"" assets, which overall reduces systemic risk.

The big guys gripe that the Fed's capital standards are excessive. But if banks want to lend more, they can build equity. Last year Citi and J.P. Morgan each announced plans to return some $19 billion to shareholders. Big banks were undercapitalized prior to the panic and experienced losses on average equal to 6% of assets. Most have built up about that much now, though State Street, Bank of New York Mellon, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have less.

An exemption for central bank deposits would improve the leverage ratio on paper for many big banks to between 7% and 8%. So custody banks could stash their customer funds at the Fed or another central bank where they'd earn modest interest. The risk is that they will then use this dispensation to increase debt or reduce capital.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates a ""50 percent chance"" that regulators would extend the regulatory exemption to J.P. Morgan and Citi, which is probably low. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week at a Congressional hearing that ""the leverage ratio can deter banks"" from ""engaging in low-risk wholesale activities, particularly the custody banks,"" adding that ""I think we got the calibration a little bit wrong so our plan is to roll it back."" His preference would be to do so for all big banks.

The economy could use more risk-taking, and some small businesses have had trouble getting credit under the new Dodd-Frank regime. But the Senate bill would remedy this problem by reducing administrative burdens on regional and community banks where regulatory compliance has gratuitously diverted resources from customer services. Regional and community banks have on average a leverage ratio of 8.7%.

If central bank deposits are exempted from the leverage ratio, why not Treasurys or municipal debt? Speaking of which, big banks are also pleading for more latitude under the Fed's liquidity rules. The Senate bill obliges by directing the Fed to classify investment-grade municipal debt as ""high quality liquid assets.""

Banks love muni debt because of its tax exemption and supposed security, though bankruptcies in Puerto Rico, Detroit and Stockton, Calif., betrayed this conceit. Muni bonds are not actively traded in the secondary market, and prices are opaque. The 1975 Tower amendment also exempts municipal securities from mandatory investor disclosures.

Government finances can quickly deteriorate. Recall the Orange County bankruptcy in 1994 that resulted from bad bond bets amid rising interest rates. During a market meltdown, banks would find it hard to unload munis. One lesson from the last crisis was that even supposedly liquid, high-grade assets can become illiquid when investors panic, markets lock up and prices fall.

The Senate bill would encourage banks to pile into munis and make it cheaper for states and cities to borrow -- thus encouraging more government leverage. Governments and financial investors are often co-dependent, but Senators ought to resist enabling both."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Fintech Cyber Risk Draws Attention," Mar 7, 2018",1,"WASHINGTON -- Four financial companies, including Citigroup Inc. and online lender Kabbage Inc., said they have formed a consortium to address the cybersecurity risks of financial-technology firms, a sign of the industry's growing links to traditional banks and insurers.

The consortium, which was created in response to recommendations in a World Economic Forum report released Tuesday, also includes Zurich Insurance Group AG and Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., a U.S. clearinghouse.

""There are a lot of these fintechs popping up left and right,"" said Matthew Blake, head of the financial and monetary system initiative at the World Economic Forum. ""The financial system is becoming much more modular,"" he added, noting that the ""one-stop shop"" model of banking is being challenged by new types of financial services firms.

The group's first objective will be to establish criteria to enable fintech companies to evaluate the level of their cybersecurity defenses. The World Economic Forum report called for the creation of such criteria as well as a common metric to measure fintech firms' cybersecurity exposure. Those steps would allow traditional financial institutions to better evaluate the level of risk they are exposing themselves to when partnering with fintech firms, Mr. Blake suggested.

""Technologists are not incentivized to focus on cybersecurity upfront in the design phase,"" said Mr. Blake. ""Really innovative companies [have] some cybersecurity preparedness but not to the level of what an incumbent company would offer,"" he said.

The recommendations, based on input from bank leaders and other financial executives, lays out more than a dozen additional steps financial companies should take to evaluate and improve fintech firms' cybersecurity defenses."
Ctit Group,Big Banks Score a Win on Munis," Mar 7, 2018",1,"WASHINGTON -- Bipartisan legislation expected to clear the Senate as early as this week has just one provision that is set to directly benefit the nation's megabanks: a section aimed at making it easier for them to buy state and local bonds.

The provision, championed by Citigroup Inc. and other large banks, would ease a new rule aimed at ensuring banks can raise enough cash during a financial-market meltdown to fund their operations for 30 days, requiring them to hold more cash or securities that are easily salable.

Under federal banking rules approved in 2014, those ""high quality liquid assets"" included cash, Treasury bonds and corporate debt but not municipal debt. Banks like to hold municipal bonds because of their safety and tax advantages.

The Senate on Tuesday voted, 67-32, to formally begin debate on the bill, which primarily benefits small and medium-size banks, easily reaching the 60 votes needed and signaling that the measure has enough support from Democrats to pass by a comfortable margin. The legislation was backed by 16 Democrats and one independent, Maine Sen. Angus King, bucking Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and 31 other Democrats who opposed the procedural vote.

Including the municipal-bond provision in the deregulatory bill was a priority for the nation's biggest banks that buy a lot of municipal securities as investments. A Citigroup lobbyist recently told a Senate staffer that the firm would be pleased if easing the treatment of municipal debt under the bank-funding rule was the one thing it could accomplish during the current Congress, said a person familiar with the conversation.

State and local officials have praised the move, saying their securities could suffer if banks begin to shun them.

A Citigroup spokesman said the bond provision ""is supported by a wide array of groups focused on helping cities and states address critical infrastructure needs.""

While the provision is a victory for Citigroup, the biggest U.S. banks haven't lobbied extensively on the Senate bill, congressional aides said. Big firms have spent billions of dollars to comply with postcrisis rules and generally aren't eager to tear them down.

Analysts have said changing the rule for municipal products would be a mistake because it would erode the core of a bank-safety rule put in place after the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. While municipal securities have relatively low default rates, they are traded thinly and shouldn't count as liquid assets, critics say.

""It's an outrageously bad idea,"" said Phillip Swagel, a professor at the University of Maryland who served in the George W. Bush Treasury, characterizing the provision as an implicit federal guarantee of the municipal market. In the next crisis, banks will have trouble selling their municipal securities, freezing up the market for them and requiring the government to step in to backstop it, he predicted.

While lawmakers agreed to include the municipal-debt measure, they rebuffed Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase & Co. efforts to water down a separate postcrisis capital requirement known as the supplementary leverage ratio.

That regulation effectively restricts banks from making too many loans without adding new capital, forcing firms to maintain a proportion of capital to fund their assets.

The legislation includes a provision to diminish the leverage ratio in a way that lawmakers say would only benefit financial institutions primarily engaged in ""custody services,"" in which they hold assets on behalf of other banks. Citigroup and JPMorgan, global banks that don't fit the definition but still offer custody services, have argued it is unfair to carve out certain banks from the provision and not others.

""As Congress has sought to make a common sense change to the way capital rules treat custody assets, we have asked that they apply that change to all custody banks to maintain a level playing field in this important business,"" a Citigroup spokesman said.

Senate aides said lawmakers crafted a delicate compromise that can pass the chamber and don't want to broaden the bill with more provisions helping big banks and risk having the bill fail.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has said that the Fed would prefer that Congress allow regulators to rewrite the leverage ratio rule. Instead, the bill directs regulators to exclude certain assets from the calculation of the leverage ratio for custody banks.

Lenders Could Get

Help From Senate

The Senate is voting on a bill as early as this week that would make the largest changes to financial regulatory law since 2010, when the Dodd-Frank Act passed. Supporters say it will help small lenders without undoing Dodd-Frank's core tenets. Opponents say the bill cuts protections against consumer abuses and financial crises. Here's what's in Senate Bill 2155.

Help for Regional Banks

-- Dodd-Frank said larger banks must follow stricter rules than smaller ones. It drew the line at $50 billion in assets, leaving about 40 of the roughly 5,670 U.S. banks above it. The bill would effectively raise that threshold to $250 billion in assets, leaving 12 banks facing mandatory annual ""stress tests"" and other hurdles.

Help for Big Banks

-- The bill would make it easier for big banks to buy bonds from state and local governments.

-- It would lower a capital requirement called the leverage ratio for State Street Corp. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp., two large ""custody"" banks that predominantly hold clients' assets for safekeeping, rather than lending out client money like traditional banks. Some observers say other big banks in the custody business, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., may end up qualifying for this help.

Help for Small Lenders

-- Small banks would be exempt from the Volcker rule, which bans banks from making speculative bets.

-- Small banks would file shorter financial reports with regulators, be examined less often and be released from some capital rules as long as they maintain a relatively high ratio of equity to assets."
Ctit Group,Warren Democrats for Wall Street," Mar 6, 2018",0,"The Senate this week will debate a bipartisan bill that would relax some of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law's blunderbuss regulations. Progressives are denouncing the modest reforms as gifts to Wall Street, though the irony is that Dodd-Frank has been a boon for the biggest banks.

Like ObamaCare, Dodd-Frank was a product of the Pelosi Congress and faith in the genius of central planners. The law enshrined too-big-to-fail while writing vague language that has led to hundreds of new rules, some measuring thousands of pages, that are the bane of small lenders and their customers.

Ms. Warren and Ohio's Sherrod Brown are leading opposition to Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo's bill that has 12 Democratic co-sponsors. ""The bank lobbyists are getting ready to pop champagne and light their cigars,"" Ms. Warren says. Bankers wish they partied as much as Ms. Warren says they do, but her claims bear little relation to the actual bill.

Mainly, the Crapo bill eases administrative burdens on 5,000 some community banks that make up about 98% of financial institutions but only 15% of assets. Small lenders would be exempt from Dodd-Frank's requirement to disclose loan demographic data by census track, income, race, age and gender.

Banks under $10 billion in assets would be exempt from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's qualified mortgage rule and its rigid underwriting standards and loan design. Progressives say the exemption could lead to another housing bubble. But only about 3% of single-family loans held by community banks were seriously delinquent during the first quarter of 2011 compared with more than 16% at banks with more than $1 trillion in assets, according to the American Enterprise Institute's Ed Pinto.

As ever, the real danger lies at the taxpayer-backed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which securitize mortgages. The government-sponsored enterprises are exempt from key provisions of the CFPB rule and other underwriting standards under Dodd-Frank. The Crapo bill does nothing to reduce their taxpayer safety net, which is a shame.

The Warren left is most exercised by an increase in the bank asset threshold for ""enhanced prudential standards"" to $250 billion from $50 billion. This would liberate a couple dozen regional banks from too-big-to-fail rules designed to prevent failures among large systemically important financial institutions.

The standards are cumbersome, and compliance is costly. For instance, banks must establish ""procedures for monitoring intraday liquidity risk exposure."" This is like requiring all 50 states to develop earthquake-response plans when the risk is confined to a few. Mid-size outfits like Zions Bank of Salt Lake City didn't cause the 2008 financial panic. And even Barney Frank has said that applying the same liquidity and stress-testing requirements to banks with $50 billion in assets as those with more than $1 trillion was a ""mistake.""

Smaller banks are better capitalized than large institutions in large part because they don't benefit from a government safety net. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Vice Chairman Thomas Hoenig says regional banks have on average 200 basis points more in tangible equity than global giants.

While J.P. Morgan and Citigroup can afford to hire hundreds of compliance officers, Dodd-Frank's burdens handicap smaller competitors. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said last month at the Economic Club of Washington that ""Dodd-Frank is fine"" and ""none of us are trying to touch it,"" though he wants lower capital standards for his bank.

The Federal Reserve is currently recalibrating capital requirements, which if anything ought to be higher for the big banks that have only 6% of tangible equity -- far less than the 10% that Mr. Hoenig says could be needed to withstand another panic.

One problem in the Crapo bill is a provision that eases capital standards by an effective 20% to 25% for so-called custody banks by excluding their central bank deposits. These banks required as much as $90 billion a day in emergency lending to cover funding losses during the crisis, and Mr. Hoenig warns that this carve-out could cause the giants to demand the same treatment.

Perhaps the bill's biggest defects are that it doesn't touch too-big-to-fail or the CFPB's unconstitutional design. The House has passed a better reform, and some of those ideas could make it into a House-Senate conference. One idea is to make the CFPB a bipartisan commission, which should elate Democrats who say Mick Mulvaney has defanged the agency.

The dozen Democrats who have broken with the Warren wing need a political winner after voting against the GOP tax cuts. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also wants bank cash for his Senate candidates, which is why he's giving them a pass. Count it as progress that at least a few Democrats are beginning to dissent from Ms. Warren."
Ctit Group,"Business News: Albertsons Hires Retail Veteran --- Former CEO of Starbucks, Extended Stay to oversee merger with Rite Aid"," Mar 5, 2018",1,"Albertsons Cos. and Rite Aid Corp. are bringing on a retail veteran to steer the grocery and pharmacy chains through their complex, roughly $24 billion merger.

Executives of the new company Monday named Jim Donald their president and chief operating officer. The 64-year-old former Starbucks Corp. chief executive was most recently CEO of the Extended Stay America Inc. hotel chain and sits on the board of chocolate supplier Barry Callebaut.

Albertsons Chief Executive Bob Miller said in an interview that Mr. Donald's decades of experience at many different kinds of retailers will help him stitch together Albertsons's and Rite Aid's disparate businesses.

""The skills he's acquired by doing those things will be a plus,"" Mr. Miller said.

Mr. Donald's tenure at Starbucks was bumpy, and he was pushed out in 2008 over concerns the coffee chain had overexpanded. He didn't respond to a request for comment. Mr. Miller said many CEOs struggled to stabilize consumer companies after the recession.

Mr. Donald also held leadership roles at Walmart Inc., Albertsons and other regional grocery chains in the past, and served on Rite Aid's board.

Retailers are looking to deals outside their comfort zones to defend themselves on one front against giants like Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. and on another against fickle customers who have more choices for filing their grocery carts and prescriptions.

Less than half of shoppers in a recent survey said one supermarket is their primary source for consumer products, according to the Food Marketing Institute trade group, down from 67% in 2005.

Bankers expect midsize retailers in particular to pursue more mergers. Albertsons and Rite Aid are ranked third in their respective sectors. Retail mergers also are getting larger. U.S. retail deals last year averaged $447 million, the second highest in more than a decade, according to Dealogic.

A Citigroup report last month predicted the number of deals will be higher this year after new federal tax legislation handed companies more cash to potentially deploy. Activist shareholders also are pressuring companies to make big bets

Deals between companies in different sectors can pose greater challenges than a merger between close competitors. Executives can struggle to synchronize everything from supply chains to loyalty programs between two companies that may not completely overlap, said J. Neely, managing director, Accenture Strategy, global M&A lead.

""The path to value is much more complex,"" he said.

Some grocery analysts worry Albertsons and Rite Aid could emerge as a big company without a unique identity that would fail to appeal to shoppers and persuade shareholders to stay on board.

""My main concern would be that this is a deal that primarily is about size,"" said Kevin Coupe, a supermarket analyst who writes the MorningNewsBeat industry newsletter.

Moody's Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings, meanwhile, said the company could struggle to generate profit while working off a high debt load.

""Albertson's is buried in debt,"" said Rite Aid shareholder Jonathan Martin, who intends to vote against the merger, which the companies hope to conclude this summer. ""It's going completely backwards for Rite Aid shareholders.""

The combined company's debt is projected to be more than six times earnings before expenses, a high level, according to Moody's.

Mr. Miller said the company has enough cash and that based on the response he received on a recent investor roadshow, he believes shareholders will approve the deal.

Executives believe the combined company will benefit from selling shoppers everything from migraine medication to meal kits in one store. Customers who shop for groceries while picking up prescriptions spend more than three times more than supermarket shoppers who only buy groceries, according to figures that Albertsons executives presented recently to shareholders.

Albertsons aims to make another acquisition in the next year or so, people familiar with the matter said. They said Cerberus Capital Management LP, the private-equity firm that owns a majority of Albertsons, won't sell its stake in the combined company soon and sees Rite Aid as a profit driver.

Cross-sector mergers also face less regulatory scrutiny than tie-ups between competitors, said Henry Su, a partner at Constantine Cannon in Washington D.C., and former staff attorney for the Federal Trade Commission. Both Albertsons and Rite Aid have faced regulatory pushback during past merger efforts with other partners."
Ctit Group,"Investing in Funds &amp;amp; ETFs: A Monthly Analysis --- Best Bet/Worst Bet: A House Was Better Than Her BofA Stock --- Sallie Krawcheck talks about a stock she cashed in, and one she should've skipped"," Mar 5, 2018",0,"Sallie Krawcheck has been a saver since she was a child. In third grade, she started putting away the 25 cents an hour her dad paid her to do filing in his office. Later, she graduated to babysitting and working in the family store. When she was a sophomore in high school, her parents -- ""solidly middle class"" -- borrowed money from her to replace their hot-water heater.

""By the way,"" she says, ""I charged them interest for repayment. Not in a mean way. But, hey, it's not in the bank, and it was the '70s, so you would really earn something in the bank -- inflation and all that. I was always the one who was most aware of and confident with money.""

After college, she became a fixture on Wall Street, with high-profile leadership roles at both Citigroup and Merrill Lynch. Now she's the chief executive and co-founder of Ellevest, a digital financial-investment firm for women.

For years, Ms. Krawcheck says she thought the idea of a woman-focused investment firm was a bad idea that would lead to ""remedial financial education."" But over time, she came to see that women are motivated differently from men, and that the industry is focused far more on the way men view investing.

""Women are not as energized by outperforming the market or picking the latest stock or getting that latest money manager and talking about it at cocktail parties as gentlemen are,"" she says. ""Women are more about, 'I want to reach my goals. What I'm really interested in is can I retire well, not whether I'm going to outperform when the euro is weak versus the yen.' ""

She says she'd like to think that co-founding Ellevest will prove to be the best investment she has ever made. But meanwhile, here's a look at what she says are the best and worst investments in her rearview mirror.

Best Bet: A house in the Hamptons

INVESTMENT: $9.5 million of cashed-out Citigroup stock

GAINS: Around $7.5 million in unrealized real-estate value

In 2004, when Ms. Krawcheck was Citigroup's chief financial officer, she wanted to buy a vacation home in the Hamptons, the famed stretch of exclusive beach communities along Long Island's south shore. She zeroed in on a house in Quogue. To make the purchase, she decided to cash out $9.5 million of her Citigroup stock. That was something of a faux pas in the C-suite.

""It was really frowned upon at Citigroup to sell stock as a senior leader,"" she says. ""We had an informal-that-was-sort-of-formal blood oath where you didn't sell stock.""

She did it anyway. She cashed out when Citi was around $40 a share. Today the stock is at the equivalent of about $7.50, after adjusting for a 1-for-10 reverse share split in 2011.

Meanwhile, the house in Quogue was recently appraised at $17 million.

THE TAKEAWAY: ""The real takeaway, of course, is diversity, diversity, diversity,"" she says. ""I diversified away from Citigroup stock and into real estate.""

Her portfolio at the time wasn't nearly as diversified as it should have been, she says. Citigroup was her biggest asset ""by a good measure."" Her financial adviser at the time said she could survive a hit to her Citi stock, but so much of her other assets were tied up in equities, too, leaving her far too exposed.

""Look,"" Ms. Krawcheck says, ""stocks are wonderful, bonds are fantastic, [but] a home is your heart,"" she says. ""I wanted that home for my children to have a place outside of the city to go every weekend and summers.""

Worst Bet: Bank of America

INVESTMENT: $1 million

LOSSES: About $500,000 and an incalculable amount of time, energy and lost wages

In 2009, Ms. Krawcheck was hired to lead Merrill Lynch Wealth Management eight months after the company was purchased by Bank of America. At the time, she says, she saw it as more than the opportunity to lead a storied financial institution. It was a chance to help dig the company, industry and country out of the financial crisis, ""and to really make some small part of history.""

To show that she was committed, she bought $1 million of Bank of America stock.

""If I was going to work at the company, I wanted to be all in,"" she says.

""I wanted to be financially committed to it. I wanted to be emotionally committed to it. I wanted to have the [Merrill Lynch] bull on the hat.""

Unfortunately, she says, ""they weren't as committed to me as I was to them.""

In 2011, Bank of America let her go as part of a reorganization. No longer with the company, she ditched the stock, which had fallen roughly 50%, from about $16 to near $8, and took a $500,000 loss.

THE TAKEAWAY: Ms. Krawcheck says the sourness of the investment was about more than the loss of the stock value. The purchase represented a career move that turned out not to be as rewarding as she expected.

Ms. Krawcheck says that when she looks back on the Bank of America purchase, like other investment milestones in her life, the gains and losses are never sorted out solely on paper.

""The investments are broader than just these monetary things,"" she says. ""The home is not just a portfolio holding, but a real home. Ellevest is not just a monetary investment, but a sort of life investment.

""So, for me,"" Ms. Krawcheck says, ""these things aren't as cut and dried as if I had bought IBM but forgot to sell it.""

Ctit Group,Blackstone CEO Reaps $800 Million Payday," Mar 2, 2018",0,"Blackstone Group LP Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman took home at least $800 million in 2017, one of the largest paydays ever at a publicly traded company and the latest affirmation of Wall Street's postcrisis rebound.

The haul, detailed Thursday in a regulatory filing, underscores the ascendancy of firms that manage private investment funds for institutions and the wealthy. Blackstone, which collects fees for managing clients' money and keeps a slice of investment gains, has benefited lately from robust markets for stocks, debt and real estate as well as banks' retreat from businesses such as specialty lending, into which Blackstone has expanded.

It's likely that Mr. Schwarzman, 71 years old, took home significantly more than the $800 million disclosed by the firm. Over the past five years, his position has yielded him more than $3.2 billion, largely in dividends and fund payouts. Mr. Schwarzman is known to remark that his salary, $350,000, is similar to the starting pay for the firm's greenest investment professionals.

The sums paid Mr. Schwarzman rank with some of the largest gains in corporate history. In 1987, junk-bond pioneer Michael Milken was paid more than $550 million raising debt that fueled the corporate takeovers on which the likes of KKR & Co. and Blackstone were built. Two decades later, hedge-fund manager John Paulson pocketed $5 billion when his fund's huge wager against the subprime mortgage market paid off during the foreclosure crisis.

Compensation for Wall Street chiefs and deal makers has been on the rise in recent years alongside major stock indexes. The heads of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley collectively received about $126 million, the highest annual tally since 2006, the year before financial markets melted down. On average, the banks' chief executive officers were paid $25.3 million apiece, up 17% from 2016, securities filings show.

Beyond Wall Street, Silicon Valley and the shale boom have showered company founders with huge paydays.

Facebook Inc. founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg had a $3.3 billion payday in 2013 from exercised stock options.

Stock awards paid out $1.1 billion to Richard D. Kinder, a co-founder of pipeline company Kinder Morgan Inc., in 2011.

For Blackstone and its rivals, such as KKR and Apollo Global Management LLC, the soaring stock market has enabled them to profitably sell shares of companies they own while rising real-estate prices have created an outlet to unload assets as well. The gains have enabled these firms' founders to consistently reap nine-figure annual paydays from dividends and investment profits.

Blackstone last year sold a big chunk of its Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. stock, pushing its profits on the 2007 hotel takeover to about $14 billion. Early in the year, it listed shares of its Invitation Homes Inc., the country's largest rental homeowner by number of houses.

KKR's founding cousins, Henry Kravis and George Roberts, each collected more than $170 million in 2017. Apollo's Leon Black took home $209 million last year, while co-founders Joshua Harris and Marc Rowan received $132 million and $101 million, respectively.

Pension managers and others have flocked to these firms' funds in hopes of bolstering returns weakened by years of historically low yields on other investments.

Investors committed $453 billion to private-equity funds and $107 billion to private debt funds in 2017, both records, according to data provider Preqin.

Mr. Schwarzman and a partner founded Blackstone in 1985 as a merger advisory business with $400,000 and a secretary. At the end of 2017, it managed $434.1 billion. For the first time, Blackstone did not disclose profits generated by the personal investments in its funds by him and other top executives. In past years, the firm has disclosed such payments, ranging from $11 million to $85 million.

Blackstone said in its filing that it paid its roughly 2,360 employees a median salary of $218,449.

Some are skeptical that the large paydays for top Wall Street executives are fully justified at a time of soft wage growth and concern over wealth inequality.

""Does that mean these individuals performed better? No, it just shows they were in the right place at the right time,"" said Rosanna Landis Weaver, who heads executive compensation research at shareholder advocacy firm As You Sow."
Ctit Group,Streetwise: Don't Count on Fed to See All," Mar 2, 2018",1,"Part of the grip central bankers have on markets comes from their mystique. The Federal Reserve holds sway over the price of money, which gives it hard power. But the Fed's soft power is almost as valuable: Its pronouncements on the future of the economy provide the baseline for investor forecasts, and not only because they are trying to work out what the Fed will do with interest rates.

The Fed's aura of invincibility has been dented over the past decade. Yet those listening to new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testify to Congress this week showed little willingness to question his foreknowledge about the economy.

He expressed confidence that the economy has strengthened this year, and traders took his words as a sign of a hawkish shift, pushing up the estimated chances for four rate increases this year higher than for two increases for the first time. (The median forecast of Fed policy makers is for three increases, still the most likely outcome priced into federal-funds futures.)

There are a few reasons to cast doubt on Mr. Powell's belief that the economy has strengthened this year. More broadly, investors should shrug off the idea that the Fed has any special insight into what will happen a year from now. Central-bank prognostications should be treated not as a guide to the economy, but merely as a guide to how officials might react to what happens.

A month ago, the market consensus had already shifted to a belief in synchronized global growth and a much stronger U.S. economy in the short run. But data since then have begun to disappoint, and while it is far too soon to dismiss the idea of faster growth, it doesn't seem to have arrived as quickly as was first thought.

The clearest sign comes from the Atlanta Fed's ""GDP Now."" Its econometricians use incoming data to build a live forecast of the current quarter's growth rate. Strong surveys pushed it to predict first-quarter growth of 5.4% at the start of February, but it is now predicting just 2.6%, dragged down in part by weaker housing and durable-goods orders.

The Atlanta Fed prediction will change as more data come in, but at the moment it is in line with the first estimate of fourth-quarter GDP, which was itself revised slightly lower to 2.5% this week.

We seem to be back in the familiar wait-and-see story of strong survey data not being followed through -- yet -- in actual economic decisions. Stronger growth will probably come, but it isn't obvious that there is much more reason to believe it today than at the start of the year.

Citigroup's economic-surprise index shows this clearly. What it classifies as ""soft"" data such as surveys have been coming in well above expectations, while ""hard"" data have been more mixed, with disappointing retail sales, housing and capital-goods orders offset by the strong jobs market.

Continued moderate growth isno reason for gloom. Neither, though, is it a reason to raise the estimated chances of four rate increases and push up Treasury yields. If we assume Mr. Powell has no special insight into where the economy is going, the question is whether his comments should lead us to think the Fed will be more hawkish under his leadership. The answer is no. He said nothing Tuesday to change what Fed watchers call the ""reaction function,"" how the Fed will respond to any given economic environment. He just said he thought the economic environment was stronger, and an unchanged reaction function would lead to tighter monetary policy if he turns out to be correct.

Mr. Powell's and the Fed's reaction functions matter a lot, but his view of the economy will be proved right or wrong long before the Fed has to decide on a fourth rate increase in the fourth quarter of the year.

Mr. Powell's assessment of the jobs market should further undermine the notion that the Fed has a crystal ball. He said both that the natural rate of unemployment was ""somewhere in the low 4s"" and that the median Fed policy-maker forecast of 4.6% ""sounds about right to me."" The explanation lies in uncertainty: ""it could be 5 and it could be 3 1/2,"" he told the House.

Investors seeking certainty are looking for the wrong thing, but it is refreshing to have it spelled out quite so clearly. The big question in the U.S. jobs market is whether there are lots of discouraged and part-time employees ready to rejoin the workforce as the economy strengthens, limiting wage pressures. The Fed's view: ""The only way to know is to, is to find out,"" Mr. Powell said.

Investors can't wait. Ifnext week's nonfarm-payrolls reportbrings a repeat of January's surprisingly strong wage figures, it would push up inflation expectations, lead to another bond selloff and probably hurt stocks again. On this, as so much else, investors need to form their own opinions, not rely on central bankers."
Ctit Group,"Goldman, Adviser to The Elite, Wants to Be the Local Bank --- Its Marcus brand targets consumer markets the Wall Street powerhouse once disdained"," Feb 28, 2018",1,"SALT LAKE CITY -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has come to Main Street.

In a glass-walled tower in Utah's capital, hundreds of Goldman employees are building what amounts to one of the world's most ambitious consumer-finance startups.

Their address, 111 Main St., stands as a symbol of the changes afoot inside the firm, better known as an elite adviser to big companies and billionaires. Struggling to make money in the postcrisis world, Goldman is pushing into businesses it once dismissed as pedestrian and gimmicky, assembling a suite of banking products for the middle class it hopes will power growth.

Goldman 18 months ago began making online loans of a few thousand dollars under the brand Marcus, named after founder Marcus Goldman. Individuals once needed $10 million to get the attention of Goldman's elite private bankers. Today, customers can open a Marcus savings account with as little as $1.

New initiatives under way include checkout-counter loans for shoppers, wealth management and household-budgeting tools for the masses as well as insurance, mortgages and car loans, according to people familiar with the plans.

Goldman is scooping up financial-technology startups and pitching its bank accounts to Fortune 500 companies as an employee perk, much as they offer gym memberships or health insurance. Seeking customers, Goldman -- so secretive its name doesn't appear on its headquarters -- sent out 178 million pieces of direct mail last year and bought television ads during the NFL playoffs, a first for the firm.

In October, it rented a Manhattan lounge and hired an improv-comedy troupe to riff on consumer debt. Guests ate truffle ""macaroni and fees"" and artisanal doughnuts and took home scented candles bearing Goldman's logo.

The consumer-banking push is a high-stakes bet for Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman's CEO since 2006. A former metals salesman, he rose to power before the financial crisis by pushing Goldman's traders into ever-riskier territory. During the crisis, the firm's reputation took a hit when it was cast as a central villain behind the mortgage meltdown. Today, as trading profits dwindle under new regulations and market shifts, Mr. Blankfein's legacy hinges on the firm's ability to make money in more mundane ways.

Last year, he called a few Marcus borrowers to thank them personally for their business. He wades weekly through customer complaints that find their way to his email inbox, forwarding the thorniest to Stephen Scherr, a former investment banker who oversees the consumer push.

Marcus has lent $2.5 billion so far and has 350,000 customers across loans and savings accounts. It employs about 700 people in New York, Salt Lake and Dallas reporting to Harit Talwar, who joined in 2015 from Discover Financial Services.

""Yes, we have ambitions,"" Mr. Talwar said in an interview on the 26th floor of Goldman's Manhattan headquarters, where a popcorn machine sits in the corner and borrower testimonials hang on the walls. He was sporting Allbirds, a knit woolen sneaker popular in Silicon Valley -- the footwear equivalent of a hoodie. A sign on the conference-room door marked it as the meeting spot for ""Project Cookie,"" one of several code-named initiatives the Marcus team is pursuing.

""The consumer is at the center of everything we do,"" Mr. Talwar said. ""If we can ease pain-points in a way that is profitable for the firm, then we will consider it.""

The epicenter is Salt Lake City. Two blocks from the temple of the Mormon Church, which happens to be the bank's landlord, headset-clad customer-service representatives answer questions from small-time borrowers.

On the firm's New York trading desks, new employees dream of being named a Goldman partner. On Main Street in Salt Lake City, they vie for ""Big Bird"" status, a top title on the floor earned through positive customer feedback.

Banking giants such as Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have balance sheets and customer rolls that Goldman can't match. Online startups face less regulation. Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google have an edge in recruiting top talent and leeway from investors to enter new businesses at will.

""We don't take them lightly,"" Discover CFO Mark Graf said of Goldman at a recent industry conference. ""But we're not tossing and turning in our beds at night.""

Retail banking may be a simple corner of financial services, but it has tripped up firms with longer track records than Goldman. Plus, the bank is getting into consumer credit at a time when loan losses are on the rise at competitors.

Goldman has sunk $500 million into the consumer business as it slashes costs elsewhere and struggles to boost profitability. And even if Marcus works, it will be a blip on the bottom line for years: The company projects the business will generate about $450 million in pretax income over the next three years, just 1% of what analysts expect from the firm overall.

Still, consumer lending is more profitable than many of Goldman's other activities, particularly trading, which can no longer rely on vast borrowings to boost returns. Goldman estimates Marcus loans will produce a return on equity in the high teens, compared with Goldman's firmwide figure of 9.2% over the past three years. And retail deposits give Goldman more-stable funding at a lower cost than relying on loans secured by its holdings of securities.

Goldman must learn softer skills as it works to cover crisis-era reputational bruises and put on a friendly face, or at least a friendly voice on the phone. ""This is new territory,"" said Darin Cline, a former Navy pilot who runs operations in Salt Lake City.

Walking the floor in Western boots and helicopter cuff links, he ensures that calls are answered by a live person within 30 seconds. ""We know we have to get this right,"" he said.

The consumer business was born in the summer of 2014 in the Hamptons, according to people who were there, when a half-dozen executives gathered for a strategy session at the weekend home of Gary Cohn, Goldman's then-No. 2 executive who later left the firm to join the Trump administration. Goldman's revenues had been flat.

At a picnic table in the yard, the group asked: Where could Goldman grow? They landed on consumer lending.

Goldman dominated the institutional end of finance, as an adviser to corporate CEOs and trading partner to hedge-fund managers. It ignored retail banking, which executives deemed small-time. Longtime finance chief David Viniar for years kept a toaster in his office as a reminder of Main Street gimmicks to avoid.

But without expensive branch networks and legacy systems, Goldman executives believed they could outmaneuver large commercial banks. Meanwhile, the firm's $900 billion balance sheet would be an advantage over thinly capitalized online-lending startups.

Marcus launched in 2016, offering personal loans of a few thousand dollars, primarily to refinance credit-card debt. Goldman considered names including eQuipt and Clarifi, trademarking both, before one of its executives passed by a portrait, hanging outside Mr. Blankfein's office, of the firm's founder, a German immigrant who in 1869 opened a one-room office on Manhattan's Pine Street.

New products are coming. First up, according to people familiar with them, is ""point-of-sale"" credit, small loans offered to retail customers at checkout in stores and online. Shoppers borrowed $226 billion for purchases last year, charging the vast majority of it to their credit cards, according to consulting firm First Annapolis.

Goldman aims to siphon off some of that business by striking partnerships with big retailers to offer Marcus loans, which charge on average about 5 percentage points less than plastic.

In October, the firm hired Citigroup Inc.'s head of store credit cards. He was given the task of finding similar partnerships for Goldman.

The bank is in talks with Apple Inc. to finance iPhone sales, The Wall Street Journal reported this month. It has reached out to large retailers including Amazon about extending credit for consumer purchases, and is looking for ways to lend for vacations, home furnishings and elective medical procedures, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Goldman has also explored a mass home-mortgage business and auto lending, though it remains wary of the potential public-relations pitfalls in both markets, the people said.

In perhaps its most dramatic foray, Goldman is building a digital wealth-management platform that it plans to roll out this year, the people familiar with the matter said. Known as robo advisers, these tools use computer algorithms to buy and sell stocks and bonds for ultralow fees, though Goldman is likely to supplement its digital advice with human brokers, the people said.

On the other side of the ledger, Goldman is expanding an online savings-account business it acquired from General Electric Co. in 2016. Paying some of the highest interest rates available, it has added $8 billion to the roughly $9 billion in deposits that came over from GE. Goldman has said the business will begin offering savings accounts in the U.K. this year.

Building products is one thing. Finding customers is another. Goldman sent out about as many pieces of direct mail in 2017 as Bank of America, according to Mintel Comperemedia, a research firm. It has joined with Fidelity Investments and Intuit Inc., a maker of tax-preparation and accounting software for small-business owners, to pitch loans to their users.

Ayco, a financial-planning service Goldman acquired in 2003, since last fall has built websites for 70 companies including International Business Machines Corp. and General Motors Co. that help rank-and-file employees understand and manage their finances, executives said. The goal is eventually to plug in Goldman's wealth-management services, 401(k) offerings and other Marcus offerings, pitching them to hundreds of thousands of potential customers.

To build these new products, Goldman has made a flood of outside hires, many of whom don't fit the mold of its blue-blooded bankers and traders. Marcus's head of marketing, Dustin Cohn, spent a decade at PepsiCo Inc.'s Gatorade division and underwear retailer Jockey International Inc. The division's chief systems architect, ex-PayPal Holdings Inc. executive Greg Berry, has a nose ring. When advised to wear a suit to a Goldman orientation session, he showed up in a purple jacket, silver bow tie and Converse tennis shoes.

Goldman is on a shopping spree in Silicon Valley, breaking with its longstanding aversion to acquisitions. It spent around $20 million to acquire Honest Dollar, a nine-month-old 401(k) startup, in 2016, according people familiar with the deal. It is in talks to acquire Clarity Money, a personal-budgeting app, for a price in the high eight figures, according to people familiar with the matter -- an eyebrow-raising valuation for a startup that had 500,000 users as of September.

Some engineering hires have privately grumbled about Goldman's stuffy culture and technology limitations. When coders hired last year from a lending startup asked to use Slack, a group-messaging app popular in Silicon Valley, Goldman's compliance team rejected the request, pointing them to a stodgier alternative, Microsoft Corp.'s Lync. Honest Dollar's founder left last year.

Meanwhile, some of Goldman's investment banking clients in Silicon Valley are bristling as a trusted adviser turns into a rival. The then-CEO of LendingClub Corp. phoned Mr. Cohn -- Goldman's then-No. 2 -- to complain after he learned about Marcus, according to people familiar with the episode. His gripe: Goldman had taken LendingClub public -- a plum assignment that gave it access to the lender's strategies -- without mentioning it was building a competitor.

A few months after that phone call, to help build Marcus from scratch, Goldman hired a top LendingClub operations executive: Mr. Cline."
Ctit Group,Global Growth Fuels Commodities Rally," Feb 27, 2018",1,"A major commodities index posted its 10th straight session of gains on Monday, another sign that investors have shrugged off recent market volatility and are diving back into risky assets.

The S&P GSCI Index, which tracks the prices of 24 commodities, has been moving in tandem with global stock markets since last summer as money managers look to capitalize on accelerating global economic growth. The index has risen 5.9% from its Feb. 9 low, with some of the most actively traded raw materials such as oil and copper rebounding following drops alongside stocks earlier this month.

Those and other commodities benefit from stronger economic growth because they serve as building blocks for everything from houses and office buildings to automobiles and smartphones. Higher levels of industrial activity, low unemployment and bustling shipping routes tend to buoy demand for petroleum and other raw materials, further supporting commodities prices.

With the global economy projected by the International Monetary Fund to grow at its fastest pace since 2011 this year and next year, some investors think a commodities rally that began last summer will continue. As is the case with stocks, some analysts think the fundamentals for investing in raw materials outweigh possible concerns about higher interest rates.

""This is one of the strongest macro backdrops I've seen for investing,"" said Mike Mullaney, director of global market research for fund manager Boston Partners, whose firm has increased positions in energy and materials stocks. ""That lends itself to overweighting some of these commodity-based sectors.""

Unlike stocks, commodities are still relatively cheap. Oil is still off 56% from its 2008 highs, while gold and copper are off 30% and 31%, respectively, from their records set in 2011.

In recent months, stocks around the world and raw materials have traded together, and the recent bounce back for commodities has come as the S&P 500 has recovered 68% of the losses that sent it into correction territory on Feb. 8.

That makes the rally look vulnerable to investors' appetite for risk and the direction of the stock market, some analysts say.

Some analysts think that riskier investments are likely to weaken as central banks around the world unwind years of accommodative monetary policy. Higher interest rates can make commodities less attractive compared with yield-bearing assets such as Treasurys because raw materials pay their holders nothing. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note has risen to four-year highs and is approaching 3%. It closed at 2.862% Monday.

Others think an economic slowdown in China, the world's largest materials consumer, and supply factors continue to loom over the market.

John LaForge, head of real asset strategy for the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he thinks commodities have been too dependent on temporary factors -- such as protests in Iran and labor strikes at mines in Chile and Peru -- that have pinched output. Commodities prices are still way off their peaks, and even with recently rising prices, he doesn't expect that trend to reverse.

""There's still just too much supply,"" Mr. LaForge said.

Other analysts said signs that inflation is picking up should favor commodities. Many investors use raw materials to protect against a surge in consumer prices because they think commodities can hold their value better than other assets. Price increases in commodities also typically contribute to higher inflation as it becomes more expensive for companies to produce goods.

Several large companies, including Ford Motor Co. and Procter & Gamble Co., have already blamed weaker profits or darker outlooks on higher commodities prices. Although persistently low inflation has puzzled economists for years, recent U.S. employment data showed wages notching their biggest increase since 2009.

Doug Cohen, managing partner of portfolio management at Athena Capital Advisors, said the firm has increased its clients' positions in gold and Treasury-inflation protected securities.

""I actually do think this time it's real,"" he said of inflation rising.

Fresh money has been pouring back into commodities funds world-wide: Assets under management reached roughly $530 billion in January, up 13% from the previous month and their highest level in four years, Citigroup estimates show. A JPMorgan Chase analysis showed the largest January inflow of open interest into commodities over the past decade.

""The environment for investing in commodities is the best since 2004-2008,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note to clients earlier this month."
Ctit Group,Streetwise: A Crowd Around the Bond Story," Feb 27, 2018",0,"The reality of inflation and growth has shifted only a little in the past few months. Beliefs about inflation and growth, however, have moved a lot, and investors hoping they will rise fast could be in trouble if reality doesn't catch up soon.

This is most obvious in the bond market. Last summer, gloom about the prospects for inflation prevailed, with hedge funds having more bets on bond yields falling than rising. No longer. The narrative has shifted, and fast money has shifted with it, making some of the biggest bets ever on yields rising.

The risk for investors is that the move from worrying about deflation to worrying about inflation won't happen smoothly. In other words, reality might once again disappoint the market. Yes, bond yields should go up -- over time. But they have soared this year, to the point that the fall in bond prices, which go down when yields go up, is as quick as it has been only four other times since the end of the recession in 2009. Each of those times prices fell too fast and popped back up.

""Cyclically, everyone's very excited,"" said Chris Watling, founder of consulting firm Longview Economics. ""Every asset allocator you talk to seems to be short the 10-year"" Treasury.

Many of the biggest recent swings in bond yields have come when investors were crowded into wrong-way bets. In April 2010, futures traders had what was then a record bet on rising yields, reflecting a consensus that the economy was in a normal postrecession rebound. Suffice to say it wasn't, and those bets were quickly reversed. The same happened at the end of 2016, when postelection excitement about rising yields led to a record bet, but again proved wildly overdone.

The opposite happened in May 2013 and last summer, when investors had some of their biggest postcrisis bets using futures and options on bond yields falling. In both cases, 10-year yields subsequently jumped by close to a percentage point. This month the net bet on rising 10-year Treasury yields reached the second biggest, behind only the rise after the election, while the number of futures-only bets on rising yields hit a record.

This isn't to say that the new consensus is wrong. Global economic growth brings with it a tighter jobs market and more demand, which ought to be inflationary. The worry is that it doesn't arrive quickly enough to confirm investors in their new belief and disappointment sets in. Leveraged funds with large positions would then look exposed, something that often prompts them to close out their bets and would push down bond yields. With tens of billions of dollars of outstanding bets against bond futures, such a rush to cover short positions could have a big effect.

The new market story is of synchronized global growth, tighter monetary policy and higher wages and inflation. The short-term issue isn't so much whether it is right or wrong, but whether everyone yet believes in it. If there are more investors out there who haven't been converted, then economic data supporting the story could push up bond yields further still. If everyone and his dog is already betting on growth and inflation, then the very same data might disappoint those hoping for more.

In Europe, there are already signs of disappointment. Economic data have been coming in below forecasts, pushing Citigroup Inc.'s measure of ""economic surprise"" negative for the first time since September 2016. Again, this suggests not that the eurozone is in trouble, but merely that economists upgraded their forecasts too enthusiastically.

Now, I'm a natural contrarian and may again be overestimating how far the story has to run. After the U.S. election I thought it was right that bond yields should rise, but that they had gone up far too quickly given the uncertainties about Donald Trump's policies. I was too early, and 10-year Treasury yields rose another 0.3 percentage point -- a fall of almost 3% in price -- before the market began to share my concerns about how long it would take to implement tax cuts and infrastructure spending.

A repeat is possible. Fund-manager sentiment toward bonds is very negative, but not as negative as it was after the election or during the 2013 taper tantrum. Bond yields have risen fast, but not as fast as they did after the election. Bets on inflation over the next five years being above 3% -- derived from inflation options -- are still below where they stood after the election, too. All these measures could run further, and hedge funds and others could pile on even bigger bets on rising yields.

Yet, the balance of risks has shifted. Wage growth that would have been a positive surprise last summer would today be a damp squib for investors who are expecting a continuation of last month's fireworks. U.S. Treasurys may still look unattractive at a 10-year yield of just under 2.9%, but remember that it has only been above 3% for two days since July 2011. The market is adopting a new narrative, but it would be normal to have plot twists as the story works out."
Ctit Group,How Pundits Never Get It Wrong: Call a 40% Chance --- Forecasting tactic covers all outcomes; it's a 'distinct possibility'," Feb 27, 2018",0,"Corrections & Amplifications

The front-month crude-oil futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange reached $26.21 a barrel on Feb. 11, 2016. A Page One article on Feb. 27 about the 40% rule in forecasting incorrectly said that oil fell to $30.

(WSJ March 10, 2018)

What are the chances that readers will make it to the end of this article? About 40%.

If you do make it, that prediction will look smart. If you don't, well, we said the odds were against it.

Such is the nature of the 40% rule, a favorite forecasting tactic of Wall Street analysts and other prognosticators trying to make a bold call without being too bold.

Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair said last month there's a 40% chance that Brexit will be reversed; Citigroup Inc. analyst Jim Suva wrote that there's a 40% chance Apple Inc. buys Netflix Inc.; and Nomura Holdings Inc. economist Lewis Alexander said there's a 40% chance Nafta gets ripped up.

The nice thing about 40% is that you never have to say you were wrong, says Peter Tchir, a market strategist at Academy Securities. Say you predict the Dow Jones Industrial Average has a 40% chance of hitting 30000 before year-end.

""Get it right and you can say 'See, I was telling everyone it could happen,'"" he says. ""Get it wrong and you can weasel your way out: 'I didn't say it was likely, I just said it was a strong possibility.'""

With a 24-hour news cycle, outlets from cable channels to newspapers are always looking for an expert to weigh in. If they offer an audacious estimate that will get clicks, all the better. The trend has boosted the industry of analysts and talking heads who predict everything from elections to corporate earnings.

A whiff can ding a forecaster's reputation.

Nate Silver became America's most famous election forecaster when he called all 50 states correctly in the 2012 presidential election. Four years later he was criticized for repeatedly projecting that Donald Trump stood no chance in the Republican primary and for his final projection that gave Hillary Clinton a 71% chance of victory.

Mr. Silver says he deserves some criticism for his primary projections, but not his general election forecast, which he called ""highly informative and useful"" since others gave Mr. Trump a smaller chance.

To protect their reputations, pundits hedge. They may not provide a date by which a forecast will occur. They often ""cluster"" forecasts together with other analysts around a ""consensus"" figure so that everyone will probably be the same amount of wrong.

Citigroup's Mr. Suva forgot to hedge. He put a 40% chance on Apple buying Netflix, but also a 25% chance Apple buys Walt Disney Co., a 10% chance each it buys one of three videogame makers, and a 5% chance it buys Tesla Inc. That sums to 100%, implying it is mathematically certain Apple buys one of them.

A Citigroup spokeswoman said Mr. Suva doesn't believe a deal for one of those companies is guaranteed. She said the forecast was really a conditional probability, contingent on Apple using its huge cash pile for what she called a ""mega deal,"" which she said Mr. Suva actually views as less likely than a large stock buyback. The conditional probability wasn't specified in Mr. Suva's research note.

""Pundits and gurus master the art of going out on a limb without going out on limb,"" says Philip Tetlock, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has made a career analyzing which people forecast well, and why. One of his pet peeves is how gurus use vague terms like ""distinct possibility"" instead of percentage odds when they describe probabilities. That makes it easy to wiggle out of, or take credit for a forecast, since it isn't clear at all what a distinct possibility is.

But one drawback of percentage odds, Mr. Tetlock says, is that people are often unclear on what they actually mean.

Mr. Silver can relate. Some of his harshest critics took his 71% projection of a Clinton victory as a sure thing that she would win, he says. ""You wouldn't cross the street if there was a 30% chance you'd get hit.""

Courageous contrarian calls are the best way forecasters capture the public's attention, and get television time. New York University Professor Nouriel Roubini was dubbed ""Dr. Doom"" for correctly predicting the financial crisis. Then in 2010 he projected a 40% chance of a ""double-dip recession"" in the U.S. It didn't happen.

Mr. Roubini says he doesn't remember the projection, but that he takes pride in sticking his neck out, as with his latest call that Bitcoin is the biggest bubble in history and will go to zero.

""I would not rule out that I've committed the sin of the 40% rule,"" said Prof. Roubini. ""Everybody has done so.""

""There's an aspect of infotainment"" that Wall Street forecasters always keep in mind, says John Kilduff, portfolio manager at commodities hedge fund Again Capital. In September 2015 Mr. Kilduff told CNBC viewers that crude oil had a 40% shot at falling to $20 per barrel. Then at $45, oil followed its downward trend before bottoming at $30.

""You're always riding the hero-shithead roller coaster,"" says Mr. Kilduff, ""we all have plenty of haters, and they're even more visible now with Twitter."" He noted one correspondent who took a forecast personally. ""Hope you lose EVERYTHING [on] your short,"" the person wrote in a salty email reviewed by the Journal. The correspondent also called Mr. Kilduff ugly.

""The old 40% trick!"" recalled Stephen Roach, formerly Morgan Stanley's chief economist. ""A warning of a looming forecast change, a rising risk assessment, a way to cover your rear -- or a combination of all three."" Mr. Roach said that by stamping a 40% probability on a possible outlier he could call clients' attention to shifting winds without changing his underlying forecast.

A nonrigorous examination of Mr. Roach's past forecasts showed he put a 40% chance on two recession predictions in 2002 and 2004, and then another recession projection in 2010. All of those he got wrong, or rather, got right, since he said the odds were against.

The 40% rule can be useful for all manner of punditry. British boxer Anthony Joshua speculated in 2015 that underdog Tyson Fury had a 40% shot to beat heavily favored champ Wladimir Klitschko. Mr. Fury won, and now wants to fight Mr. Joshua. A spokesman for Mr. Joshua didn't respond when asked what chance the boxer would give himself against Mr. Fury.

By the way, if you made it this far, we always predicted you might."

Ctit Group,Peak Optimism Looks To Have Hit Its Apex," Feb 24, 2018",1,"Things can't only get better. After a stellar run, economic survey data from Europe sagged this week. The picture is still one of strong growth, but investors may still need to consider the subtle shift in what has been a remarkable comeback story for markets.

Three surveys on conditions in February all proved weaker than the consensus forecast this week. First, the European Commission's flash consumer confidence indicator for the eurozone fell to 0.1, down 1.3 points from January.

Then, the IHS Markit flash composite eurozone purchasing managers index declined to 57.5 from 58.8. Finally, the German Ifo Business Climate Index dropped to 115.4 from 117.6.

Of course, investors shouldn't read too much into one week's data. And in each case, the readings are still close to multiyear highs. The Ifo index in January matched its highest level ever on data going back to 1991. Meanwhile, the purchasing managers index is pointing to a first-quarter growth rate of 0.9% from a quarter earlier, IHS Markit says, particularly strong for the eurozone. In 2017, the currency bloc enjoyed its strongest year of growth for a decade, expanding 2.5%.

But for markets, there could be change afoot as the reassurance of data consistently beating expectations fades.

The Citigroup economic surprise index for the eurozone, which tracks whether economic data is beating or missing expectations, has fallen below zero this week for the first time since September 2016, after its longest streak in positive territory since at least 2003. If expectations have finally caught up with reality, then there is a greater chance of disappointment for the first time in a while.

Ultimately, the level of growth in the eurozone looks encouraging. But the acceleration that marked 2017 may have topped out for now."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Citi's Refund Tab: $335 Million --- Bank's internal review found fault in how it adjusted rates for credit-card customers," Feb 24, 2018",1,"Citigroup Inc., one of the largest U.S. credit-card issuers, said it failed to lower interest rates for some credit-card customers as required by federal law.

The bank on Friday said that it plans to issue about $335 million in refunds to affected customers, or about $190 on average per affected account.

Citigroup said the issue stemmed from the bank increasing annual percentage rates on cards after customers missed payments as well as other reasons. The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act requires card issuers who increase rates to review those accounts every six months.

Issuers are then supposed to reduce the rate if the reason for the increase is no longer a problem. That could include, for example, a cardholder establishing a pattern of again paying the bill on time.

Citigroup said the issue affected roughly 1.75 million U.S. credit-card accounts over a period ranging from 2011 to 2017.

Some of those accounts received smaller rate reductions than they should have, while others didn't receive any reduction, the bank said. They included the bank's regular credit cards, co-branded cards that it has with merchants, and credit cards that can be used only at specific stores.

The bank said it delivered about 90% of the savings to customers as required by the interest-rate reduction requirement, resulting in more than $3 billion in savings.

The bank has about 120 million U.S. credit-card accounts and had a total of about 250 million U.S. credit-card accounts during the period in which the problems occurred. Citigroup is the third-largest U.S. credit-card issuer by total volume and by outstanding balances, according to the Nilson Report.

The bank, which disclosed the issue in its annual securities filing made Friday, saida periodic internal review identifiedthe flaws in its methodology. Citigroup reported the issue to its regulators, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

""While we believed our methodology was sound, a periodic internal review identified potential flaws in the methodology,"" a bank spokeswoman said. ""We informed our regulators, revised our methodology going forward and conducted a comprehensive review of our process."" She added that the bank found no evidence of employee misconduct, but that it ""should have identified these issues sooner.""

Citigroup hasn't finalized the list of consumers affected and said they include current and former cardholders.

The bank's credit-card division generated more than $100 billion in revenue from 2011 to 2017. The bank stands out from many of its competitors by offering long promotional zero percent interest rates on its cards to entice consumers to sign up.

It also sends out many balance-transfer offers with zero-percent promotional rates to entice existing customers to transfer credit-card balances they have with other issuers."

LITIGATION

FDIC Sues 16 Banks

In Libor Rigging Case

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. sued 16 banks connected to the Libor rigging scandal as part of its effort to recover funds related to Doral Bank, a Puerto Rican institution that collapsed in 2015.

In its lawsuit, the FDIC argued the banks' collusion on fixing the London interbank offered rate -- a benchmark rate used to set the prices of trillions of dollars in loans and derivatives -- had hampered Doral's competitiveness by, among other things, breaching swap contracts with the failed bank.

""Doral and the [FDIC]'s injuries arose from the harm to competition"" as a result of Libor fixing by the large banks, the complaint said. ""These injuries flow directly from the substitution of collusion for competition in the market for [over-the-counter] interest-rate derivatives.""

The FDIC's move follows an ongoing lawsuit filed by the FDIC in 2014 against the same large financial institutions accused of participating in a Libor manipulating scheme, including Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The earlier lawsuit alleged Libor manipulations had harmed 38 banks the FDIC had placed in receivership after they collapsed.

Doral Bank was closed by Puerto Rico regulators in February 2015, in the largest U.S. bank failure since 2010.

The bank, which shut down with $5.9 billion in assets, was sold to Banco Popular de Puerto Rico."
Ctit Group,Startups Are Investing in Homes --- Buyers get help from a crop of Silicon Valley upstarts that partner on purchases," Feb 20, 2018",1,"Some well-funded startups have an unusual pitch for homeowners strapped for cash: Let's own this house together.

A handful of companies, including those backed by marquee Silicon Valley names such as Andreessen Horowitz and Mark Zuckerberg's philanthropic organization, are experimenting with a product that essentially lets them take an ownership position in a house along with the homeowner. The agreements, called ""shared-equity"" contracts, provide a new way for investors to get exposure to rising home prices across the U.S.

Shared-equity products are aimed at new buyers who need help with a down payment, or current homeowners looking for an alternative to a cash-out mortgage refinancing or a home-equity loan. The first use has caught the attention of mortgage-finance giant Freddie Mac, which recently agreed to buy loans on properties where one firm, Unison Agreement Corp., contributes to the down payment.

In those cases, home buyers get money for part of their down payment in exchange for pledging some of the home's future price appreciation. The firms market them as a better alternative to low-down-payment loans, since they can give consumers more buying power without requiring them to take out pricey mortgage insurance.

Landed Inc. offers these down-payment contracts to teachers and other educators. Last year, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a philanthropy co-founded by Facebook Inc.'s chief executive, gave Landed $5 million to start a new fund.

Michael Nizhnikov found out about Unison's shared-equity product from his mortgage lender, Guaranteed Rate Inc. He used it for half of the 20% down payment on a home when he moved to accept a position in the psychology department at Southern Connecticut State University.

Dr. Nizhnikov, 46 years old, said the idea of sharing ownership of his home at first was a bit disconcerting. One thing that won him over: If his home's value falls, Unison shares in the loss. ""We get to feel comfortable, just in case something crazy happens,"" Dr. Nizhnikov said.

The length of the contracts can vary from a few years to 30. Homeowners can repay early, including if they sell their house before the term ends. How much they end up owing depends on how the value of their home changes. Because the funds are equity, not a borrowing, they don't require monthly payments.

For example, a Unison customer could receive $50,000 toward a $100,000 down payment on a $500,000 house. If the home later sells for $600,000, the customer gets back the $50,000 he or she initially put down plus 65% of the $100,000 appreciation. Unison gets back its $50,000 plus the other $35,000 of appreciated value. (That is keeping the mortgage constant at $400,000 for illustrative purposes.)

And if the home goes down in value? Unison shares in the loss. Say the home sells for $400,000. After paying back the $400,000 mortgage, the homeowner's $50,000 in equity is wiped out. Unison only shares in 35% of the loss. That means the homeowner is on the hook for the difference and needs to pay Unison $15,000.

Shared-equity contracts can help home buyers unload some risk of a decline in property values, but they also can end up being expensive if housing prices rise. ""The homeowners who are going to do this are the ones who don't have a lot of choices,"" said Allan Weiss, who founded a home-price analytics firm that bears his name.

Patch Homes Inc., Point Digital Finance Inc. and Unison are among the companies that are marketing these products as an alternative to home-equity loans and cash-out refinancings. Unlike those products, shared-equity contracts don't add to the consumer's outstanding debt and tend to have looser qualification standards.

Raju Mann of Marin County, Calif., took out about $85,000 through a shared-equity contract on her home from Point in 2016. She was encouraged by the startup's shareholders, which include Andreessen Horowitz and former Citigroup Inc. CEO Vikram Pandit.

Ms. Mann, 54, said banks rejected her for loans because her sources of income -- including royalties on the sale of books written by her grandfather, Nobel Prize-winning author Thomas Mann -- were unpredictable.

After getting funds from Point, Ms. Mann used the money to pay off debt. Home prices were rising in her neighborhood, though, and the longer she waited to pay back Point, the more the firm would make. She decided to exit her contract last month, using money she got refinancing her existing mortgage. Ultimately, she wound up paying Point around $120,000. ""They made good money with me,"" Ms. Mann said.

Unison said it has done 600 agreements in the past year; the other firms have done fewer. To the firms, the idea is to give homeowners the same option that companies have in raising funds via both debt and equity. The firms also typically charge fees for arranging the contracts.

For investors, yields can be attractive. Kingsbridge Wealth Management Inc., a Las Vegas-based multifamily office, has placed around $3 million into a fund that Point manages since May 2016, earning an internal rate of return of roughly 16%, said Kingsbridge President David J. Dunn.

But there also is risk that investors' capital will be tied up for years before recognizing any gains.

High-school biology teacher Sara Shayesteh and her husband, Isaac, used an agreement with Landed to cover about half their down payment for their home in San Mateo, Calif.

The Shayestehs have 10 years to repay Landed, but can choose to do so after one year. They said it feels odd to have an investor own part of their house but are grateful for the arrangement. ""We're trying to live in a crazy area with a market,"" said Ms. Shayesteh, 32. ""There's no other way we could have purchased a property that would have met our needs."""

The chief executives of the banks, which include JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley, were paid on average $25.3 million for their work last year, up 17% from 2016, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

For the group as a whole, combined total compensation of about $126 million is the highest annual tally since before the financial crisis.

The gains mark the fifth consecutive year in which pay rose for Wall Street's top CEOs. In 2017, the increases reflected stronger profits for banks driven by an expanding economy, rising employment, loosening regulations under President Donald Trump and an improving interest-rate backdrop for lending.

Citigroup was the latest to report that it was increasing the boss's compensation. CEO Michael Corbat was paid $23 million for his work in 2017, up 48% from his $15.5 million payday in 2016.

Goldman Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein was awarded a $24 million pay package, up 9% from the prior year.

Most of the annual compensation announced over the past month at the nation's largest banks comes in the form of incentive bonuses, often stock-based and not cashed until later. And all the pay packages still pale in comparison to Mr. Blankfein's $68.5 million award for 2007 when trading profits and risk-taking drove results for Goldman and its peers.

Still, this bonus season for Wall Street CEOs is in many ways the best in more than a decade. All five CEOs were awarded at least $20 million, something that hasn't happened since 2006, according to a Wall Street Journal review of banks' proxy statements. Mr. Corbat, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan and Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman each enjoyed their best annual pay packages as chief executive.

Mr. Blankfein received a cash salary of $2 million -- steady from 2016, when he got a pay cut -- plus a cash bonus of $4.4 million and the remainder in stock units whose value will depend on how Goldman does over the next few years, accordingto a regulatory filing Friday.

That puts him in the middle of the pack among Wall Street chiefs. JPMorgan Chase's James Dimon got a 5% raise to $29.5 million. Mr. Gorman followed at $27 million after a 20% pay raise. Wells Fargo & Co., which doesn't have a large Wall Street presence, hasn't yet disclosed its CEO's compensation.

Goldman's revenue in 2017 rose 5%. Setting aside the impact of a hit from the recently passed tax-overhaul law, its return on equity was 10.8%, one of only two banks to crack double digits.

Yet its core business of fixed-income trading had its worst year since the financial crisis. The firm bet wrong on things including interest rates, the U.S. dollar and natural gas. Mr. Blankfein once ran that business and remains closely associated with its performance.

The biggest jump in pay came for Mr. Corbat, the lone Wall Street CEO of the five who isn't also the bank's chairman. Citigroup posted a loss of $6.2 billion for 2017, though that was because of a charge the bank took to prepare for the new tax law. The board said it had considered Citigroup's underlying results, as well as the bank's increased shareholder dividends and its passing grade on the Federal Reserve's stress test.

It has been a long road for Mr. Corbat to crack the $20 million pay mark. For his first full year as CEO, 2013, he was awarded $14.5 million. The following three years, his pay wavered between $13 million and $16.5 million, as Citigroup struggled to increase profitability and break out of past regulatory problems.

For his work in 2017, Mr. Corbat is getting a cash bonus of $6.45 million, to go along with his $1.5 million salary. The rest of the package comprises stock that is dependent on the bank's performance. This is also deferred, meaning it will be paid out over coming years. That structure is meant to tie Mr. Corbat's compensation to the bank's longer-term performance.

Last year, Citigroup's board cut his pay because of ""the firm's performance relative to its financial targets."" This year, the board said Mr. Corbat had demonstrated ""exceptional leadership in multiple critical areas,"" including risk management and talent management. It also said it considered the pay of CEOs at peer institutions."
Ctit Group,Inflation Data Keep Markets on Edge," Feb 14, 2018",1,"Throughout last year, investors worried about a phantom menace that could upset markets: higher U.S. inflation. They were wrong, to their own pleasant surprise. Now they could be right, which creates its own complications.

The key thing to consider is the power of expectations -- perhaps the most important force in financial markets. For some, higher inflation has been a worry ever since global central banks engaged in extraordinary monetary policy. But consumer-price inflation has been puzzlingly absent: Last year, former Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen labeled the behavior of U.S. inflation a ""mystery.""

The fuss now might seem odd given headline inflation has been rising since its nadir in 2015. But crucially, it didn't rise as much as expected last year, and a lot of the move was down to a rebound in energy prices. Economists, who help shape market expectations, persistently forecast higher U.S. inflation than what emerged. That can be seen in Citigroup's U.S. inflation surprise index, which has been in negative territory even as its eurozone and Japanese peers have picked up.

The lack of inflationary worries meant stronger global growth captured investors' attention last year. Equity markets posted big gains, while fixed-income investors were remarkably relaxed about U.S. monetary policy, keeping long-term bond yields contained. Combined with better growth, particularly in Europe, the dollar weakened throughout 2017. That helped support risk appetite in emerging markets, brightening the economic outlook further.

But the backdrop has changed. The recent violent market swings started with an apparent pickup in U.S. wage growth. Added to that are concerns about U.S. tax and spending policy, piled on top of already loose monetary policy. U.S. bond yields haven't fallen even as markets have grown turbulent.

January inflation data out Wednesday is therefore key. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expect headline inflation at 1.9% and core inflation, excluding food and energy, at 1.7%. If the numbers start overshooting expectations, markets could get another jolt. So many got inflation wrong for so long, that getting it right is its own form of surprise."
Ctit Group,Broadcom Lines Up Qualcomm Financing," Feb 12, 2018",1,"Broadcom Ltd. secured as much as $100 billion of debt financing for its hostile bid for Qualcomm Inc. and enlisted two more big private-equity firms, strengthening the chip giant's hand in the takeover battle.

A dozen banks -- including Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley -- have agreed to provide up to $100 billion of committed credit facilities, including a $5 billion revolver and bridge financing, according to people familiar with the matter.

Private-equity firms KKR & Co. and CVC Capital Partners agreed to join Silver Lake in providing $6 billion in convertible debt for the deal and postclosing working-capital needs, the people said.

Broadcom has been in pursuit of Qualcomm since November and has nominated a slate of directors that would be voted on at a meeting in early March. Broadcom a week ago raised its bid to $82 a share in cash and stock, or more than $120 billion.

The commitments would enable Broadcom to fully fund the $60 a share cash portion of the bid.

Locking down funding for the deal would remove a major question mark over Broadcom's bid for Qualcomm, which, if successful, would be the biggest technology takeover ever.

Adding two sophisticated investors could also help propel the effort.

But it still faces major hurdles. Qualcomm has said the price is still too low and faces steep regulatory risks. It has agreed to discuss the takeover attempt with Broadcom, and the two sides were expected to convene early this coming week."
Ctit Group,"Business News: Goldman: Siri, Call Apple --- Firm explores deal in which it would lend to shoppers buying iPhones, other devices"," Feb 8, 2018",1,"As Apple Inc.'s investment bank, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has raised tens of billions of dollars for the technology company. Now, Goldman wants to service Apple's customers, too, a few hundred dollars at a time.

The Wall Street firm is in talks to offer financing to shoppers buying phones, watches and other gadgets from Apple, people familiar with the matter said. Customers purchasing a $1,000 iPhone X could take out a loan from Goldman instead of charging it to credit cards that often carry high interest rates.

Talks between the tech company and the investment bank are continuing and could still fall apart. A spokesman for Goldman declined to comment. Apple didn't respond to requests for comment.

The partnership would be a coup for Goldman as it tries to expand its new consumer bank. Better known as an elite adviser to corporations and governments, Goldman is embracing retail banking and plain-vanilla lending in pursuit of growth as some traditional areas of strength, namely trading, slump.

In 2016, Goldman launched Marcus, an online lending division that helps people refinance credit-card debt. Goldman is now building a ""point-of-sale"" financing business that will offer loans to shoppers at checkout, according to people familiar with the firm, effectively finding those customers one step earlier.

Shoppers in 2017 borrowed more than $200 billion for purchases using credit cards affiliated with retailers or point-of-sale loans, consulting firm First Annapolis estimates. Some $80 billion went toward big-ticket items like furniture and electronics that can take months to pay off, racking up extra interest as borrowers roll over balances from month to month.

By offering a lower-cost loan, Goldman hopes to siphon off some of that business. Goldman charges 12% interest on its average Marcus loans. Credit cards can charge upward of 20% and carry late fees and other charges.

Partnerships with big retailers like Apple are key. They can deliver millions of customers that Goldman would struggle to find on its own.

The bank in October hired Scott Young from Citigroup Inc., where he ran retail credit-card partnerships and helped snag the Costco Wholesale Corp. relationship away from American Express Co. He is responsible for striking similar deals for Goldman, which aims to finance purchases ranging from vacations to home furnishings to orthodontics. The bank will start by offering loans similar to its existing Marcus product, but is exploring adding traditional store-brand credit cards down the road, thepeople familiar with the matter said.

Apple introduced a program in 2015 with Citizens Financial Group Inc., in which the regional bank offered zero-interest loans for iPhone upgrades and higher-interest options for other device purchases. Part of Goldman's talks with Apple involves taking over some form of the upgrade program. It is unclear whether anything will change with the handling of the outstanding Citizens loans. The Providence, R.I.-based bank didn't have an immediate comment.

The program started as wireless providers were scaling back subsidies for iPhones. It allows customers to pay for a new iPhone with a 24-month financing plan and upgrade to a new device after making 12 payments, a strategy that helps keep customers coming back for the newest models.

For Apple, the upgrade program is taking on increasing importance as its high-priced devices create sticker shock for some."
Ctit Group,Margin Lending Likely to Shrink," Feb 7, 2018",1,"When stock markets hit air pockets like the past couple of days, margin calls are never far behind. This time, banks already have reason to be nervous about lending against shares.

Investors borrow to boost bets on stocks, using margin loans. But when prices fall, investors have to either stump up more cash to repay some of the debt or sell shares.

When things move too quickly, it is the banks and brokers that made the loans who take a bath.

Borrowing is very high in current markets, although by one measure it isn't as aggressive as it has been. Banks, however, have more reason to worry than in recent times: Many of them were hit with a sudden and very painful loss in this business late last year.

That means they could limit new margin lending or start cutting back on what they already have given to clients. That would remove one leg of support that has helped buoy stock markets.

Net borrowing by U.S. investors in securities margin accounts is at record levels, according to data from Haver Analytics.

Debt balances of nearly $290 billion at the end of November 2017 were more than double the levels of early 2000 ahead of the dot-com crash.

However, stock prices have risen significantly, too, which means all that debt is backed by more valuable collateral. The total value of stock loans as a share of the market capitalization of all U.S. stocks is elevated but lower than during the financial crisis. In the past few years it has held rela-tively steady, suggesting debt was rising only in line with the market.

Even though margin lending is deemed low risk by regulators -- because the shares that back the loans should be easy to sell in an orderly downturn -- banks have a big reason to cut their exposure.

Last year, a scandal around the South African retail group Steinhoff International Holdings landed many with huge losses on a single stock-backed loan to the group's former chairman.

For the banks involved that have reported 2017 results -- Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs Group, JPMorgan Chase, UBS Group and BNP Paribas -- the losses they suffered were equivalent to seeing fourth-quarter revenue from equities trading cut between almost 10% and 20%.

That is hard to take, but what is worse is getting caught out again by a bigger market selloff. As investors adjust to where markets might go next, they are likely to be getting calls from brokers to say they won't have as much credit to play with as they have been recently enjoying. And that is probably no bad thing."
Ctit Group,"Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Wells Fargo Feels the Pinch From Fed --- Bank's stock sinks in wake of enforcement action, wiping out $29 billion in value"," Feb 6, 2018",1,"A selloff in Wells Fargo & Co. shares chopped $29 billion from the bank's market value after the Federal Reserve cast it into a regulatory purgatory and limited its ability to expand its business.

Shares tumbled 9.2% on Monday amid a broader selloff in stock prices, as analysts ratcheted down earnings estimates for the third-largest U.S. bank by assets. The decline, its sharpest one-day drop since April 2009, was especially painful because the recently bright outlook for banks was also thrown into question Monday.

The acute market declines shifted, at least for now, bank investors' optimism about stronger economic growth, rising interest rates and lighter regulation. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index dropped 4.9%, slightly more than the 4.6% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Still, Wells Fargo has been hit the hardest. Since the start of the year, Wells Fargo's shares have lost 4.2%, while its biggest peers have gained between 2% and 3%.

Meanwhile, the bank's price/earnings ratio has fallen below that of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp.

The challenge now facing Wells Fargo was on display Friday night in an analyst call held less than two hours after the Fed announced an unprecedented enforcement action and said the bank would replace four board directors by year-end.

Chief Executive Officer Timothy Sloan said five times on the call that the bank is ""open for business.""

Wells Fargo in its presentation to analysts Friday night said that it expected the Fed action to reduce 2018 after-tax profit by between $300 million and $400 million.

Such a reduction comes at an inopportune time for Wells Fargo. Over the past three quarters, the bank's net interest income -- a gauge of lending profitability -- has fallen. At the same time, the bank has been in the midst of an effort to cut $4 billion in annual costs by 2019.

In the wake of the Fed's growth cap, half a dozen analysts on Monday cut estimates for 2018 earnings per share to an average of $4.71 from a previous average of $4.83. Some of those analysts trimmed forecasts for 2019 earnings to an average of $5.16, down from an average of $5.40.

KBW bank analyst Brian Kleinhanzl downgraded Wells Fargo to ""market perform"" from ""outperform"" and lowered his earnings-per-share estimates to $4.70 from $4.90 for 2018 and to $5.10 from $5.45 for 2019.

""The bottom line is that the [Fed] order will mean Wells will have a harder time maintaining market share and will have to compete more on price or credit terms versus peers,"" he wrote.

Gerard Cassidy, an RBC Capital bank analyst, also voiced concerns about competition, writing that ""existing customers could be pried away from the company by aggressive competitors."" He added that given a positive outlook for the banking industry, investors would be better off owning JPMorgan, Bank of America or Citigroup Inc., which ""will be able to harness the growth of the U.S. economy.""

Wells Fargo executives said Friday that they would use a series of financial maneuvers to limit certain activities so the bank won't have to deny business to its large consumer base. But certain commercial customers could get squeezed.

For instance, the bank may reduce certain commercial deposits known as ""nonoperational,"" of which it had roughly $200 billion as of the end of 2017. That is a tactic JPMorgan used to lower its asset size a few years ago.

Wells Fargo may also limit financial institutions' deposits, which tallied $149 billion at year-end 2017. And it could also reduce its $92 billion in trading assets and $91 billion in short-term investments as of Dec. 31, 2017.

Some analysts were more sanguine. Sanford C. Bernstein's John McDonald wrote Monday that the growth cap will be manageable because Wells Fargo ""was already planning to continue shrinking. . .auto and home-equity loans."" He estimates the two noncore portfolios will decline by about $15 billion this year, ""creating additional flexibility"" for the bank.

Overall, Mr. McDonald said he expects the impact of the Fed moves to go away by next year. He added the growth cap hadn't significantly altered his view of the bank, but he had been modeling just 1% loan growth in 2018.

Some investors were taken aback by the Fed's action and the fact the bank hasn't fully overcome the sales-practices scandal. Still, others were holding on.

Shareholder David Katz said the Fed's action is ""sending another message to Wells that they've got to be more aggressive in getting their act together."" But he said he was confident in the bank's approach to how it can ""meet all the needs"" of clients and manage the balance sheet.

Mr. Katz, who is president and chief investment officer at New York-based Matrix Asset Advisors Inc. that owns about 480,000 Wells Fargo shares, said the firm plans to hold its current position."
Ctit Group,Banks Shut the Door on More Branches," Feb 6, 2018",1,"Banks are closing branches at the fastest pace in decades, as they leave less profitable regions and fewer customers use tellers for routine transactions.

The number of branches in the U.S. shrank by more than 1,700 in the 12-month period ended in June 2017, the biggest decline on record, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of federal data.

Branch numbers fell again in the second half of 2017, according to related data submitted to bank regulators and reviewed by the Journal. That would add to the thousands of locations closed following the financial crisis and is the longest stretch of closures since the Great Depression.

Many of the closings were in big cities and surrounding suburbs, where branches were consolidated largely because of falling foot traffic. Others were in rural areas, where some large regional lenders are leaving town altogether.

While banks battered during the financial crisis such as Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. started cutting branches years ago, regional banks have only accelerated closures more recently. From mid-2012 to mid-2017, Capital One Financial Corp. cut 32% of its branches, SunTrust Banks Inc. 22% and Regions Financial Corp. 12%. For all three, the sharpest cuts came in the most recent 12-month period.

Banks say they carefully consider which branches to close, examining deposit levels at each branch and commute time to the nearest location. ""We continue to evolve and optimize our branch network to ensure that we're operating as efficiently and effectively as possible,"" a Capital One spokeswoman said.

For decades, banks needed to add new locations to expand, pushing the number of U.S. branches to a peak in 2009. But in the aftermath of the financial crisis, some started closing branches to save money and then kept closing them to contend with low interest rates and higher regulatory costs.

Along the way, lenders realized they could maintain their deposit levels with fewer locations in a digital world in which customers often prefer banks' mobile apps and ATMs.

The shift in strategy is helping some banks reach profit records.

For instance, Bank of America's adjusted earnings in 2017 matched its highest annual profit ever. The bank closed or sold more than 1,500 branches since 2009, including the vast majority of its rural branches. The closures have helped the bank save on occupancy and employee costs, bringing down overall expenses. The lower expense levels have bolstered bank profit.

Real-estate auction firm Ten-X says more banks are using its site to sell properties, many at a discount. The firm, which got its start focusing on distressed real estate, is now considering a new group dedicated to branches.

For example, Wells Fargo & Co., which preserved its branch network even as rivals trimmed, has started cutting it back since its sales-practice scandal imploded in 2016.

Regional banks Fifth Third Bancorp in Cincinnati and Regions, based in Birmingham, Ala., disclosed in regulatory filings that they have been selling land that they had once bought for future branch locations.

Banks are still opening new branches, just not enough to make up for the ones they are closing. Bank of America, for instance, has expanded into big cities where it previously didn't have branches. JPMorgan Chase & Co. similarly announced plans to open as many as 400 branches in new markets in coming years.

Some closures involve banks leaving rural areas because branches there aren't profitable enough, according to the Journal analysis. Since mid-2012, PNC Financial Services Group Inc. has cut its branches in rural areas and small towns by nearly one-third. SunTrust has cut its rural branches almost by half.

When PNC closed its only branch in Jeromesville, Ohio, in 2015, the bank told regulators in a letter that it was ""due to limited usage in a declining rural area."" In a letter to customers, PNC wrote that consumers were ""using branches very differently today"" and that they have ""more service choices than ever."" While Jeromesville has no remaining bank branches, it does still have a PNC ATM.

""Limited usage is one of many criteria we look at when making the difficult but necessary decision to close a branch,"" PNC said. ""Other criteria include community needs and the closest nearby branch."" PNC has a branch roughly 8 miles from Jeromesville.

Some customers miss their branches. Bubba McKey, who runs a grocery store in Centreville, Miss., population 1,667, banked at the only Regions branch there for years until Regions closed it in 2016. He has since switched most of his banking to the only other bank in town, a community lender called United Mississippi Bank, but he can no longer walk just a few blocks to get change for his store or deposit checks. ""I have no qualms with the other bank,"" Mr. McKey said. ""It's mostly just the fact that you don't have a choice now.""

Charlene LeBlanc decided to keep banking at Regions, but she has to drive more than 30 miles to a Louisiana branch to cash checks. She has used Regions' mobile app to deposit checks, but says she doesn't like it. The old Regions branch still sits vacant.

""We understand that closing branches can create difficulties for our customers in smaller communities,"" a Regions spokeswoman said, adding that the bank tries to limit the impact of closings. For example, it has donated branch buildings to a credit union with locations throughout Mississippi.

When SunTrust pulled out of Muscle Shoals, Ala., last year it left a different mark: its furniture, which it bundled onto the side of the road. Employees at a business down the street, Alabama Hose Products, got new filing cabinets. A SunTrust spokeswoman declined to comment about the branch strategy but said that when the bank closes a branch, excess furniture is typically disposed of at the end of the day."
Ctit Group,Card Issuers Put Kibosh on Bitcoin," Feb 5, 2018",0,"More credit-card issuers are ditching bitcoin.

Three of the largest U.S. banks said Friday that they would no longer permit credit-card customers to buy bitcoin with their credit cards.

The decisions were announced after a brutal week for bitcoin prices, which have plummeted more than 50% from their peak in December.

Citigroup Inc. said that it has decided to no longer permit its credit-card customers to buy bitcoin with their Citi credit cards. The bank is in the process of implementing the block, which will apply to Citi credit-card holders globally. ""We will continue to review our policy as this market evolves,"" said a bank spokeswoman.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. also said they won't allow credit-card customers to use credit cards to buy bitcoin.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Jan. 25 that banks were becoming concerned about the risks associated with credit cards being used to purchase bitcoin. Capital One Financial Corp. prohibited credit-card purchases of bitcoin in January, and Discover Financial Services banned them in 2015.

With the latest announcements, most top credit-card issuers by volume won't allow bitcoin purchases. One of the biggest concerns for banks is that bitcoin purchases will push up their card losses. That includes cardholders who don't pay their bills when the price of bitcoin falls below what they paid to buy it with the card.

Overall credit-card charge-offs are rising because of several factors, including looser underwriting standards in recent years. That has investors concerned because losses are up during a relatively strong economy with low unemployment."
Ctit Group,Fed Sends Message To Boards Via Wells," Feb 5, 2018",1,"The Federal Reserve's unprecedented move to handcuff growth at Wells Fargo & Co. sent a message that boards of directors, not just management, will be held accountable when big banks fail to manage risks.

The Fed on Friday said Wells Fargo would be replacing four board directors in 2018 and announced an enforcement action that limits the size of the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, potentially crimping revenue and profit growth.

While directed at Wells Fargo, which has struggled to overcome the sales-practices scandal that engulfed the bank in September 2016, the Fed's action has wider ramifications.

""The Fed just put the fear of God into bank boardrooms across the country,"" Ian Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha Partners, said in a note on Sunday. ""And that's exactly what it wants to do.""

The Fed, which cited ""widespread consumer abuses"" at Wells Fargo, has never before imposed such a broad restriction as part of an enforcement action. Wells Fargo is barred from growing past the $1.95 trillion in assets it had at the end of 2017, unless it gets regulators' permission. Fed officials did say the company can continue to lend and take deposits.

Wells Fargo said it was ""confident it will satisfy the requirements of the consent order.""

Chief Executive Officer Timothy Sloan, also a director, said on a call with analysts Friday evening that the bank within 60 days will submit plans to the Fed ""that leverage existing plans and efforts already under way to further enhance the board's effectiveness in carrying out its oversight and governance of the company and further improve the firm-wide compliance and operational risk management program.""

A letter Friday from departing Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), showed that the central bank is thinking more broadly than just Wells Fargo. Ms. Yellen wrote that the Fed is raising expectations for boards across the banking industry.

The letter cited guidance for boards the Fed proposed in August, which Mrs. Yellen wrote ""marks the first time that the Federal Reserve has issued stand-alone expectations for boards of directors as distinct from management.""

""That distinction allows us to spotlight the core responsibilities of effective boards, one of which is to ensure the independence and stature of the risk management and internal audit function,"" the letter said.

Ms. Yellen handed over leadership of the central bank this weekend to Jerome Powell. He was appointed by President Donald Trump, who has pushed a deregulatory agenda for banks and other industries.

But banks shouldn't necessarily think Mr. Powell will change course. As a Fed governor, he took a leading role in pushing the Fed to adopt the new regulatory guidance for board members.

""Across a range of responsibilities, we simply expect much more of boards of directors than ever before,"" Mr. Powell said in an August 2017 speech, the month the draft guidance was published. ""There is no reason to expect that to change.""

The Fed guidance, which applies to all banks, seeks to reduce the number of regulatory requirements for which boards are directly accountable. Fed officials said the goal wasn't to make boards' lives easier but to push the board to focus on big-picture issues, such as firmwide risk management.

The restriction on Wells Fargo's asset growth also took the Fed into uncharted territory, and the harsh penalty reflected a judgment that the bank's board failed to ensure ""that senior management had established and maintained an adequate risk management framework commensurate with the size and complexity of the firm,"" as the Fed's enforcement order put it.

During the financial crisis, the Fed and other banking regulators indirectly pushed banks to add directors with more financial experience.

Wells Fargo had been an outlier in recent years among big banks, expanding its footprint when peers such as Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. were largely retrenching as they recovered from the 2008 financial crisis.

More recently, as the bank's problems in different corners of the firm unfolded, Fed officials concluded Wells Fargo had grown and taken on more risk, without adequately updating its ability to manage that risk. The firm's problems were so broad that officials decided a broad punishment was warranted.

In September 2016, the bank settled allegations that it had engaged in years of improper sales practices that resulted in potentially 3.5 million accounts being opened without customers' knowledge. Elsewhere, more than 550,000 auto-loan and mortgage customers were possibly overcharged for products for years as well."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Fund Starts 2018 With a Bang," Feb 3, 2018",0,"A new hedge fund run by Brevan Howard Asset Management LLP star trader Alfredo Saitta has chalked up one of the industry's best performances in the first part of this year, as the fund giant battles to rebuild its business.

The $500 million AS Macro fund, run by the former JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. trader, gained 6.7% through Jan. 26, according to an investor letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Macro funds, which trade global bonds, currencies and stocks, returned 3.8% on average for all of January, according to data group HFR.

Brevan's flagship $5.3 billion Master hedge fund, one of the industry's best-known funds, hasn't scored a gain as big as the AS fund's in a single month in about a decade.

The AS fund, whose investors include Brevan co-founder Alan Howard, made almost half of its gain in the week ended Jan. 26, according to numbers sent to investors. The firm, among the most secretive in the industry in not revealing its market positions, didn't disclose what had driven the gains. A Brevan spokesman declined to comment.

Having struggled for years as vast amounts of central-bank liquidity have dominated market moves, macro funds are suddenly profiting this year from a sharp pickup in Treasury yields, a stronger euro and rising stocks, industry executives say.

Among other funds to report strong numbers in 2018 is Greenwich, Conn.-based Tudor Investment Corp., founded by Paul Tudor Jones, which has gained 4.5% in its Global fund through late January, according to a person familiar with the matter. New York-based Caxton Associates LP gained 5.3% to Jan. 29, according to an investor, making money in a range of assets.

R.G. Niederhoffer Capital Management Inc.'s Diversified fund, a computer-driven fund that trades market patterns, rose 16.2% last month, the firm said. The fund profited particularly from stocks, as well as from currencies, fixed income and commodities.

The S&P 500 rose 5.6% during January. Macro funds tend to invest in a range of assets in addition to stocks. Overall, all types of hedge funds rose 2.45% last month, according to data group HFR.

The performance of Mr. Saitta's fund marks a rare piece of good news for Brevan.

The firm's flagship Master fund, once considered the industry's gold standard, lost money in three of the past four calendar years and has shrunk from around $27 billion to $5.3 billion over the past four years as clients have withdrawn their money.

In September, The Wall Street Journal reported that Brevan was planning to inject $300 million to $400 million into Mr. Saitta's fund to help it get up and running. The fund opened up to external investors in November."
Ctit Group,Bitcoin Selloff Picks Up The Pace," Feb 3, 2018",0,"Bitcoin plunged below $8,000 in intraday trading, extending its sharp rout since the start of the year in a selloff triggered by a widening regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrencies.

Late Friday in New York, bitcoin had recovered to $8,524, down 6.8% on the day after slipping below $7,700. That was the lowest level since November.

At its low point, the digital currency had fallen about 60% from an intraday record of $19,783 in December, according to research site CoinDesk Inc. That marks bitcoin's third biggest drop over the past five years. It fell 76% in the spring of 2013 and 85% from November 2013 to January 2015.

Bitcoin's sharp swings illustrate just how much the digital currency remains a highly illiquid and volatile investment, particularly relative to stock, bond or currency markets.

In its nine-year history, it has had five peak-to-trough declines of more than 70% apiece, said Charlie Bilello, director of research at New York advisory firm Pension Partners. It fell 94% in less than a month in 2010 -- and again over a five-month stretch in 2011 -- but both times bounced back.

The recent decline in some regards feels more severe, as the magnitude of the price drop offers a dose of reality to new investors who poured money into cryptocurrencies during last year's rally. Many were drawn to the prospect of investing in currencies outside the control of central banks and governments, but now are having to succumb to market forces.

""Headlines for crypto have been mostly negative lately,"" Thomas Lee, managing partner at New York-based Fundstrat Global Advisors, wrote in a note to clients. ""It has been a terrible few weeks, but the fundamental positive story for crypto remains intact,"" Mr. Lee added, referring to strong millennial interest in cryptocurrencies.

Robinhood, an online trading app that targets young people, this past week said more than one million people joined its wait list to trade cryptocurrencies after it announced plans to offer crypto trading services.

Meanwhile, some big banks are putting up roadblocks to buying bitcoin. JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. said Friday that they no longer would allow credit-card holders to use the cards to buy bitcoin.

Regulatory scrutiny is behind much of the reason for bitcoin's sudden fall. India is the latest country to crack down on the cryptocurrency market, following in the footsteps of China and South Korea. That pressure shows that governments are turning out to be much harder to circumvent than cryptocurrency advocates once thought.

Bitcoin fell 28% in January, its steepest monthly decline in three years.

In the bitcoin futures market, in which traders can bet on the ups or downs in the digital currency, hedge funds have shifted their positioning so bearish bets outnumber bullish ones by more than 3 to 1, according to data released Friday by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. A week earlier, hedge funds had been biased toward the bullish side, the CFTC data show.

The current mood is a far cry from the end of last year, when cryptocurrency investment mania hit feverish levels. A popular bitcoin-services company called Coinbase briefly drew some 100,000 new customers a day around Thanksgiving, as bitcoin approached $10,000, up from under $1,000 at the start of 2017.

Prices more than doubled from there, peaking at $19,783.21 on Dec. 17. Then came a six-week slide.

Alex Beene, a 30-year-old from Nashville, Tenn., cashed out as the decline accelerated. He said he recently sold all his bitcoin, locking in a profit of over $60,000.

Mr. Beene, who writes children's books and works in the Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development, said he bought most of his bitcoin in September, before prices surged over 500% in the following months.

""You'd wake up to $5,000 to $10,000 gains on consecutive mornings,"" he said. ""It was like a money train that wouldn't end, but you could tell [it] wasn't going to last.""

It didn't.

Mr. Beene did keep some litecoin -- an alternative digital currency -- in his portfolio. The price of litecoin is down more than 60% from a high in December, according to research site CoinMarketCap.

He called the weekslong selloff ""a scary scenario.""

Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said Thursday that the government doesn't recognize digital money as legal tender and would ""take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system.""

Vaibhav Parikh, partner at Indian law firm Nishith Desai Associates, said some people might have misinterpreted, wrongly concluding the government was banning bitcoin.

""The Indian government said it will only crack down on the use of bitcoin for illegal activities and not on the currency itself,"" he said.

Other governments, particularly in Asia, have taken stringent approaches to cryptocurrency.

South Korea is implementing new legislation aimed at cooling its red-hot bitcoin market. China has gone even further, ordering cryptocurrency exchanges to close and moving toward limiting bitcoin mining operations, in which new bitcoin are minted.

In Japan, $530 million of a cryptocurrency called NEM was swiped in a heist on the exchange Coincheck Inc.

In the U.S., regulators have warned of fraud in initial coin offerings, a new form of fundraising by which a company creates a new virtual coin or token and offers it for public sale. The offerings have attracted billions of dollars.

Even Facebook Inc. is cracking down. The social-media company said this past week that it would stop running ads promoting cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings.

""I don't think this is the end of the line for cryptos, but I'm certainly not touching any until more stability can be reached,"" Mr. Beene said."
Ctit Group,Oil Falls Back Under the Dollar's Influence," Feb 3, 2018",1,"Oil prices are no longer trading in their own world.

After months of taking direction from information on global supply and demand, crude markets are falling back into step with broader markets, taking cues over the past two weeks from fluctuations in the U.S. dollar.

Earlier this past week, oil hovered near a three-year high, as the dollar fell to the lowest level in more than three years. But on Friday, a rebound in the dollar dragged down crude prices.

The reversal occurred as stocks, bonds and other commodities also retreated. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 665.75 points Friday, closing out its biggest one-week percentage decline since January 2016 with a 4.1% drop. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose to the highest level in more than four years.

""The stock market and interest rates can really affect oil a lot,"" said Mark Waggoner, president of Excel Futures. ""It's spilling over into the energy markets and causing these ripple effects.""

Volatility picked up across markets Friday after the Labor Department said the U.S. economy added 200,000 jobs in January, beating economists' expectations. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate stayed at a 17-year low and wage growth accelerated, stoking concerns about higher interest rates.

That sent the WSJ Dollar Index higher. The gauge, which tracks the dollar against a basket of 16 currencies, rose 0.7% to 83.58.

Light, sweet crude for April delivery settled down 35 cents, or 0.5%, to $65.45 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and traded as low as $64.47 during the session. Brent, the global benchmark, declined $1.07, or 1.5%, to $68.58 a barrel.

Other commodities such as gold and copper settled lower Friday as well.

Commodities such as oil, which are priced in dollars, become more expensive to buyers using other currencies when the U.S. unit strengthens. Analysts at Capital Economics attribute half of the surge in oil prices since the beginning of December to a weaker U.S. dollar, the research firm said in a Friday report.

""The dollar is the talk today,"" said Ric Navy, vice president for energy futures at R.J. O'Brien & Associates LLC. ""You've had more attachment to it recently.""

Energy companies led stocks lower Friday, as the S&P 500 energy sector fell more than 4%, wiping out nearly all of its year-to-date gains that had resulted from a rebound in crude prices.

Chevron Corp. and Exxon Mobil Corp. shares both fell more than 5% after reporting quarterly profits that missed analysts' expectations, the biggest one-day loss for both companies since 2011.

""Some of the selloff in energy is being compounded by the broader market weakness,"" said Chris Kettenmann, chief energy strategist at New York-based Macro Risk Advisors. ""What's really coming to the surface is how much stocks are down.""

The correlation between oil and the stock market has become more pronounced in recent days.

""The potential is present for a big move lower should fear return to the stock market and spark liquidations across the board,"" analysts at TAC Energy said Friday. ""The cross-asset class correlations have returned over the past several weeks.""

But supply could rear its head again, meaning oil prices would revert back to trading based on dynamics that are more closely tied to the energy market.

Ed Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup, said investors have been ignoring the risk that U.S. shale producers will flood the market with oil once again.

Shale companies spent the past three years becoming leaner and wringing costs out of their operations and can now comfortably make money at these prices, so investors banking on companies to show greater discipline could be in for a disappointment.

""The animal spirits that drive these companies overshadow any commitment to having discipline,"" Mr. Morse said. ""Only the most naive of analysts or investors actually believe that's going to happen.""

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, U.S. oil production exceeded 10 million barrels a day in November for the first time in nearly 50 years. On a weekly basis, domestic production rose to a fresh record for the week ended Jan. 26 of more than 9.9 million barrels a day, government data show.

""2018 could turn out to look a lot like 2014 -- a year that started with very high prices and ended at very low prices,"" Mr. Morse said."

Portfolio Values Rise,

As Both Top S&P

Private-equity firms Blackstone Group LP and Apollo Global Management LLC reported improved quarterly results and offered a window into how private-equity firms are digesting the new tax law.

Both said Thursday that the legislation Congress passed late last year largely benefits the companies they own, and they reported significant increases in the values of their private-equity portfolios.

Blackstone and Apollo stopped short of saying tax changes would prompt them to alter their partnership structure, a more drastic step some analysts were expecting.

The value of Blackstone's private-equity portfolio climbed 6.8% in the quarter, while Apollo's rose 9.1%. Both outpaced the 6.1% gain in the S&P 500.

""The tax reform act was positive overall for our portfolio,"" said Apollo co-founder Joshua Harris.

MASTERCARD, Visa

Revenue Increases

At Both Card Firms

Mastercard Inc. beat revenue expectations in its latest quarter due to strong cardholder spending, but its profit took a hit as it implemented U.S. tax law changes.

Mastercard's fourth-quarter revenue rose 20% from the year before to $3.31 billion, more than the $3.26 billion analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected.

Mastercard's profit dropped to $227 million, or 21 cents a share, from $933 million, or 86 cents a share, the year before.

Meanwhile, a rise in card spending by increasingly confident consumers helped Visa Inc. beat revenue expectations for its fiscal first quarter. Revenue in the quarter ended Dec. 31 rose 9% from the year before to $4.86 billion, above analysts' expectations.

Profit rose to $2.52 billion, or $1.07 a share, from $2.07 billion, or 86 cents.

DEUTSCHE BANK

CFTC Penalizes

Securities Unit

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission fined Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. $70 million as regulators continue to punish attempted manipulation of interest-rate benchmarks during the financial crisis era.

According to the CFTC's order, Deutsche Bank ""made false reports and through the acts of multiple traders"" deliberately and repeatedly attempted to manipulate common global interest rate products between 2007-2012. Four other banks have settled similar cases for larger amounts of money: Barclays PLC, Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Royal Bank of Scotland.

""We have cooperated extensively with the CFTC's investigation and have undertaken significant efforts to remediate benchmark-related activities,"" a Deutsche Bank spokesman said.

The CFTC recognized Deutsche Bank's cooperation in the investigation."
Ctit Group,Tesla Finds Strong Demand for Sale of $546 Million in Debt," Feb 2, 2018",1,"Tesla Inc. sold $546 million of bonds backed by lease payments on Model X and Model S vehicles on Thursday, the latest sign of how yield-hungry investors continue to soak up corporate debt of all flavors.

The electric-car company's inaugural visit to the asset-backed-securities market came roughly six months after it sold traditional corporate bonds for the first time. Once again, Tesla found eager buyers, allowing it cut interest rates on the multi-part deal from the levels initially floated to investors.

Buyers are betting on continued strength in the auto leasing business, where securitization has picked up in recent years. Bondholders are repaid from lease payments on the Tesla vehicles, as well as the resale value of the cars once those leases are up.

While that insulates investors from some of the challenges facing Tesla at the moment, it still exposes them to the risk those cars can't be resold for as much as expected, analysts say. Battery-powered vehicles don't have as long a track record for resale value as traditional vehicles whose leases are commonly securitized. Investors could take losses if resale values are substantially below expectations or if the economy turns south, causing a selloff across asset classes.

But with rates still low by historical standards and the economy humming along at the moment, investors continue to dig into esoteric corners of the bond market.

Tesla's largest tranche sold Thursday, a $422.6 million slice of debt assigned the highest possible credit rating by Moody's Investors Service, came with a 0.3 percentage point yield premium, or spread, above the benchmark swap rate, down from earlier guidance of around 0.4-0.43 percentage point. The lowest-rated slice sold at a 2.65 percentage points yield premium, down from around 2.8-2.9 percentage points.

Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG were lead underwriters on the deal."
Ctit Group,"In Italy, Markets Flash Buy Signal --- Economy hums along and stocks and bonds rally, while concerns ease over March vote"," Feb 1, 2018",1,"Last year, the coming Italian election in March was seen by some as having the potential to split apart the eurozone.

Now, with just five weeks to go, not so much.

Many Italian assets have rallied and outperformed European peers, thanks in part to the country's expanding economy and shrinking unemployment rate. In addition, the perceived threat from antiestablishment politicians has eased. All of which has appeared to soothe investor concerns as the vote approaches, a trend that isn't uncommon to elections in the country.

""Every time you have an election in Italy, people say, 'Whoa, there's a lot of political instability,' but every time it's a nonevent,"" said Marie-Anne Allier, head of euro fixed income at Amundi SA, a large European fund-management firm.

In late 2016, concern that Italians would reject constitutional overhauls in a referendum provoked widespread concern. Voters did reject it, but the selloff that followed was short-lived.

""Everyone who sells Italy because of an Italian election loses money,"" she said.

This year, Italy's flagship stock index is up 7.5%, compared with 3.3% for the EuroStoxx index of eurozone shares. That puts the FTSE MIB ahead of its peers in Germany, France and Spain.

And while Italy's recovery has been slow by the standards of its eurozone peers, the latest gross-domestic-product data showed a 1.7% expansion in the year to September 2017, the fastest rise since 2011. Unemployment, at 10.8%, has now declined to its lowest level since 2012. Italian banks have made attempts to clean up balance sheets weighed down by bad loans, and recapitalizations and liquidations have helped to lift the sector.

""Accelerating GDP growth, rising sentiment, reducing banking risks and a positive rating cycle currently overshadow still-elevated Italian political risks,"" said Giada Giani, an economist at Citigroup Inc. in a recent research note.

To be sure, many analysts and investors see longer-term risks in the Italian economy. Growth is still slow and with the country's stock of nonperforming loans still high, the banking system is weaker than most other parts of Europe.

Also, Italy's comparatively lukewarm support for the euro, which fanned investors' concerns last year, hasn't gotten any better.

Only 59% of Italians say they are in favor of a single European currency, according to European Commission survey data, below Germany's 81%, France's 71% or even Greece's 66%.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. believes that assets could still move to account for the risks surrounding the election in the weeks to come.

""It seems to us that the market is complacent,"" Silvia Ardagna, an economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a recent research note. Ms. Ardagna said most market moves ahead of European elections often come during the last two to three weeks of the campaign.

The spread between Italian and German sovereign-bond yields -- an indicator of the additional default risk associated with Rome -- has declined in the new year.

Italy's 10-year bonds offer a yield 1.4 percentage points higher than Germany's, roughly the lowest level in a year. As recently as April 2017, those yields were 2.1 percentage points higher.

Despite the gains, investors like Amundi's Ms. Allier still see value in the country's government debt. Italy's 10-year government bonds offer a yield of about 2%, while French and German equivalents offer less than 1%.

Aside from bright economics, concerns over Italian political risk have also faded as the populist parties that prompted it take a softer line."
Ctit Group,Easy-Money Decade Upends Bond Market," Jan 31, 2018",1,"A hydroelectric dam in Tajikistan, the government of Portugal and a cruise-ship operator last fall all issued debt at unusually low interest rates, part of a proliferation of aggressive bond sales influenced by a decade of loose monetary policy and a demographic shift in global investing.

Historical limits on who can borrow, and at what cost, have broken down as fund managers agree to previously unpalatable terms. Central bankers in the U.S., Europe and Japan helped shape the new breed of deals by simultaneously purchasing more than $1 trillion in high-quality bonds since 2009 and lowering benchmark interest rates to jump-start their faltering economies.

Modest economic growth came, but the strategy crowded private investors out of safe debt, prompting them to buy riskier bonds to boost returns.

Retiring baby boomers amplified the trend by moving their investments from stocks into bonds, increasing assets in U.S. bond mutual funds to $4.6 trillion in November from $1.5 trillion a decade earlier, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade group for investment firms.

""A lot of smart people say we're in a bubble, and their fingers are pointed at credit,"" said Steven Shenfeld, president of MidOcean Credit Partners, an investment firm focused on high-yield debt. MidOcean is preparing for the expected downturn in certain portfolios by placing bets that will pay out if bond prices sell off, he said. ""I'm just an old trader that's seen this movie too many times.""

U.S. bond yields ticked up this year but remain below historical averages, and investors keep buying below-investment-grade bonds, squeezing the risk premium junk bonds pay over Treasurys to a 10-year low. Some central banks are reeling back quantitative easing to keep economies and markets from overheating. An anecdotal gauge of five key markets -- emerging markets, municipal bonds, government debt, securitizations and corporate loans -- shows temperatures are plenty hot already.

Here are some tales from the bleeding edge of credit:

TAJIKISTAN: The country is ranked as one of the world's most corrupt nations by Transparency International. When the country sold its first international bond in September, offering documents warned that ""corruption, and allegations of corruption, in Tajikistan may have a negative impact on Tajikistan's economy.""

So many investors wanted a piece of the $500 million deal that Tajikistan was able to negotiate a significant reduction in the interest rate of the bond.

Cash raised in the sale is earmarked to finish construction of the Rogun hydroelectric dam, begun in 1976 under the Soviet Union, and repayment of the debt is projected to come from electricity sales to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Conflict in Afghanistan ""could have a material adverse effect on Tajikistan's economy and its ability to make payments on the notes,"" the bond offering said.

Tajikistan's investment bank, Citigroup Inc., initially marketed the bond to yield 8% but received so much investor demand the clearing price was cut to 7.1%. The bonds still paid well above the 5.4% average yield for emerging-market debt in September, according to an index maintained by JPMorgan Chase & Co., making them attractive to yield-hungry bond funds. Buyers included large U.S. asset managers like Fidelity Investments, which purchased $14 million of these bonds for its mutual funds, regulatory filings show.

A spokesman for Citigroup declined to comment. Officials from Tajikistan's Ministry of Finance couldn't be reached for comment.

AMERICAN DREAM: Another languishing development, the American Dream Mall in East Rutherford, N.J., also got a jump-start from bond markets in 2017. The project, previously known as Xanadu, broke ground in 2003 but ran out of money to finish construction. The mall's current owner -- its third -- is betting that it can buck the trend of retail extinction spreading across the country.

Initial efforts to fund the mall-and-amusement-park-hybrid with real-estate loans foundered during the financial crisis. Canadian developer Triple Five took over the project in 2013 and announced plans to sell municipal bonds, but that stalled amid political opposition and pushback from skeptical investors.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sold the tax-exempt bonds in June at yields as high as 6.9%, depending heavily on one investor: John Miller, a portfolio manager at Nuveen Asset Management LLC, whose largest mutual fund has more than doubled in size since 2014 to about $17 billion. Mr. Miller bought half of the American Dream bonds, or about $570 million, because of the yield and because the project will flourish, he said. Unlike most malls, American Dream will derive much of its revenue from experiential attractions that can't be replicated online, rather than depending on retailers, he said.

PORTUGAL: On Nov. 8, Portugal auctioned 1.25 billion ($1.55 billion) of 10-year bonds to yield 1.94% -- the lowest rate ever for the country. Portugal needed an international bailout in 2011 and still has a junk credit rating. Investors placed bids for about 2 billion euros of bonds, far exceeding the amount on offer.

Portugal remains one of the most heavily indebted countries in Europe, but the auction set its borrowing cost below that of the U.S. government, which sold 10-year bonds in November to yield 2.31%. The U.S., with among the highest credit ratings, is viewed as one of the safest borrowers on the planet.

The mismatch is an unintended consequence of the European Central Bank's use of low interest rates and bond purchases to revive economic activity. The policy resulted in negative bond yields in the eurozone's strongest economies like France and Germany, forcing bond funds to buy more in riskier countries like Portugal to deliver positive returns.

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES: These three words are redolent of the risk taking, financial alchemy and hubris that fed the credit crisis. Mortgage-backed bonds were the most infamous ABS, but investment banks innovated far stranger types, including airplane-backed bonds, bonds backed by royalties owed to David Bowie and, in 2007, a $100 million bond backed by the inventory of Antwerp, Belgium-based diamond dealer Diarough.

Like many precrisis ABS, repayment of the diamond bonds was predicated on refinancing, and after the securitization market dried up, Diarough restructured the debt instead. The gem merchant cut the interest it paid bondholders and extended the due date of the bonds, according to a report by Moody's Investors Service.

By 2017, the esoteric ABS market was showing signs of life again, and Diarough returned with a $150 million deal in August. Bond funds, flush with cash from yield-hungry investors, flocked to the new bonds, warranting an increase to $155 million. The Pioneer Bond Fund, which has about doubled in size since 2015 to $5 billion, bought $4.2 million of the Diarough bond, according to a regulatory filing.

Gert Ovart, a finance manager at Diarough, declined to comment. Officials at Pioneer couldn't be reached.

NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINES: Executives of Miami-based Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings gathered in October to toast an unexpected accomplishment with Veuve Clicquot Champagne. They had negotiated a $375 million bank loan for the company at an interest rate of about 3%, the lowest in its 55-year history.

It is also one of the lowest yields ever achieved by any borrower in the leveraged-loan market for companies with below-investment-grade credit ratings.

The force driving the race to the bottom in leveraged loan rates is the same one causing the feeding frenzy in other credit markets: Investors reaching further for yield in response to central-bank policy. With most triple-A Treasury bonds paying negligible yields, banks and insurers from Tokyo to New York are buying more investment-grade corporate and securitized bonds to boost returns.

That has benefited managers of collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, who issue triple-A bonds and use the borrowed money to buy up bundles of leveraged loans like those borrowed by NCL. No surprise, CLO issuance boomed in 2017, boosting demand for corporate loans and giving NCL unprecedented pricing power and a new reason to break out the champagne."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Bankers at Davos Talk Of Eerily Good Times --- Strength of corporate earnings helps fuel optimism; some worry about frothy markets," Jan 27, 2018",0,"DAVOS, Switzerland -- Bankers and executives at the World Economic Forum are celebrating a growing economy and rising markets. They see a continuing string of deals flowing their way, cost-saving new technology and a boost from U.S. tax cuts.

But underlying worries persist despite an upbeat economy in practically all corners of the world, said delegates on the sidelines of the event. Among them: The market's ascent has been eerily, steadily calm.

""It does feel to me a little bit like 2006,"" said Jes Staley, chief executive officer of British lender Barclays PLC. ""'Maybe we've solved the riddle of economic cycles' -- that's what we were all saying. We really got that wrong.""

One concern, Mr. Staley said, is that investors have become complacent with low market volatility. ""The system is geared. When there's a reversal, it could be fast.""

Investors' portfolios have chugged steadily higher in value.

""The whole world is going up in a straight line,"" said Michael Lavelle, who runs Citigroup Inc.'s investment bank in the U.K. ""But for how long?""

Mark Hantho, Deutsche Bank AG's chairman of global capital markets, said he sees the ratio of optimism versus caution this year at 70-30. ""Markets have run very quickly. People are asking, how can it be this good? What am I missing?""

But banking clients don't want to miss out on deals or securities issuance and regret that later, he said. ""There's a little bit of fear of being left behind.""

Some are roundly bullish. ""I've been coming since 2010. I've never seen a Davos more positive,"" said Manuel Falco, Citigroup's head of corporate and investment banking for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Behind the optimism is fundamental strength in corporate earnings, commodity prices and accommodative central bank policies, said James Amine, head of investment banking and capital markets at Credit Suisse Group AG.

""The market will dip. It won't be a straight line up through Dec. 31. I still feel good,"" said Mr. Amine. He added that days packed with Davos meetings bolstered his view that CEOs are more confident than they have been since 2006-2007.

""There's always things to worry about but not a lot until the middle of 2019,"" said Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO of asset and wealth management at JPMorgan Chase & Co.

She said Europe is one of the most attractive areas for investment, and ""there is an insatiable appetite for private equity right now.""

Artificial intelligence, blockchain and other developing technologies permeated Davos presentations, and also meetings among bankers and company executives. Technology is driving deals but also presents risks, they said.

European companies recognize they have lost the battle for the online consumer to big U.S. technology companies. ""Their attention is now turned to the business consumer,"" said Wolfgang Fink, co-head of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s German and Austrian business.

""There's an acute anxiety among European companies to protect their edge,"" Mr. Fink said. European companies are pausing in some cases when considering deals involving manufacturing technology and internet solutions.

Zurich Insurance Group Ltd. CEO Mario Greco said he doesn't see big financial risks in the system -- not in inflation nor rising rates. More likely threats are political, social or ecological, he said.

That is a change from last year, when concerns such as China's economy were pronounced. Cybersecurity ranks high among bankers as a potential cause for a market downturn.

Some big investors feel the froth has gone too far, even with still-low interest rates. Canada's PSP Investments, which manages 140 billion Canadian dollars (US$113 billion) in retirement assets, has shifted some money from stocks to fixed-income assets. They are ""the lesser of two evils,"" said CEO Andre Bourbonnais.

For banks, the mood is partially dulled by investment-banking businesses grappling with new competition, pressure on fees and other long-term declines.

The lack of volatility is hurting banks' trading operations, which make money by seizing on price swings in stocks, bonds and other assets. Trading revenues fell sharply in 2017 at big banks.

""From an economic standpoint, it is blue sky,"" said Andrea Orcel, who runs investment banking at UBS Group AG. ""From an asset-price standpoint, blue sky. But investors are not trading. There is no in-and-out.""

Merger and acquisition volume is running at a level well above the historical average. Cheap debt and sky-high stock prices give companies plenty of currency for deals.

With the U.S. tax changes, ""CEOs have high confidence in the economy to be more acquisitive,"" said Daniel Pinto, who runs JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank.

Blockchain and bitcoin have been topics in just about every Davos venue, including a prominent street-front meeting spot in town. Payments executives expressed optimism about the technology's prospects to reduce costs and transaction times.

But to some economists it looks a lot like a bubble. Robert Shiller, Yale University professor and economics Nobel Prize winner, said buyers who missed out on the housing and stock-market boom are flocking to bitcoin. They are drawn in by ""the existential meaninglessness of life when you're not invested in anything,"" he said."
Ctit Group,Banks Put Obstacles On Path To Bitcoin," Jan 26, 2018",0,"Some banks and credit-card companies have begun restricting customers' purchases of bitcoin, shutting down a popular way to buy the volatile digital currency.

This month, Capital One Financial Corp. decided it would no longer let its customers use credit cards it issues when buying bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies such as ether ""due to the limited mainstream acceptance and the elevated risks of fraud, loss and volatility."" The bank said it would ""regularly evaluate the decision as cryptocurrency markets evolve.""

The firm's decision followed Discover Financial Services' move in 2015 to effectively prohibit purchases of digital currencies with its cards.

Bank of America Corp. allows bitcoin purchases with the credit cards it issues. ""At this point there is nothing that would block a transaction, but we are carefully reviewing our policy,"" said a bank spokeswoman.

Citigroup Inc., which allows bitcoin purchases with its credit cards, is also reviewing its policy, according to a person familiar with the matter. TD Bank, the U.S. unit of Toronto-Dominion Bank, said that as a result of security measures some bitcoin transactions aren't being processed.

The moves could put a crimp in one way to buy bitcoin, which soared 1,375% last year and attracted widespread new interest before falling about 20% this year. Despite bitcoin's popularity, some card companies are expressing concerns about consumers using credit cards to buy the currency.

Funding investments with credit cards isn't usual in traditional markets. Among brokerage firms, Charles Schwab Corp. and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. don't allow it, and E*Trade Financial Corp. lists several funding methods it accepts on its website, but doesn't mention credit cards.

With bitcoin, some 18% of buyers funded purchases with a credit card, according to a survey released in December from lending marketplace LendEDU. Of those, 22% said they didn't pay off their credit-card balance after the purchase. Nearly 90% of that group expected to eventually pay off the balance using profits from the investment, the survey found.

Funding those investments with debt only adds to the risk of investing in bitcoin. The volatile asset could result in card holders being underwater before the bill comes due.

Investors need to cover what often are double-digit-percentage interest rates on credit cards if they don't pay the bill in full, in addition to fees on the bitcoin transactions. To offset those costs, borrowers need bitcoin to rise substantially in value. That can increase the chances of borrowers not paying credit-card bills if they owe more on the asset than it is worth."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: UBS Takes Loss On U.S. Tax Hit; Buyback Planned," Jan 23, 2018",1,"ZURICH -- UBS Group AG swung to a fourth-quarter loss, becoming the latest big bank to take a hit from the tax overhaul in the U.S.

The Swiss bank, which neverthless touted the plan's long-term benefits, also announced a series of changes on Monday, including its first share-repurchase program since the financial crisis, a higher dividend and changes to its wealth-management unit. It is combining the global and Americas wealth divisions that oversee a combined $2.3 trillion in client assets in a bid to cut costs and improve service.

UBS reported a net loss of 2.22 billion Swiss francs ($2.3 billion) for the quarter, compared with a profit of 636 million francs in the year-ago period. The loss was larger than a net loss of about 2.15 billion francs expected by analysts.

On Monday, UBS's shares rose 0.4%, to 19.40 francs, in Zurich.

The bank reported a roughly 2.9 billion franc write-down of deferred tax assets due to the tax overhaul. These are past credits and deductions that companies can use to offset future tax payments. The new U.S. corporate tax rate -- lowered to 21% from 35% -- makes these assets less valuable. UBS said that excluding these charges, net profit would have risen 26%.

Still, UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti said the legislation will have ""profound long-term implications"" by making the U.S. an ""attractive place to run businesses and attract businesses."" He acknowledged that the new corporate tax rate may be an advantage for some of his peers, noting that the new, lower U.S. tax rate isn't much different from the Swiss rate.

Last week, Citigroup Inc. said it took a $22 billion charge in the fourth quarter, mostly related to the effect of the tax changes on deferred tax assets.

UBS's Swiss rival, Credit Suisse Group AG, said in December that it would take a 2.3 billion franc charge related to the tax overhaul. It releases fourth-quarter earnings in February.

UBS also said that a separate component in the U.S. tax overhaul aimed at ensuring that banks pay a minimum level of taxes on transactions with affiliated foreign entities would add up to 60 million francs to its 2018 tax bill, though the bank is exploring ways to mitigate this hit.

For the full year, UBS reported net profit of 1.17 billion francs compared with 3.2 billion francs a year earlier.

UBS said it would launch a 2 billion franc share-buyback program over three years, beginning in March, with up to 550 million francs in buybacks this year. It said it would target annual growth in its dividend of mid-to-high single-digit percentages, while eliminating its previous guidance to return 50% of its net profit to shareholders.

UBS has in recent years shifted toward managing money for wealthy clients while streamlining its investment bank. In the past quarter, the bank's global wealth-management unit recorded an 18% increase in adjusted pretax profit to 1.03 billion francs, with 13.8 billion francs in net new money for the quarter.

The bank said its unified wealth-management businesses would be co-headed by Martin Blessing and Tom Naratil.

""It will mean improved efficiency, more sharing of best practices, greater returns on our investments and enhanced client service,"" Mr. Ermotti said."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: German Bank Sector Goes Against Flow --- Fragmented industry is seen as a 'pillar' of nation's economy as others consolidate," Jan 23, 2018",1,"FRANKFURT -- Ten years ago, David Zimmer quit his management job to build his own fiber-optic network company in Germany. With 4 million euros ($4.9 million) in hand, he knocked at the door of about 20 banks for a 4 million euro loan.

Big banks, including Deutsche Bank AG and Commerzbank AG, didn't even reply to requests for a meeting, Mr. Zimmer says. In the end, his company, Inexio, got funding from two small lenders, a state-owned savings bank and a cooperative bank.

""If it weren't for the savings and cooperative banks, we wouldn't be here,"" said Mr. Zimmer, whose company now employs 300 people and has 65 million euros in annual revenue. ""And I suspect that is true for many [small and medium-size enterprises] in Germany.""

Germany may be the worst place in Europe to be a bank. With more than 1,600 banks, more than in the U.K., France, Italy and Spain combined, the sector is crowded and margins are low. Yet to many Germans, the copious credit this galaxy of banks makes available to businesses is a factor of their economy's success.

That has put German banks at the center of a Continent-wide question: What should European lenders look like?

Since the financial crisis that revealed bad lending practices and profitability troubles at many European banks, regulators have promoted consolidation. In Portugal, the European Central Bank supported takeovers by Spanish banks. In Italy, a law was passed to ease takeovers of small cooperative banks. And the European Union has pressed Berlin to cut down the number of lenders.

But Germans argue that their fragmented system turned out to be a boon during the financial crisis. State savings banks and cooperatives, which didn't hold risky securities, kept lending while commercial banks seized up. The model has since caught the attention of Ireland, where lawmakers are mulling the creation of state-owned savings banks.

""There is no question the fragmented nature and diversity of the German banking system is part of the success of the country's economy,"" said Patrick Rioual, head of German financial institutions ratings at Fitch Ratings. ""It fosters small companies' reliable and cheap access to credit, which supports their development.""

To be sure, Germany's banking model has had its share of trouble. The larger regional lenders made risky bets ahead of the 2007 crisis and some collapsed or had to be rescued as a result. The country's largest bank by assets, Deutsche Bank, overextended itself and was caught in scandals. And overcrowding means many lenders are struggling to survive in a low-interest-rate environment.

But in a country where 99.6% of all companies are small to medium size and businesses are scattered across the map, small lenders play an outsize role.

Germany's ""three-pillar"" banking system is split into about 200 commercial banks; 400 state-owned, local savings banks, including six larger regional lenders; and 970 cooperative banks owned by 18 million account holders, one in four Germans.

This is a highly fragmented, and moderately lucrative, market. Commercial banks hold just one-third of loans and deposits, according to Citigroup Inc., while the top five banks have a 30% market share, against a 60% average in Europe. Pretax profit margins at listed German banks were 16% of revenue in 2016, compared with 23% in France and 42% in the Netherlands.

""I learned in economics that a high level of competition is a good thing,"" said Sven Giegold, a German Green Party EU lawmaker based in Brussels, where Germans are lobbying to keep their system intact.

But competition in the German market doesn't extend everywhere. While the cooperative and savings banks compete with one another and with the commercial lenders, they enjoy exclusivity on their respective territorial patches.

And while they are run for profit, they stress their public-service role of serving the local economy.

""We still refuse to accept government aid, we don't chase after any stock-market trends, and always ask ourselves 'what do people need,' "" says a character dressed in 19th-century garb in a promotional video produced by the cooperative banking association.

There's some truth to that claim. While commercial banks froze lending during the financial crises of the past decade, cooperative and savings banks increased their exposure to German companies, according to central bank figures.

In Baden-Baden, a spa town in Germany's wealthy southwest, the local savings bank has a 40% market share and half its outstanding loans are to businesses, from automotive suppliers to health providers to hotels.

""We are happy to take on customers who initially require relatively small loans,"" said Lothar Volle, the lender's chief executive."
Ctit Group,January Proves Harsh Month for Treasurys --- Seasonal pattern shows government bond prices falling at beginning of year," Jan 22, 2018",0,"A Wall Street adage holds investors should sell stocks in May and go away to avoid a summer market slump. For bondholders, that month could be January.

Investors and analysts often expect Treasury yields, which rise as bond prices fall, to climb more in the first five months of the year than in the last seven.

It is a pattern that has held up often since 1998 -- a time in which bond yields have remained near modern lows -- with the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note posting an average increase of 0.017 percentage point in the months between January and May, versus a decline of 0.215 percentage point during the remainder of the year.

It is the type of seasonal pattern watched closely by some investors who use the market's perceived tendency toward higher yields in the first part of the year to guide their trading strategies. Others suggest such seasonal moves are akin to the correlation between stock returns and the price of butter in Bangladesh or which conference wins the Super Bowl: a coincidence in search of a causal link.

The debate holds particular significance now, after the yield on the 10-year Treasury last week hit its highest level since 2014.

That left many analysts questioning if the climb signaled further selling ahead -- as signs of a long-awaited pickup in growth relieve some of the anxiety pushing global investors into government debt -- or if the move marks the latest in a series of false starts that have characterized much of this long bull market.

""Oftentimes a technical phenomenon exists because everybody believes in it,"" said Michael Pond, head of global inflation-linked research at Barclays PLC. While some of the gains may reflect an element of a self-fulfilling prophecy, ""there's some real stuff that investors should take note of.""

One explanation for the pattern is that inflation tends to rise in the spring months as prices for a number of important components of the consumer-price index tend to rise, gasoline foremost among them but also airline fares, lodging, rents and apparel, according to Mr. Pond.

Inflation poses a threat to the value of government bonds because it chips away at the purchasing power of their fixed payments.

Other possible reasons include personal-income-tax season, which ends April 15 and often forces the government to increase its short-term borrowing to make refund payments, according to William O'Donnell, a strategist at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. Mr. O'Donnell also cites the repatriation of Japanese assets before the end of the country's fiscal year on March 31, which typically leads investors there to sell some Treasurys.

A 2015 paper by Mark Kamstra, Lisa Kramer and Maurice Levi even attributed a ""statistically and economically significant"" tendency for yields to rise early in the year to investors' seasonal depression.

In addition to those factors, this year also presents investors with ""a fundamental story about an improved global backdrop"" combined with the inflationary force of a weaker dollar and the stimulative effects of tax cuts, Mr. Pond said.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield ended 2017 at 2.409%, little changed from the end of 2016, as investors canceled bets on faster growth and inflation and as President Donald Trump struggled throughout the year to enact his legislative agenda.

Now, investors are reassessing the outlook for the economy following passage of a $1.5 trillion tax-cut bill that is expected to spur growth and lead to larger budget deficits. And after raising interest rates three times in 2017, the Federal Reserve has penciled in three more rate increases in 2018. Some firms, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., are forecasting four Fed rate increases as the tax cuts take effect.

The rise in yields this year are better explained by ""factors related to where we are in the economic cycle,"" said Jeffrey Klingelhofer, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. Seasonal patterns, if they exist, don't ""govern how we think about the world.""

Mr. Klingelhofer said he has been making trades intended to reduce his exposure to the risk of weakening credit quality and higher interest rates, such as selling longer-term, low-yielding company bonds and buying short-term floating-rate corporate and asset-backed debt.

The most potent factor pushing yields higher is likely to be global central banks, said Mr. Klingelhofer. The European Central Bank in January reduced its monthly bond purchases to 30 billion euros ($36.7 billion) from 60 billion euros, with authorization for the program expiring in September. The Bank of Japan has signaled that it will reduce its purchases of government bonds by 5%. The Bank of Canada raised interest rates Wednesday, and investors expect as many as three more rate increases this year.

In addition to its rate increases, the Fed is also scaling back on its reinvestment of maturing securities from its $4.2 trillion bond portfolio. Should Fed officials follow through on plans announced in September, that would produce a $30 billion reduction in monthly Fed Treasury reinvestments.

Economists in a Wall Street Journal survey are predicting the 10-year yield will rise to 2.74% by June 30 and 2.98% by year-end."
Ctit Group,Investors Are Banking on Reduced Taxes --- Optimism that lenders' stocks will rise further is fueled by forecasts of lower effective rates," Jan 19, 2018",0,"Now that big banks have finished reporting fourth-quarter earnings filled with noise from the new tax law, how much do they expect to actually pay in taxes going forward? A lot less than in the past.

That is just what investors were hoping to hear. In response, they have kept already buoyant big-bank stocks inching upward.

While some firms will pay higher rates than others, a number of big banks indicated they expect their effective tax rates would decline sharply to around 19% or 20% in 2018, as the corporate tax rate gets reduced. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. both said their tax rates would be around that level.

That is significant because financial companies have tended to pay taxes at higher rates than big companies in other industries, since so much of their business is centered in the U.S. Furthermore, some of the big banks, such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley, explicitly said they expect lighter tax bills to boost their earnings performance.

That is keeping investors optimistic despite some big short-term hits in fourth-quarter earnings that were related to the tax law.

Banks took charges as high as $22 billion, at Citigroup Inc., to reduce the value of their deferred-tax assets and account for a one-time tax on foreign earnings. Bank of America's charge was $2.9 billion; Goldman, $4.4 billion. On the other side, Wells Fargo had a gain of $3.35 billion, largely because the tax-rate reduction made its deferred-tax liabilities -- taxes it owed -- less onerous.

Investors looked through this noise, though, because it will give way to greater earnings power down the road as the corporate tax rate falls to 21% from 35%.

Financial shares surged in the wake of President Donald Trump's election. They foundered in mid-2017, as the new administration's legislative agenda stumbled. But in September, prospects for a tax-code overhaul brightened, and that marked a renewed upward turn for bank stocks.

Now that investors have a sense of how much banks' tax bills may fall, they are more confident about their earnings power going forward.

Bank of America said it expects its tax rate to be about 20% absent unusual items, compared with an expectation before the tax law was passed of about 29% for 2018. Its effective rate in 2016 was nearly 29%. (Banks said 2017 rates are skewed by one-time gains and losses related to the tax law.)

Assuming all of the benefits go to the bottom line, that would mean a boost of more than 1.5 percentage points to Bank of America's return on tangible common equity and more than 0.1 percentage point on its return on average assets, Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said on the bank's earnings call.

Morgan Stanley said it expects an effective tax rate of 22% to 25% in 2018, though it will have quarter-to-quarter volatility, compared with a nearly 31% rate in 2016. With more than two-thirds of the firm's pretax income coming from the U.S., ""we expect to see a meaningful reduction in our effective corporate tax rate,"" said CEO James Gorman on an earnings callThursday.

Goldman, meanwhile, expects the lower tax rate to have ""a direct effect"" in driving earnings growth and return on equity, Chief Financial Officer Martin Chavez said on a conference call Tuesday. Goldman expects its effective tax rate to decline to about 24% as a result of the new tax law, from a 2016 rate of 28.2%.

The prospect of higher returns on equity also has helped keep bank valuations inching higher. Price-to-book-value multiples for all the big banks, save Goldman, have risen over the past year. Bank of America and Citigroup were the primary gainers, rising 45% and 40%, respectively.

Citi has gotten a double boost in this regard. Even though it expects to have a higher rate than other big banks, its bottom line should still rise. And the bank slashed its deferred-tax assets by $19 billion. That lowers its book value, helping to boost itsmultiple.

But that isn't just a numbers game. Many investors were giving Citi scant credit for the value of its deferred-tax assets and adjusting their own view of its multiple accordingly. Now, its multiple is more reflective of the bank's balance sheet -- and this week Citi's market valuation climbed above its book value for the first time since September 2008."
Ctit Group,"Tax Law To Drive Savings, Buybacks"," Jan 18, 2018",1,"Some of the biggest U.S. companies are promising sizable annual savings, bigger pension contributions, higher dividend payments and more extensive stock buybacks as executives discuss the impact of the federal tax overhaul.

The announcements come as companies begin to report what are expected to be strong fourth-quarter financial results. A focus will be executives' expectations for how their operations and results this year will be affected by the tax law, which lowered the corporate rate to 21% from 35% and ended U.S. taxes on most future foreign income.

""The macro environment is as positive as we've seen in many years,"" Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Michael Corbat told investors Tuesday morning. ""Tax reform could change the sentiment among those making investment decisions from optimism to confidence and become the boost the U.S. economy needs to drive growth higher.""

UnitedHealth Group Inc. and FedEx Corp. have raised profit targets for 2018, citing the tax law. Companies including laboratory operator Quest Diagnostics Inc. have predicted sharply lower effective tax rates starting this year. For a few companies, including Citigroup and General Motors Co., the legislation will result in big accounting charges in the current quarter.

Overall, analysts expect S&P 500 companies to mark their sixth straight quarter of earnings and revenue growth. Profits are expected to jump 11.9% over the final quarter of 2016, while revenues are expected to rise 7%, according to Thomson Reuters.

Corporate profits have been powered by a healthy economic expansion, especially in the U.S. Low unemployment has spurred spending by consumers, and improving sentiment and demand have stirred business investment, economists say. A forecast from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta projects 3.3% growth in the gross domestic product for the fourth quarter, well above a postrecession pace of 2%.

It is a long way from the hopeful but anxious atmosphere that prevailed in boardrooms a year ago. Then, corporate chiefs lobbied Congress and President Donald Trump's fledgling administration seeking tax cuts, even as some expressed worries that the new president would disrupt global commerce with protectionist trade policies and roil labor markets by tightening immigration.

Executives of Delta Air Lines Inc. recently said they expect business and domestic travel will get a boost from the tax overhaul, in part as companies have more cash to invest in operations. ""We haven't seen that materialize yet, but we expect that to materialize in the first quarter,"" Delta President Glen Hauenstein told investors Thursday.

Veterinary drugmaker Zoetis Inc. said it expected its effective tax rate will fall to about 21% or 22% this year from 29% in 2017. Chief Financial Officer Glenn David said the tax overhaul doesn't change the company's priorities, which are reinvesting in the business, pursuing acquisitions and returning capital to investors, in that order.

""But with tax reform, with greater access to cash world-wide, it does give us greater flexibility,"" Mr. David said.

Even where executives see momentary risks, they say the broader picture remains rosy. Executives at bank holding company Comerica Inc. said Tuesday that lending could slow for a time as the tax overhaul leaves customers with more cash.

""Short term, it could have an impact in terms of lessening the borrowing need,"" Curtis Farmer, the bank's president, told investors. ""But longer term, I think it's very positive for the economy.""

So far, companies have been circumspect about their plans for the savings -- and for how they plan to use more than $1.5 trillion in foreign profits sequestered outside the U.S. that the law makes more accessible domestically.

Drugmaker AbbVie Inc. had accumulated about $29 billion in such profit outside the U.S. as of the end of 2016, its securities filings show. Last week, AbbVie executives said they plan to improve employee benefits, contribute more to the company's pension plans and make bigger charitable contributions.

""This will provide increased flexibility for capital deployment, including incremental investments here in the U.S.,"" CEO Richard Gonzalez said. Still, the company expects to generate far more cash than it can use productively in the business, he added, calling it fair for investors to expect AbbVie to increase the pace at which it pays dividends and buys back shares."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Soured Loans Take Toll on Wall Street," Jan 18, 2018",0,"A loan to a South African businessman is turning into a billion-dollar blunder for Wall Street.

Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on Wednesday reported more than $400 million in combined losses and charges related to loans to the former chairman of scandal-ridden South African retailer Steinhoff International Holdings NV.

Combined with losses and charges already reported by Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., the total tab for Wall Street from this blown trade is now more than $1 billion. And that doesn't count foreign banks, which report quarterly results over the next few weeks. A group of banks in 2016 lent 1.6 billion euros ($1.96 billion) to Steinhoff's then-chairman, Christo Wiese, with his shares in the company serving as collateral.

Those shares collapsed in value this fall after the retailer, which owns Mattress Firm and the Sleepy's brand, disclosed accounting irregularities. The speed of the stock's decline -- the shares were valued at 120% of the loan on Dec. 5 and less than 24% two days later -- left banks few good options.

Some cut their losses, selling the underlying shares for pennies on the dollar. Others are still holding some shares, hoping for a recovery while setting aside a cushion for likely future losses.

Goldman booked its losses of about $130 million in its investing and lending segment, tipping year-over-year revenue there into negative territory."
Ctit Group,"Goldman's Trading Falters --- Hit by tax charge and fixed-income falloff, bank reports $1.93 billion quarterly loss"," Jan 18, 2018",1,"Debt traders at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. stumbled badly in the last quarter of 2017, generating just $1 billion of revenue. Back in 2009, they brought in that much every 10 days.

Reporting its fourth-quarter results Wednesday, Goldman said debt-trading revenue fell 50% -- the worst three-month showing since 2008 and the latest in a nearly unbroken chain of quarterly declines in the business.

The numbers reflect problems not unique to Goldman, whose struggles have been acute, but also a wider malaise that has settled over Wall Street's securities operations, once the source of fat profits.

The trouble isn't rogue traders or big bets gone bad, but shrinking demand from investors who, with little conviction about how to play the markets, simply sit it out or opt for cheap, off-the-shelf investment products, such as index funds.

Meanwhile, new regulations have cast banks as mere toll-takers, and more transparent and accessible data have eroded the informational edge that once gave them pricing power over their clients.

The biggest quakes have hit banks' fixed-income divisions, diverse operations that trade everything from sovereign debt to precious metals to products tied to global interest rates.

Fixed-income revenue last year at the four biggest U.S. trading banks -- Goldman, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup and Bank of America Corp. -- fell between 6% and 30% from 2016, and remains orders of magnitude below the peak years of the pre-financial-crisis boom.

Goldman's trading decline sent the company's stock down 1.8% Wednesday and ratcheted up pressure on Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein to fix the business that vaulted him to the top of the firm. Mr. Blankfein, a former gold salesman, rose through Goldman's fixed-income trading division before being named CEO.

For 2017 as a whole, Goldman's revenue from its fixed-income business of $5.3 billion was little more than a fifth of what it was in 2009.

And, for the first time on record, Goldman's investment bankers, who broker mergers and underwrite securities offerings, outearned the firm's fixed-income traders.

Goldman's traders struggled all of last year, losing money on oil and gas trades as well as holdings of low-rated corporate debt. Nothing clicked in the most-recent quarter, when a continued lack of volatility kept clients on the sidelines. Goldman cited declines in all four of its main fixed-income businesses, which include credit, currencies, commodities and interest rates.

Goldman executives have said they were too slow to recognize that the effects of the financial crisis would linger as long as they have.

Over the past two years, the firm has cut traders, trimmed bonuses, revamped its sales network and embraced the type of low-margin, high-volume trades it once deemed too trivial to bother with.

1Another objective is to win more trading business from corporate clients that already hire Goldman for boardroom advice but use rivals to manage their market risks. Goldman itself has recognized that for too long it has relied on trading revenue from hedge funds, whose trading business is lucrative but runs hot and cold, and too little on companies and large asset managers, which have more predictable, simpler needs.

""We absolutely acknowledge that the business footprint and mix we have is a consequence of choices that we made over time,"" Chief Financial Officer Martin Chavez said on an analyst call Wednesday. ""We know that we need to do better."" He said it would take ""an order of months"" to see changes produce new profits.

Yet some tweaks, such as a 2015 reorganization of the firm's corporate sales force, have been in place for longer, with little to show.

""It just seems like progress should have been a lot faster than it's been,"" Mike Mayo, a Wells Fargo analyst, said Wednesday.

The most recent poor quarter is likely to intensify calls for more dramatic changes, including a shake-up of its broader trading division's leadership. That idea has gained steam among top Goldman executives in recent months, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Overall, Goldman's quarterly earnings, like those of other big banks, were muddied by the new tax law. A $4.4 billion one-time charge wiped out the company's entire quarterly profit, producing its first loss since 2011 of $1.93 billion. Without the charge, Goldman's net income would have exceeded analyst expectations.

But Goldman disappointed investors by saying it would dial back its stock-buyback plans to plow earnings instead into areas where it thinks it can grow.

Those include steadier businesses such as consumer banking and money management.

Both gained ground in 2017, helping to boost Goldman's full-year revenue 5%, the best showing among big banks so far. Asset management added $42 billion in long-term money at a time when investors are fleeing actively managed funds, and Goldman's fledgling consumer-lending effort wrote $2 billion in fresh loans. But those efforts will take years to fill the roughly $15 billion revenue hole opened by Goldman's trading woes -- if they ever do.

For the lack of noticeable progress in Goldman's trading turnaround, another firmwide effort is bearing fruit. A few years ago, executives decided to make a play for debt-underwriting business. That business historically has been dominated by big commercial banks, which can write large checks and tap trillions of dollars in low-cost deposits to fund them.

Debt-underwriting revenue hit a record $2.5 billion for the year and in the fourth quarter surpassed that of JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup. Goldman has made inroads on the back of its merger bankers, who are more often offering debt, in addition to advice, when putting together deals."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: U.S. Bancorp's Net Climbs 13%," Jan 18, 2018",0,"U.S. Bancorp, the biggest regional bank in the country, said the new tax law helped boost fourth-quarter earnings.

The bank also disclosed that it had set aside money for a potential settlement related to its anti-money-laundering program.

Profit at the Minneapolis-based bank rose 13% to $1.69 billion, or 97 cents a share, from $1.49 billion, or 82 cents, a year earlier.

On an adjusted basis, which strips out the tax-related gain and the legal accruals, earnings were 88 cents a share. That beat the 87 cents expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. However, shares closed down 1.45% at $56.34 on a day when the market climbed.

One development that seemed to rankle investors: U.S. Bank executives said in a call with analysts that they expected to reinvest about 25% of the bank's tax savings in business initiatives such as technology, automation and higher wages for entry-level employees.

They didn't specify how much of the tax savings they expected to return to shareholders.

Chief Financial Officer Terry Dolan said in an interview that he expected long-term shareholders to view the bank's spending as a favorable development that would eventually build profits. It is the short-term investors, he said, who were selling the shares Wednesday. ""We're thinking longer term about the changes that are impacting the banking business,"" Mr. Dolan said.

Mr. Dolan also said in the interview that he expected the other 75% of the bank's tax savings to flow through to the bottom line and be returned to investors through dividends and buybacks.

Earnings were hurt by the potential anti-money-laundering settlement. The bank said it set aside $608 million for ""regulatory and legal matters."" The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has previously flagged U.S. Bank's anti-money-laundering program for deficiencies, and the bank said it expects to pay civil monetary penalties to resolve this.

The bank had also previously disclosed that it was being investigated by the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office for its relationship with a former customer, race-car driver Scott Tucker, who was convicted of fraud related to payday loans. The bank said it is working on a settlement, which it expects to include a deferred prosecution agreement and payment of a penalty.

Revenue rose 4% to $5.64 billion, helped by rising interest rates and increased lending. Like its peers, U.S. Bank has benefited from higher interest rates, which allow it to charge more on loans. The bank's net interest income grew by 6%. The Federal Reserve raised short-term rates three times last year.

Average loans grew by 2.6% over the year, driven by consumer lending.

In a call with analysts, U.S. Bank Chief Executive Andy Cecere said the new tax law was ""a very positive development."" U.S. Bank already announced that it, like some of its peers, will raise wages for lower-paid employees and donate to charity with some of its tax savings.

Mr. Cecere was upbeat, saying that the new tax law could create jobs and encourage consumers to spend and hinting at how regulators were looking more favorably on the banking industry. ""The economy appears to be on firm footing,"" Mr. Cecere said. ""The regulatory environment is becoming more supportive of growth.""

The new tax law is expected to help banks over the long term, by lowering the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. But the new law is having a disparate impact across bank earnings this quarter.

U.S. Bank and PNC Financial Services Group Inc., for example, received a short-term earnings boost. But Citigroup Inc., which reported results Tuesday, had its quarterly earnings wiped out by the new tax law.

The tax law hurt Citigroup's earnings because of that bank's deferred tax assets, which are past losses that the company can use to defray future tax bills. With a lower tax rate, those assets are no longer as valuable. U.S. Bank, however, has deferred tax liabilities, or taxes it expects to pay in the future. The new lower tax rate is a boon for those future earnings. U.S. Bank's net deferred tax liability was $588 million at the end of the third quarter."
Ctit Group,Goldman Sachs's Tax Wobble Is a Buying Opportunity," Jan 18, 2018",1,"Goldman Sachs likes to be a little different. Its shareholders found that extended to the short-term impact of the tax bill.

Unlike its peers, the nature of the big, one-time accounting write-down it suffered isn't mostly cosmetic -- it will affect how much cash it can return over the next six months. In the long run, though, lower taxes will be a boon.

Citigroup on Tuesday booked a $22 billion tax charge, due mostly to revaluations of its deferred-tax assets.

The hit to their key regulatory capital ratios was minor, thanks in part to excess capital the bank holds. Citi said the write-down won't affect its plans to return $60 billion of capital to shareholders through 2020.

Goldman is taking a smaller write-down of just $4.4 billion, but the impact on shareholder payouts will be bigger thanks to its smaller balance sheet and leaner capital position. On Wednesday, Goldman warned that its pace of buybacks would be slower than normal through the first half of 2018 and its shares fell.

The critical regulatory gauge appears to be the bank's supplementary leverage ratio, a measure of total leverage.

It fell to 5.8% at the end of 2017 from 6.1% three months earlier as a result of the charge.

That is still well above the Federal Reserve's 3% minimum, but what matters is how it fares under the Fed's hypothetical scenarios in annual stress tests simulating a sharp global downturn.

Last spring, Goldman got through with a still-comfortable 4.1%. It apparently didn't want to take chances during the next round of tests, though.

Chief Financial Officer Martin Chavez said Goldman typically aims to buy back around $5 billion to $6 billion per annual stress test period, which runs through June. That will slow in the first half of 2018.

Back in October, Goldman said it had been authorized by the Fed to buy back up to $8.7 billion over the 12 months through June 2018. So far, it has done just $3.8 billion.

Shareholders didn't like that, but as Mr. Chavez pointed out, Goldman still stands to benefit from tax reform. That isn't only from a lower tax rate itself but also from indirect effects.

Mergers and acquisitions, for instance, began rebounding when the details of tax cuts emerged. This probably benefits Goldman more than any other major bank thanks to their strong M&A franchise. Near-term weakness could prove to be a buying opportunity."
Ctit Group,More Companies To Report Charges," Jan 17, 2018",1,"The new tax law's impact on deferred tax assets is likely to ensnare other firms in coming days, even if the numbers aren't as big as at Citigroup Inc. and General Motors Co.

The primary reason for the charges is something that will benefit the companies in the long run: the U.S. tax law's reduction of the corporate tax rate to 21% from the old 35% rate.

Deferred tax assets are past tax credits and deductions that companies can hold on to and use to defray future tax bills. But when the tax rate declines, companies' tax bills shrink.

Many of those credits and deductions become less valuable. This is because it will require a lot more profit to use them up and that will likely occur over a longer period than originally thought.

In that case, companies must write down their deferred tax assets, leading to charges against earnings.

Other companies reporting fourth-quarter results in coming weeks also are expected to take write-downs.

For instance, Bank of America Corp., which reports earnings Wednesday, has already said it expects a $3 billion charge.

American International Group Inc. said in November that it could see a reduction of about $7 billion in the value of its deferred tax assets from a lowering of the tax rate. The company, which had $20.7 billion in deferred tax assets as of the end of 2016, reports fourth-quarter earnings Feb. 8."
Ctit Group,Citigroup Can Take This Hit," Jan 17, 2018",1,"Citigroup posted one of its largest quarterly losses ever on Tuesday thanks to a $22 billion write-down related to tax reform. Its shares promptly rose.

No, this isn't opposite day. As for most banks, the new tax laws will strongly benefit Citigroup in the long run. Meanwhile, the write-down will do only negligible damage to Citigroup's balance-sheet strength and may even boost its investment image.

The $22 billion is mostly due to changes in the value of deferred-tax assets -- credits against future tax bills, many left over from the financial crisis.

For the most part they don't contribute toward Citigroup's regulatory capital -- what regulators look at when deciding how much they will allow in buybacks and dividends.

Yet, because they add to the bank's total equity, Citigroup's deferred-tax assets have historically made its return on equity -- a key gauge of bank profitability -- look lower than peers.

Citigroup management's current 2018 target is for a 10% return on common tangible equity, excluding certain deferred-tax assets. Going forward, the company will likely restate its targets to be just in terms of return on tangible common equity. Since Citigroup will be paying a much lower tax rate from now on, management predicted its return on tangible common equity will rise by more than 2 percentage points by 2020. In 2017 it was 8.1%.

Losing tens of billions of dollars is rarely cause for celebration, but that looks to be the case for Citigroup."
Ctit Group,Citi Takes $22 Billion Tax-Law Hit --- Quarterly earnings are erased but stock rises as investors expect measure to be boon," Jan 17, 2018",0,"The tax law wiped out Citigroup Inc.'s fourth-quarter earnings and then some, with the bank taking a $22 billion charge that caused it to post a loss of $18.3 billion -- its biggest loss ever for a single quarter.

Investors looked past the immediate results to the near-term future, when they expect the tax law will boost earnings for Citigroup and other banks. Shares rose 0.4% to $77.11 on a day when the market was down.

Citigroup Chief Executive Michael Corbat and Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach were upbeat in calls with analysts and reporters, saying the tax changes will bolster their future profits and buoy their clients, echoing the sentiment last week of JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO James Dimon.

Specifically, Citigroup increased one of its key profitability goals in response to the tax changes and said it was still on track to return capital to shareholders according to a plan it laid out in July.

Underneath the $22 billion tax charge, Citigroup turned in results that beat analysts' expectations with higher revenue, more lending and flat expenses.

Without the tax charge, the bank would have made $1.28 a share, beating the $1.19 expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. With the tax charge, the loss amounted to $7.15 a share for the fourth quarter alone and wiped out nearly six quarters of profit.

Mr. Gerspach brushed off the tax-related loss as a temporary bump in the road. ""It's something we think we can quickly overcome and it's not a headwind that causes us to alter any of our existing plans,"" Mr. Gerspach said. The short-term pain, he said, is ""a pretty good trade-off.""

Until now, the biggest quarterly loss at Citigroup was in the depths of the financial crisis at the end of 2008. But that loss had a different tone: The bank lost $17.3 billion as it took huge write-downs on subprime mortgage securities and bad loans.

This time, the New York bank's loss comes from an accounting maneuver forced by a favorable piece of legislation in Washington. Citigroup already had warned Wall Street about the looming loss, saying last month that it expected to take a hit of about $20 billion to profit this quarter.

The quarterly loss also is something of a cleansing for Citigroup. The main reason for the tax charge is that the new tax law forced the bank to write down the value of its huge pile of deferred-tax assets. Those assets are essentially past losses that Citigroup racked up during the financial crisis and which it can use to defray future tax bills. The tax law, which slashes the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, made those assets less valuable.

But the deferred-tax assets also have been a shadow over Citigroup's results for nearly the past decade, stoking investor uncertainty. Mr. Corbat, who became CEO in 2012, has made working through them a priority, though the progress had been slow. At the end of the third quarter, they were about $45 billion, compared with a peak of about $55 billion. Mr. Gerspach said Tuesday that he expected the amount would fall to about $23 billion.

About $3 billion of the $22 billion charge came from the newly enacted, one-time charge on U.S. companies' overseas earnings. Citigroup is more focused on overseas markets than some of its peers.

Equities-trading revenue fell 23%. The bank said it could lose as much as $370 million on a single client. JPMorgan confirmed last week that it had suffered a loss as high as $273 million on a margin loan to Steinhoff International Holdings NV, a South African retail company dealing with an accounting scandal. Mr. Gerspach declined to comment in response to repeated questions about whether the Citigroup loss also came from Steinhoff."
Ctit Group,Banks Upbeat As Taxes Muddy Earnings," Jan 13, 2018",1,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. posted fourth-quarter earnings that were roiled by the recent tax overhaul but forecast the changes will bolster future profits and stoke the broader U.S. economy.

JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said a $2.4 billion charge related to the tax law caused its profit to fall 37% from a year earlier to $4.23 billion. Even so, Chief Executive James Dimon said the tax law enacted late last year was ""a big, significant positive and much of it will fall to our bottom line in 2018 and beyond.""

Other big banks, including Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., have said the tax law will result in billions of dollars in one-time charges when they report fourth-quarter results next week. They, too, have said those hits will give way to substantial long-term gains.

That bodes well for banks, coming at a time when the economy is showing strength, unemployment remains low and interest rates are inching higher.

""The backdrop is set up well for these banks: higher interest rates, improving GDP growth that has to help loan growth,"" said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Dallas-based Hodges Capital Management, which owns shares of Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Bank of America Corp.

At Wells Fargo, the immediate impact of the tax law was a gain due to shrinking tax liabilities, which boosted net income by about $3.35 billion.

PNC Financial Services Group Inc., which also reported earnings Friday, similarly cited a tax-related boost to net income due to the declining value of tax liabilities. CEO William Demchak said in an interview it will take time to see how the tax-code changes play out among customers and consumers, or if it spurs more borrowing.

But overall, ""for all the investment decisions that companies make, the U.S. just got that much more attractive,"" Mr. Demchak said. ""It's going to win more than it won before in terms of where people choose to do business activity and invest.""

David James, director of research for Denver-based James Advantage Funds, said the tax-overhaul impact is ""music to people's ears"" and is hopeful higher profits will lead to increased dividends and buybacks at banks like JPMorgan. He cautioned, though, that investors will soon bake in boosts from the new tax law into banks' expectations.

""If this becomes the new normal it may become harder to impress the markets,"" said Mr. James, whose firm's James Balanced: Golden RainbowFund owns about $11.5 million of JPMorgan shares.

For JPMorgan, the one-time charge is related to changes in the value of the bank's deferred tax assets and the need to repatriate profits held overseas. Its corporate and investment bank, in particular, felt the blow.

Wells Fargo and PNC, on the other hand, had net deferred tax liabilities. The changes to the tax code caused them to write down that part of that liability -- taxes payable in the future -- which resulted in a gain that boosts reported results.

The varied effects of the tax law and the complexity it introduced into earnings masked differences in the underlying performance of JPMorgan and Wells Fargo.

JPMorgan's results were solid, led by a record profit in its commercial bank, which jumped 39% to $957 million from the year-earlier period. Profit in its consumer and community bank unit rose 11% to $2.63 billion from the fourth quarter of 2016.

But JPMorgan's corporate and investment banking unit was weighed down by weak trading, slumping 17% to $3.37 billion after stripping out the tax-overhaul impact. It also was hit with losses as high as $273 million related to client Steinhoff International Holdings NV, which is dealing with a wide-ranging accounting probe that is expected to also dig into other large banks' results.

Wells Fargo, meanwhile, continued to suffer from its regulatory headaches. While it gained from the tax changes, that was offset by $3.25 billion in new litigation charges. The bank said this was the result of ""a variety of matters,"" including mortgage-related investigations, its sales-practices scandal and other consumer-banking issues.

The bank's loan portfolio shrank in the fourth quarter, the profitability of its lending activities declined and businesses like mortgage banking and investment banking contracted.

The bank hasn't incorporated much economic impact from the tax overhaul into its current forecast, but executives said they thought consumers would likely benefit.

""There have been millions of employed folks across the country that have gotten pay raises and bonuses and the like and I think that's a net positive for economic growth,"" Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan said on an analyst call.

JPMorgan's Mr. Dimon also was optimistic, noting the bank expects to have roughly $3.6 billion in additional net income as a result of the tax overhaul.

He cautioned that there are uncertainties ahead since many of the business-tax changes will require new regulations from the Treasury Department, and that has yet to happen. But the bank has ideas on how it can use the windfall.

JPMorgan finance chief Marianne Lake said the bank plans to ""continue to lean into"" investment opportunities such as its own bankers and offices, potential global expansion, digital capabilities and payments. JPMorgan's strategy on dividend increases and its repurchase programs ""might be a bigger dollar number,"" too, she said.

More broadly, Ms. Lake said she expects small business and commercial banking will have new catalysts for spending because of the tax overhaul. ""Already very good credit trends we think will be good for longer,"" she said.

The new tax code also could prompt greater competition for new business among banks.

""If the economy heats up because of tax reform and everybody's got higher loan growth, then somebody may very well begin to defend their deposit franchise in order to fund it,"" said John Shrewsberry, Wells Fargo's finance chief."
Ctit Group,"Banks Set for Hits Tied to New Tax Law --- Despite large charges for the fourth quarter, investors see benefits in the longer term"," Jan 11, 2018",1,"It is going to be a noisy quarter for bank earnings. Because of the tax-overhaul law, big banks are going to record a host of special charges that cut into fourth-quarter profit.

How big is the bill? Five of the biggest U.S. banks are likely to report a total of about$31 billion in tax-related hits for the fourth quarter, according to the banks' recent disclosures and public comments.

Don't expect investors to be overly alarmed, though. The banks should benefit from the new tax law in the longer term. In fact, with the U.S. corporate tax rate falling to 21% from 35%, many banks could make back any losses within a few years, or even sooner.

The new law is ""good for us,"" Bank of America Corp. Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said at a conference last month.

Still, investors will have to be on their toes when the banks' fourth-quarter earnings announcements begin Friday with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. Tax-law changes could make banks' core earnings -- which exclude charges and other one-time or nonoperating items -- less clear. Plus, they will probably make earnings announcements and conference calls more complicated as banks strive to explain the law's impact.

Because the new tax law was signed in the fourth quarter, accounting rules require companies to reflect the law's impact in that period.

That means some banks will have to take big upfront charges to write down the value of their deferred-tax assets and pay a one-time tax imposed on their earnings that are generated and held outside the U.S.

""It is going to muddy the waters a little bit,"" said Janet Pegg, an analyst at Zion Research Group, an accounting and tax research firm. ""We're going to be depending on clear disclosure from the companies.""

Another wrinkle: Because of the reduction in the tax rate, banks and other companies will have an incentive to ""kitchen-sink things,"" said Christopher Marinac, director of research at FIG Partners in Atlanta. That is, to accelerate deductible expenses to record them in 2017 instead of 2018. That would have the effect of lowering taxable profits in the period when the higher tax rate still applies, thus maximizing the deductions' benefit.

Complicating things further is that any 2018 earnings guidance from banks will be harder to interpret since the new lower tax rate means forecastswill be incorporating a sharply lower tax liability.

Citigroup Inc. may be most affected by the two provisions prompting banks to take immediate charges.

Finance chief John Gerspach said at a December conference that Citigroup expects a fourth-quarter charge of about $20 billion, mostly from writing down the big bank's huge pile of deferred-tax assets.

These are past tax credits and deductions that companies can hold on to and use to defray future tax bills, sort of like an IOU. Citigroup has $45.5 billion of them, generated by the losses that the bank suffered during the financial crisis.

But when the tax rate declines, companies' tax bills shrink. So many of those credits and deductions become less valuable and must be written down, leading to charges against earnings.

The reverse can happen also: Wells Fargo had net deferred-tax liabilities, or taxes payable in the future, of about $7 billion as of the end of 2016. That could lead Wells Fargo to record a gain, though it hasn't announced any such move.

Part of Citigroup's charge also stems from a tax on companies' foreign earnings.

In the previous system, the U.S. taxed corporate profits no matter where in the world they were earned, leading many companies to keep foreign profits overseas instead of bringing them back to the U.S. where they would be taxed at a 35% rate.

The new law changes the U.S. approach to a ""territorial"" system, with taxes levied only on U.S.-generated profits.

But the new law also imposes a one-time tax of 15.5% on foreign-held liquid assets such as cash and 8% on illiquid assets. Zion Research estimates that will cost financial companies in the S&P 500 a total of $13.56 billion.

Among other big banks, Bank of America has said it expects a $3 billion charge from writing down deferred-tax assets; JPMorgan sees a potential adjustment of as much as $2 billion from the foreign-earnings issue; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects a $5 billion charge from a combination of both issues; and Morgan Stanley sees a $1.25 billion charge, mostly from its deferred-tax assets.

European banks will be affected, too: Deutsche Bank AG expects a charge of 1.5 billion euros ($1.79 billion), Barclays PLC sees a charge of GBP 1 billion ($1.35 billion) and Credit Suisse AG expects a charge of 2.3 billion Swiss francs ($2.34 billion).

Apart from their earnings, some banks will see other financial effects from the new tax law. Write-downs of deferred-tax assets will lead to reductions in some banks' regulatory capital and will cut into their book value, a figure closely watched by investors.

But even as banks take their fourth-quarter charges, the tax-rate reduction to 21% is starting to work for them. Large national and regional banks should see an average 15% boost in their earnings per share by 2019 from the lower tax rate, Bernstein analyst John McDonald said in a research note last week.

Despite any hits to profit now, ""I think investors will see past it,"" Mr. Marinac of FIG Partners said."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: More Lenders Take Hit From Tax Overhaul," Jan 8, 2018",1,"Two more big banks said Friday they expect to take significant charges against fourth-quarter earnings because of the impact of the new U.S. tax-overhaul law.

Morgan Stanley said it expects to take a fourth-quarter charge of $1.25 billion. Deutsche Bank AG said it anticipates a charge of about 1.5 billion euros ($1.81 billion).

Morgan Stanley said provisions of the new tax law will cost it $1.4 billion, primarily from a reduction in the value of its deferred-tax assets. The bank said this charge will be offset in part by a $160 million benefit from remeasuring reserves and interest related to Internal Revenue Service examinations of its tax returns.

Deutsche Bank said its charge also relates to deferred-tax assets and is expected to lead the German bank to record a small full-year loss for 2017.

Deferred-tax assets are past credits and deductions that companies can hold on to and use to defray future tax bills. Some banks have large quantities of them, generated by the losses they suffered during the financial crisis. The new law's reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% means many of those credits and deductions will become less valuable and must be written down.

The announcements follow similar recent disclosures from other banks, including Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., that expect fourth-quarter charges because of the new tax law. In addition to reductions in the value of deferred-tax assets, some banks also must pay a one-time tax imposed by the new law on overseas earnings. The reduction in the corporate tax rate means the new law is expected to benefit many banks in the long term, though neither Morgan Stanley nor Deutsche Bank mentioned that Friday."
Ctit Group,Ripple Steals Some of Bitcoin's Thunder," Jan 6, 2018",1,"In 2017, bitcoin became a household word among investors. This year, it may be Ripple's turn.

XRP, a five-year-old digital currency offered by San Francisco startup Ripple, has soared 1,135% in the past month alone, quickly becoming the second-largest crypto-asset behind bitcoin. The rally included a 32% jump in the first days of 2018.

Such moves have become almost normal in the tumultuous virtual-currency mania of the past year. Ripple, like a bevy of other crypto startups, has benefited from the blind hope many investors are placing in largely unregulated and loosely defined bitcoin-related businesses. What is surprising about Ripple, though, comes from some of the differences that it has with bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value.

While both focus on electronic payments, bitcoin is governed by a fractious global array of technologists and antiestablishment libertarians. It was created nine years ago to reduce the power of big banks widely blamed for the financial crisis.

XRP, on the other hand, is centralized around a single for-profit company, Ripple, that has courted banks with a promise to reduce their costs. While some banks such as Spain's Banco Santander SA and Bank of America Corp. have signed up for Ripple's international money-transfer services, many large players such as Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings PLC have stayed away and are pursuing their own payment improvements.

Ripple hasn't disclosed how much money the banks are moving over its payments network, which offers software to transfer dollars, yen and euros more quickly and inexpensively. It says it has signed up about 100 banks, but that is a fraction of the 16,600 institutions that use Visa Inc. or the thousands that use the cooperative that runs the international bank messaging service, known as Swift.

Investors have been lining up anyway. XRP's rise in 2017 was 24 times steeper than bitcoin's own ascent. Overall, the company has sold about 38.7 billion tokens, which are called XRP by some and Ripple by others. The market value of those tokens, according to research site coinmarketcap.com: about $118 billion.

""It's amazing what's going on,"" said Chris Larsen, Ripple's co-founder and chairman. ""You've got to be standing in the middle of the road when the luck-truck hits you.""

A former online-lending specialist who co-founded Prosper Marketplace Inc., Mr. Larsen owns roughly 5% of the outstanding XRP tokens, according to a person familiar with the company. That stake is now valued at about $15.8 billion at current market prices, up nearly 500-fold from its $32 million value a year ago.

The huge rise shows that ""real utility matters,"" said Ripple Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse. ""Real customers matter.""

Despite bitcoin's popularity among investors, its utility as a payments platform has suffered because of network delays and rising transaction costs. And many bankers still distrust bitcoin, with JPMorgan CEO James Dimon last year calling it ""a fraud.""

Ripple, meanwhile, has become a cash-flow positive, profitable business, according to Mr. Garlinghouse. That is a rarity among crypto startups, though a big part comes from the XRP sales themselves in addition to the fees that Ripple generates by selling software licenses and collecting fees on individual money transfers.

Then there are the 61 billion tokens that Ripple owns and hasn't yet sold. Those have soared to a value of about $185 billion. While the lofty sum could plummet at any time, it is still a staggering amount, greater than the cash hoards of nearly every company in the S&P 500 stock index, including Microsoft Corp., which has $138 billion.

Also, since the XRP held by Ripple isn't easy to trade like a major currency, Ripple couldn't quickly convert major amounts of XRP to dollars without risking a crash in XRP's price, a possibility that has made some investors nervous.

To counter those criticisms, Ripple took 90% of its remaining XRP holdings, about 55 billion tokens, and put them in 55 separate contracts designed to prevent the company from tapping more than 1 billion tokens in any one month.

At the beginning of 2017, Mr. Garlinghouse, a 46-year-old former Yahoo and AOL executive, took over the chief executive spot from Mr. Larsen, who remained chairman. Mr. Larsen says the Topeka, Kan., native impressed him with his blunt assessment of some of Yahoo's past problems.

Mr. Garlinghouse, who joined the company as president and chief operating officer in 2015, has a stake of about 6% in Ripple, said a person familiar with the company.

Despite the surge in XRP's value, Ripple, like all crypto companies, carries big questions. One is whether more banks will adopt it instead of choosing payment projects where they have more control and a greater stake. There are also well-funded startups, including R3 and Digital Asset Holdings, which recently scored a contract from Australian exchange operator ASX Ltd."
Ctit Group,Dow 25000: Number of Listed Companies Is Falling --- Analysts debate what role such a drop has played in the nearly nine-year stock rally," Jan 5, 2018",1,"As the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke through 25000 and other stock-market indexes continue rising to new highs, the number of publicly traded U.S. companies keeps shrinking.

That phenomenon has investors and analysts debating what role the decline in number of listed companies has played in the nearly nine-year rally, and more broadly what it means for investing.

Some say it is a simple question of supply and demand: As money pouring into stocks rises as the number of companies and publicly traded shares falls, the remaining listed companies are bound to get a lift. Others say it is more complicated than that, arguing there is little evidence that the shrinking market translates directly into higher share prices.

What is clear is that the number of publicly traded companies has been steadily declining. In 1996, more than 7,400 companies were listed on U.S. stock exchanges. Today, that figure is less than half, according to the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.

The number of listed companies peaked during the late 1990s, when hundreds of startups cashed in on the rise of the internet by selling shares to the public. Many of these companies disappeared during the dot-com bust that followed. Small companies are also staying private longer, preferring to raise venture capital or other private money rather than having to abide by more-stringent regulatory requirements of public companies. Merger and acquisition activity continues to shrink the number of public companies too.

Years of robust corporate buybacks, meanwhile, have reduced the number of shares available to investors. Company share buybacks hit a record of $572 billion in 2015, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.

Some investors believe the dwindling number of publicly traded companies and shares outstanding has helped boost blue-chip indexes, coming as the amount of money flowing into U.S. stocks has risen steadily. Assets under management for U.S. stock mutual funds and index funds are up about six times to more than $10 trillion from 1996 to 2016, according to Credit Suisse.

When demand for stocks rises but the supply of shares available shrinks, that helps push stock prices higher, says David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Canadian investment firm Gluskin Sheff & Associates Inc.

In his view, the reduction in shares outstanding has been equivalent to a 15% boost to earnings since 2009.

Some analysts note that vast majority of the stocks that have disappeared were small or microcap. They wouldn't have had a major influence on the broader blue-chip indexes anyway, since most weight stocks by size rather than equally.

""What it does is make the markets more efficient,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, of the shakeout of smaller companies from public exchanges. And while common shares outstanding in the S&P 500 have shrunk each year since 2010, it been at a rate of only about 1% a year or less, according to Citigroup.

Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at Citigroup, says companies seeing the greatest share-count reductions haven't outperformed the market, suggesting the share reduction has limited impact. He also said that while the number of shares are down overall, the drop has been less than 1% a year in recent years. That decline has been enough to help offset issuance of stock-option grants that add to the supply of shares, but it hasn't been sufficient to boost the overall market, he said.

Still, the diminishing number of listed companies has affected the market in other ways, some investors say.

The reliance on private capital has made it harder for stock investors to get exposure to younger companies that would have otherwise listed on an exchange more quickly. The average age of a listed company last year was about 18 years old, while in 1996, companies that were public were about 12 years old, according to data compiled by Pantheon Partners.

Amazon, for example, was considered a small-cap stock when it went public in 1997, and has ballooned into a $566.3 billion behemoth, giving early investors a significant fortune. Today, companies like Facebook Inc. wait until they are multibillion-dollar businesses before going public, while others such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc. have remained private.

Some analysts suggest that large stocks such as Netflix Inc. or Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company, may be benefiting indirectly from the lack of startup companies in the public markets. With fewer opportunities to buy small, high-growth companies in the stock market, investors are putting more money in bigger, established companies and passive investment funds."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Citigroup Is Rebuked On Laundering Curbs," Jan 5, 2018",1,"A U.S. regulator said that Citigroup Inc. hasn't lived up to its promises to beef up anti-money-laundering procedures.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said Thursday that Citigroup's deposit-taking bank, Citibank NA, hasn't adhered to a 2012 order that accused it of failing to fully comply with the Bank Secrecy Act. This requires financial firms to report suspicious activities and take other measures to prevent potential money laundering.

Thursday's regulatory action suggested to some lawyers that the administration of President Donald Trump, despite promises to loosen bank regulation, is drawing distinctions.

""The big question for the new administration was how they were going to categorize [anti-money-laundering] compliance,"" said Ross Delston, a Washington-based attorney who specializes in the topic. ""Would they view it as yet another regulatory burden left over from previous administrations, which they abhor? Or would they view it as it should be viewed, with a law enforcement and national security framework?""

The Citigroup order could signal the administration is drawing a distinction on what exactly it is willing to roll back, he added.

The original 2012 cease-and-desist order against Citigroup said the bank had inadequate internal controls and independent testing, This, the OCC said, prevented it from conducting adequate due diligence on customers in correspondent and retail banking. As a result, the bank failed to file some reports on suspicious activities, the regulator said at the time.

The OCC then ordered Citigroup to fix those problems but didn't fine the bank. In Thursday's statement, the OCC didn't specify its complaints, except to say that Citigroup had ""fail(ed) to complete corrective actions to address . . . compliance issues as required by the order."" The OCC fined the bank $70 million and left the consent order in place.

The bank neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing following the OCC's Thursday announcement or the 2012 order.

""Citi is committed to taking all necessary and appropriate steps to remedy the concerns identified by the OCC,"" a spokesman said. ""We have made substantial investments to enhance our [anti-money-laundering] programs and we maintain a commitment to developing an industry-leading program to help to protect the integrity of the financial system."""
Ctit Group,Merrill Widens Its Ban on Bitcoin," Jan 4, 2018",1,"Merrill Lynch has blocked clients and financial advisers who trade on their behalf from buying bitcoin, citing concerns over the cryptocurrency's investment suitability.

The ban applies to all accounts and precludes the firm's roughly 17,000 advisers not only from pitching bitcoin-related investments but also from executing client requests to trade Grayscale Investments LLC's Bitcoin Investment Trust fund, according to a person familiar with the matter. The ban extends an existing policy barring access to newly launched bitcoin futures.

Existing positions in the bitcoin fund can be maintained in brokerage accounts, but not in fee-based advisory accounts, the person said. The brokerage arm of Bank of America Corp. put the policy into place Dec. 8, right before the launch of the first U.S. bitcoin futures, the person said.

""The decision to close GBTC to new purchases is driven by concerns pertaining to suitability and eligibility standards of this product,"" according to an internal memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, referring to the Grayscale fund's trading symbol.

A spokeswoman for Merrill Lynch confirmed the decision, which applies firmwide and includes self-directed accounts.

The Grayscale fund is an open-ended trust that is invested exclusively in bitcoin and derives its value from the price of bitcoin, according to Grayscale Investments. It was created for investors seeking exposure to bitcoin through a traditional investment vehicle, the firm said, and it trades over the counter.

Merrill Lynch's decision is the latest sign of Wall Street's wariness when it comes to digital currencies. The U.S. brokerage arm of UBS Group AG already bars its advisers from trading bitcoin-related products, according to a person familiar with the policy. Several other firms -- including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Royal Bank of Canada -- told clients that they wouldn't offer them access to the first bitcoin futures market when it went live Dec. 10."
Ctit Group,"The Cashless Society Has Finally Arrived -- In China --- Mobile payments change how people shop, borrow -- even panhandle"," Jan 4, 2018",1,"BEIJING -- Soliciting handouts near a grocery store, Zhao Shenji, a slender man with shorn hair, made giving easy for Beijing residents accustomed to relying on their smartphones.

""Recommend using WeChat Pay,"" said a placard the beggar displayed.

It was a literal sign of the times. Payment via mobile-phone services such as WeChat is sweeping the country. After gaining a beachhead as a means to buy things online, mobile payment moved on to store purchases and is fast becoming the way many people in China pay for just about everything.

That includes small personal debts. Richard Lau, a young management consultant waiting to get into the historic St. Michael's Cathedral in Qingdao one recent day, found he had no cash for the 20-yuan admission, so he borrowed it from another man in line and immediately zapped him the amount by phone.

Behind the trend are internet titans Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., which are elbowing aside banks to take a growing role in daily commerce. Their success offers a glimpse of a future where technology firms drive innovations in finance just as they have in retailing, autos and the media.

Though the U.S. saw $112 billion of mobile payments in 2016, by a Forrester Research estimate, such payments in China totaled $9 trillion, according to iResearch Consulting Group, a Chinese firm.

For Alibaba and Tencent, the payoff isn't just the transaction fees they make from merchants, typically 0.6%. It's also the consumer data collected, which can transform their apps into marketing platforms for an expanding array of services, from bike sharing to travel.

Some of the repercussions of increasing mobile payments are just coming into view. The payments haven't been required to go through the central bank's clearing system, making it harder for China's monetary authorities to follow capital flows and watch for money laundering and fraud. The People's Bank of China has ordered a new payment-clearing platform that will require nonbank financial firms to give it a clearer view of mobile payments by the summer of 2018.

Consumers also are being offered more pitches for loans, investments and other financial products via smartphone. Short-term consumer credit in China soared 160% in the first eight months of 2017 from a year earlier, according to the central bank. Some analysts think the growing ease of borrowing is part of the reason.

Chinese, meanwhile, are making less use of old-fashioned cash, as in coins and folding money. They spent about 66 trillion yuan (nearly $10 trillion) that way in 2016, down about 10% in two years, according to a central-bank payments report.

The path to mobile payment was blazed by Alibaba, which hosts online shopping bazaars where merchants sell goods to consumers. More than a dozen years ago, Alibaba, taking a page from the U.S. company now called PayPal Holdings Inc., started a system named Alipay as an escrow service. It would hold payments until shoppers received their goods.

The service caught on among buyers who didn't always trust vendors to deliver as promised. Alipay evolved into an online and mobile-payment service and passed PayPal as the largest mobile-payment platform in 2013.

That year, Tencent linked a mobile-payment system to its popular WeChat instant-messaging app. With Alipay already in place, the challenge for Tencent was getting people to link bank accounts to its service.

It devised a strategy based on the Lunar New Year, when Chinese people give red envelopes of cash. Tencent encouraged WeChat users to send digital red packets to friends for the 2014 Lunar New Year, letting them input a sum of money and send it to friends, who would divide the loot.

Tencent set things up so those who opened their virtual envelopes first got a bigger share. Over a 24-hour period, 16 million red packets were sent, and suddenly WeChat Pay was in the mobile-payments game. It now has about 40% of China's mobile-payment market, versus 54% for Alipay, according to iResearch.

They work in similar ways. People link their bank accounts to the app, then pay for things by scanning a merchant's QR code or having the merchant scan theirs. People also can transfer money by tapping on an icon in WeChat or Alipay.

At a night market in Taiwan recently, Manni Cheng, a textile saleswoman from Shanghai, paid cash for grilled prawns but then noticed the vendor accepted Alipay. She asked for her cash back and paid with her phone.

Ms. Cheng said she likes Alipay because it lets her track her spending and avoid carrying a lot of cash. Money in her Alipay balance is transferred to the app's money-market fund.

""It's a payment tool with wealth-management functions,"" Ms. Cheng said. The seamless use of phones as wallets rarely fails to amaze foreigners traveling in China.

Tencent has created a platform for businesses so customers can ""follow"" them for news and discounts. Customers who follow Gap Inc., for instance, might be alerted to promotions and discounts when they return to the store, potentially generating more sales for Gap and revenue for WeChat.

Alibaba can monitor the shows people watch on its Youku Tudou video-streaming site and push ads targeted to them, generating ad commissions and product sales for Alibaba, plus a clearer picture of consumer behavior. While using the data within their ecosystems, both internet giants say they don't sell it to others.

Conditions in China made it ripe for this innovation. Credit cards never caught on in a big way. Discretionary spending wasn't an option for most people until recent years, and there has long been a cultural aversion to debt in China. On top of that, the government made it tough for Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. to set up shop.

The rise of tech companies as financial powers has dealt a blow to traditional banks. China's state-owned banks lost nearly $23 billion in fees in 2015 they might have collected from card fees, according to a November 2016 report from EY (formerly Ernst & Young) and Singapore's DBS Bank. The report projected the annual fee loss could widen to $60 billion by 2020.

The larger problem for banks might be that Alibaba and Tencent often know more about their customers than they do. If a Beijing car dealer uses a bank debit card for a business trip to Shanghai, the bank knows what airline he or she flew, as well as the hotel and restaurants patronized. ""But if the 'customer interface' is happening elsewhere, the bank has zero visibility over transactions,"" said James Lloyd, Asia-Pacific FinTech Leader at EY. ""That's not a good situation to find yourself in.""

U.S. payment-processing firms have been ramping up their own digital-wallet efforts. Visa and Mastercard both have mobile apps that allow users to pay via near-field communication and are incorporating biometrics into their offerings. They also work with Apple Pay and Samsung Pay.

PayPal, which allowed people to beam money to each other via Palm Pilots in the late 1990s, has formed partnerships with more than 20 other companies to extend its mobile payments, including Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Chinese search giant Baidu Inc. About 34% of PayPal's payment volume is mobile, said Bill Ready, chief operating officer.

Smartphones are vastly more common than Palm Pilots ever were, yet Apple Inc. has struggled to get consumers to use its Apple Pay service, now accepted at more than 50% of all U.S. retail locations.

Just 19% of iPhone users have tried Apple Pay at least once, according to an estimate by Loup Ventures, a venture-capital firm. Loup said about 35% of all new iPhones sold in 2017 have activated Apple Pay. Apple said in November that active users of the service more than doubled, and annual transactions are up threefold.

In some parts of the world, changes that resemble China's are taking place. In Scandinavia, Nordic and Dutch banks have cut total branch levels by about 50% from peak levels, and Sweden hasn't had checks since the late 1980s, according to Citi Research, part of Citigroup Inc.

Tencent and Ant Financial Services, the Alibaba affiliate that operates Alipay, are forming partnerships with payment processing companies across Europe and investing in mobile payment firms in India, Thailand and other countries.

Ant Financial also sought to buy U.S. money-transfer firm MoneyGram International Inc., whose 200-country network enables users to send cash through banks, stores and kiosks. But the companies said Tuesday that a U.S. national-security panel refused to approve the $1.2 billion deal.

WeChat Pay and Alipay are gaining attention in U.S. tourist centers after striking deals with hotels and resorts. A group of Chinese tourists recently dined at the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, where the menu includes T-bone Australian lamb, chilled crab legs and handmade dim sum. They settled their bill with a smartphone.

""One couple stopped to watch the WeChat Pay transaction and asked for an explanation,"" said Bruce Bommarito, a Caesars executive. ""They were surprised. . .and wanted to know if this payment method was available to Americans as well."" Americans can sign up for WeChat but can't link it to U.S. bank accounts. Alipay isn't available for Americans as of now.

Tencent and Alibaba say they have no plans to push their payment platforms to U.S. consumers. Many Americans don't see the need for mobile payments, since their plastic cards and cash are welcomed and some merchants still accept checks.

""Any new way of paying has to prove itself to be incrementally better than any other options you have,"" said James Wester of research firm IDC Financial Insights. In the U.S., ""plastic is convenient, widely accepted and understood by the customer."""
Ctit Group,Nafta Risk Dogs Canadian Deals," Jan 2, 2018",1,"TORONTO -- Despite uncertainty around the North American Free Trade Agreement, mergers and acquisitions involving Canadian companies were strong in 2017, though deal activity could cool in 2018, bankers and companies say.

The fate of the free-trade agreement, likely to be decided in the first several months of the new year, is the biggest question overhanging the Canadian economy, according to Canadian bankers and executives.

The U.S. tax overhaul also is clouding the 2018 outlook, these people say.

In terms of trade, exports to the U.S. represent roughly one-fifth of the country's gross domestic product, according to the U.S. Embassy in Canada, and the country's manufacturing and technology sectors have expanded because international investors view Canada as an attractive gateway to the larger U.S. market.

But President Donald Trump has called Nafta the ""worst trade deal ever made"" and forced a renegotiation after his inauguration in January 2017. Since then, Canadian and U.S. policy makers have become increasingly pessimistic about the future of an agreement that has underpinned Canada's economic relationship with its southern neighbor since 1994.

""I think that regulatory uncertainty in general, including Nafta, will create headwinds for M&A markets,"" said Jason Rowe, chief executive of Goldman Sachs Canada.

Donald Walker, chief executive at Aurora, Ontario-based auto-parts maker Magna International Inc., one of the country's largest manufacturers, predicts large investments in Canada will either pause or flow south until the Nafta question is resolved.

""I think anybody that is contemplating any big investments over the long term is probably either waiting, or they're going to be biased to invest more in the U.S. until there's an outcome here,"" said Mr. Walker in a November call with analysts. ""I think we're just waiting to see what's going to happen.""

Canada's deal-making activity tends to be split between domestic deals for local targets and those aimed at international companies.

Overall deal value for 2017 as of Dec. 26 totaled $216.3 billion, roughly 14% lower than the $251.88 billion in 2016. That would still make 2017 one of only five years since 1995 when deal value passed the $200 billion mark, according to Dealogic.

Much of the activity inside Canada in 2017 was fueled by divestitures and restructurings in the oil-and-gas sector. Looking outside the borders, Canadian pension funds such as Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board added to their growing reputation as aggressive buyers of real estate and infrastructure.

Mr. Rowe's Goldman Sachs colleague, Luke Gordon, head of M&A for Canada, said mining and oil-and-gas companies could continue to be attractive targets for Asian and European companies, despite concerns about Nafta, while U.S. private-equity funds awash in capital may turn north as they search for investments.

Goldman advised Bolton, Ontario-based industrial equipment maker Husky Injection Molding Systems Ltd. in December, when private-equity firms Berkshire Partners LLC and Omers Private Equity Inc. sold it to Platinum Equity Partners of Los Angeles for $3.9 billion.

""It's good to see a recovery in domestic M&A,"" said Grant Kernaghan, who is responsible for Citigroup's M&A business in Canada. Mr. Kernaghan expects more activity in the mining sector, which has been moribund for years as prices for metals dropped but are now seeing some recovery. He said Canada's burgeoning financial technology sector could be attractive for those looking to expand their technology capability, while Canada's big banks could remain on the hunt internationally.

Citigroup advised Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA on its $2.2 billion sale of its Chilean subsidiary to Bank of Nova Scotia in November.

It is likely that a larger share of deal flow will start streaming out of Canada, as multinationals eye the impact of a U.S. tax overhaul that lowered corporate rates to 21%, lower than Canada's 26.5% rate. That could exaggerate a trend of growing Canadian companies looking outside the country as they seek to expand further, said Peter Buzzi, head of M&A in Canada for RBC Capital Markets.

The bank advised construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. in its $2.7 billion purchase of U.K.-based WS Atkins PLC in April.

While there has been a lot of talk of Canada's growing technology sector, the country is still a resources-heavy economy, and M&A will reflect those fundamentals, said Jeremy Fraiberg, head of M&A of Canadian law firm Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP.

""As resources go, so does the Canadian deal-making economy,"" Mr. Fraiberg said."
Ctit Group,Year-End Review &amp;amp; Outlook (A Special Report): Markets &amp;amp; Finance --- Shares of U.S. Banks Extend Their Climb," Jan 2, 2018",1,"Washington extended a helping hand to banks in 2017, pushing stocks in the sector higher for a second year in a row.

President Donald Trump's election in late 2016 prompted a surge in bank stocks on hopes that a tax overhaul and deregulation would help profits. Now, the tax and regulatory changes are finally happening, and they are proving a potent antidote to persistently low long-term interest rates, subdued trading activity and slowing loan growth.

Investors have grown increasingly confident banks' bottom lines will be huge beneficiaries of a lower tax rate. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index rose 16% in 2017. Although shy of the 19% gain for the S&P 500, the advance puts the bank index's total increase since the 2016 presidential election at 42%. Nearly all of the 2017 bank gains occurred in the last four months of the year when new tax legislation gained steam.

""Investors were first concerned, and then got enthused over rates, revenues and regulation,"" said Mike Mayo, a bank analyst at Wells Fargo & Co.

For much of 2017, bank shares struggled to build on their postelection gains. The passage of tax-code changes seemed questionable after health-care legislation efforts failed and stubbornly low long-term interest rates continued to weigh on profits. But investors became more optimistic when tax-overhaul efforts started to seem more likely in the fall.

Banks in the U.S. tend to pay relatively high tax rates, so they are expected to benefit from the planned cut in the corporate rate. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts estimated in December that the measures, which include a 21% corporate tax rate, would boost large bank earnings by about 13% in 2018.

Bank executives said they expect additional benefits from the plan. The tax changes will be ""good for the economy, good for job creation and wage growth and all good things will come from that,"" JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said in December. Many big banks, however, will first have to take a one-time hit to earnings from the changes.

Also boosting banks is the arrival of new Trump administration appointees in Washington. Bankers were eager for an end to the tough regulatory scrutiny of the Obama era, which led to higher compliance costs and major fines.

In recent months, regulators have started to grant banks a number of the changes they have long sought, opening the door to giving more details of annual Federal Reserve stress tests in advance and revising guidelines that limited some kinds of business lending.

Federal Reserve rate increases, which continued in mid-December, also helped profits by enabling banks to earn more on loans.

Bank of America Corp., the second largest in the U.S. by assets, in the third quarter posted its highest quarterly profit in six years. Analysts predict the bank will post annual profit records in 2018 and 2019.

Now, the question is whether bank stocks can sustain gains for a third year in a row and regain the record level they set before the financial crisis.

Since a slight decline in 2015, the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index has rallied to within 12% of its record from February 2007. But challenging trading, lending and interest-rate conditions could stop the index from reclaiming that level in 2018.

Bank of America, Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan all have said they expect trading revenue to log a decline in the fourth quarter due to low volatility. Another difficulty is the slowing pace of loan growth. Loans grew 4.1% from a year earlier near the end of December, down from 7.3% before the election, according to the Federal Reserve. Growth for business loans has been particularly weak, despite the stronger economy.

And although banks have benefited from the Fed's tightening, which involves a key short-term interest rate, longer-term rates have remained low, threatening future profits. The difference, or spread, between 10-year and two-year U.S. Treasury debt, a rough proxy for bank profitability, stood at about 0.5 percentage point at the end of December, near its lowest level in a decade.

This ""flattening"" yield curve will become a bigger issue if banks feel more pressure to pay customers a higher rate on their deposits. If loan balances aren't growing briskly and the interest-rate spread is narrow, it is far tougher for banks to increase lending profits.

Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg projects that lending profit margins will rise in 2018, but not as much as they did in 2017.

The flatter yield curve, he says, ""will matter at some point."""
Ctit Group,U.S. News: Bountiful 2017 Left Wall Street Traders in Cold," Dec 30, 2017",1,"Markets boomed in 2017, but Wall Street didn't share in the bounty.

At big banks, a quiet December closes what turned out to be an unremarkable year for trading, a lifeblood of large firms. Lower revenues likely mean slim bonuses for many traders and, in some cases, further cuts to the business, executives and consultants say.

The bleak end was in sharp contrast to the way 2017 started. The 2016 U.S. presidential election, a long-awaited rise in interest rates and contested elections across Europe jolted markets alive early in the year.

Stock markets continued to rise throughout the year -- the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a new high 71 times. But stocks, bonds, currencies and other assets traded in such a calm manner that it reduced demand for skilled traders and made it harder to profit.

Executives at JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. in recent weeks predicted their fourth-quarter trading revenues would fall by about 15% from a year earlier. That would imply full-year declines of 5% to 10% for the three firms, whose trading revenues totaled $50 billion in 2016, about one-fifth of their firmwide revenue.

At the 10 largest global banks, trading revenue was down 5% through the first nine months of the year. Revenue fell 2% in stock trading and 7% in fixed income, a larger business that includes corporate and government debt, currencies, commodities, products linked to interest rates and other instruments.

""No one is immune,"" said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities, an investment bank.

It is the latest ignominy for Wall Street traders who have seen their ranks, compensation and clout dwindle since the financial crisis. New regulations have curbed risk taking, while electronic trading has moved into once-opaque corners of the market ruled by brokers, bringing transparency to prices and slashing profits.

Meanwhile, investor dollars continue to flow into passive index funds, which trade in smaller amounts and negotiate hard on fees. ""Anybody who's realistic knows this is a different world than it was eight or 10 years ago,"" said Alan Johnson, a consultant who advises banks on their compensation.

The average trader's compensation will likely fall 7% when bonuses are doled out in January, according to the Options Group, a Wall Street headhunter. The cuts are likely to be deepest in areas like stock trading, where machines now do the work of thousands of brokers.

A year ago, hopes were high. The U.K. vote to leave the European Union sparked trading in the British pound and European interest rates and government debt. Trading surged again on the back of President Donald Trump's surprise victory. Trading revenue at the five biggest U.S. banks rose 4% in 2016.

Banks hustled to staff their trading desks for what many believed was a revival in Wall Street's fortunes. Early in 2017, London trading desks offered raises of up to 30% to poach interest-rate experts from rivals, according to Jessica Lee of Options Group.

But 2017 offered fewer macroeconomic shocks. ""There haven't been that many catalysts,"" JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said this month.

Nothing seemed to jolt markets. Investors shrugged at one jarring headline after another, from escalating nuclear tensions with North Korea to the widening probe into the White House's connections to Russia.

Trading activity in U.S. Treasurys between Dec. 1 and Dec. 22 was 8% lower than a year ago, according to JMP Securities, despite an interest-rate increase from the Federal Reserve on Dec. 13.

One measure of stock-market volatility, known as the VIX, hit new lows in December.

This month, Jefferies LLC, a smaller broker-dealer whose fiscal year ends Nov. 30, reported a 37% decline in fixed-income revenue that more than washed out a 10% rise in equities-trading revenue. Overall trading revenue fell 11%, versus a 27% rise in investment banking, which includes fees from underwriting and merger advisory.

Investment banking, the province of well-heeled boardroom bankers, thrived in 2017. The market for initial public offerings heated up after a slow 2016. Companies also took advantage of low interest rates to issue bonds, and the merger boom rolled on.

Options Group estimates investment bankers' pay will rise 10% this year, teeing up compensation tugs of war within banks and providing fresh tinder for the rivalry between Wall Street's two tribal factions."
Ctit Group,"Goldman Takes Big Charge on Tax Plan --- Bank faces a one-time $5 billion earnings hit, but long-term benefits from law are expected"," Dec 30, 2017",1,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said Friday it would take a $5 billion earnings charge related to the recent tax overhaul, a one-time jolt expected to be followed by a longer-term windfall from lower rates.

Companies from Wall Street to the heartland are wrestling with the immediate implications of the most sweeping changes to the nation's tax code in three decades. Goldman's announcement, which sets up its first quarterly loss in six years, also hints of broader turbulence coming to U.S. corporate earnings in the new year.

Under one estimate, companies in the S&P 500 index could be forced to take tax-related earnings charges of $235 billion -- about 1% of their combined market value.

The charge will swing Goldman to a quarterly loss and wipe out much of its full-year profit. But the firm, like its brethren on Wall Street and across much of corporate America, will be a winner in the long run as it enjoys the lowest U.S. corporate tax rate in eight decades and gets new flexibility in how it funds itself, invests in the business and returns capital to shareholders.

""They will make this back and then some,"" said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities. ""Tax reform is a positive for Goldman Sachs.""

Goldman shares fell less than 1%. Analysts had expected the firm to take a tax-related earnings hit of between $3 billion and $6 billion.

About two-thirds of the impact, or $3 billion, is related to a newly enacted, one-time tax on U.S. companies' overseas earnings.

Goldman had $31 billion parked offshore at the end of 2016, much of it in cash that will now be subject to a one-time tax of 15%.

Zion Research Group estimates that S&P 500 companies will book quarterly hits of $235 billion in the coming weeks on the $2.8 trillion they have amassed in foreign operations.

Drugmakers and technology firms, whose mazes of global intellectual-property arrangements rely heavily on subsidiaries in low-tax countries, account for 69% of the total.

Just five companies -- Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Pfizer Inc., Oracle Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. -- account for one-third, according to Zion's estimates.

Most large tech companies will take ""a big hit"" to their coming earnings, said Edward Kleinbard, a tax professor at the University of Southern California law school.

One exception, he said, is Apple, which has already recorded tax charges for a large portion of its overseas earnings.

Drugmaker Amgen Inc., which has nearly $40 billion parked abroad, said last week that it expects to incur a tax expense of at least $6 billion because of the new law.

Firms in these sectors may see their long-term tax rates rise, too. But they will gain flexibility: Many high-technology companies have twisted themselves into fiscal knots to avoid paying taxes on overseas cash, including loading up on debt at home and putting off domestic investments.

Some companies are sharing the bounty with employees. AT&T Inc., Comcast Corp. and Bank of America Corp. are granting one-time bonuses of $1,000.

Booking those expenses before year-end would let the companies deduct the costs under their old, higher rates, saving millions.

In a similar move, Goldman will deliver some stock compensation owed to top executives a few weeks early in order to generate tax savings for the firm, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The bank expects to save $140 million by delivering stock to about 300 employees in high-tax states like New York and California, the person said.

Ordinarily those shares, which were earned in prior years, would be delivered next month.

Shareholders are likely to benefit, too.

By removing incentives to park cash overseas, the new tax law frees up billions of dollars that could go toward buybacks and dividends for investors.

One study found that in 2004, when American companies got a chance to bring foreign cash home at lower tax rates, 94 cents of every repatriated dollar was returned to shareholders.

""It's a major windfall of cash,"" said Alethia Young, a Credit Suisse Group AG biotech analyst.

Meanwhile, Goldman will also write down the value of deferred tax assets, which are past losses and other items that can be used to defray future tax bills. Goldman has about $5 billion of these credits, which are less valuable going forward because the corporate tax rate will be lower.

Deferred-tax assets aren't unique to banks, but Wall Street firms racked up huge losses during the financial crisis and so tend to have a lot of them.

Citigroup Inc. has said it would take a $20 billion earnings charge from writing down its $46 billion of deferred-tax assets as well as for taxes assessed on its overseas profits.

Bank of America expects to take a $3 billion hit on its $19 billion stash, while Credit Suisse and Barclays PLC have announced smaller charges in recent days.

In the long run, though, Wall Street firms will be among the biggest beneficiaries of the new tax system. The law, signed last week by President Donald Trump, reduces the headline corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, its lowest level since 1939.

Banks are relatively high taxpayers because they get fewer of the breaks, such as for research and development, that are available to technology or pharmaceutical companies. So they benefit more from the rate reduction.

Goldman has averaged a 30% tax rate over the past three years, and JMP's Mr. Ryan estimates an earnings benefit of 5% to 10% a year going forward. Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman said in June that a 25% corporate tax rate -- higher than it ultimately landed -- would lift his bank's earnings by 15% a year."
Ctit Group,Banks Get Waivers for Retirement Business," Dec 29, 2017",1,"WASHINGTON -- Five global banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., can continue managing corporate retirement plans in the wake of recent guilty pleas to criminal charges, under new waivers announced by the Trump administration on Thursday.

The waivers, set by the Labor Department, are the latest fallout of the banks' criminal convictions in market-manipulation schemes, which the firms collectively paid billions of dollars to settle inrecent years. Without the waivers, the banks' asset-management units would have been disqualified from managing retirement plans under U.S. law, even though the misconduct in question occurred in other areas of each of the banks.

The relief allows each of the firms to continue managing pension plans and individual-retirement accounts.

The waivers also apply to units of Barclays PLC, UBS Group AG and Deutsche Bank AG.

The Obama administration, in its waning days, approved one-year waivers for each of the banks and proposed granting the firms five-year reprieves from the restrictions.

Thursday's move by the Trump administration completes those longer-term waivers, though it struck a tougher posture than its predecessors: Two of the banks, Deutsche Bank and UBS, will only receive three-year waivers. The administration said that it shortened the waivers for those two firms because they had more than one criminal conviction.

Spokesmen for J.P. Morgan, Barclays and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Spokesmen for UBS and Citigroup didn't respond to a request for comment."
Ctit Group,Economic Surprise Index Hits a High," Dec 28, 2017",1,"The U.S. economy is ending the year on a high note, but that might not be a good sign for stocks.

Economic data are beating expectations by the most in nearly six years, according to a gauge compiled by Citigroup Inc. The bank's U.S. economic surprise index was at 84.5 last week, its highest since the beginning of 2011, and near those levels this week. The further above zero the index is, the more readings on the economy that are coming in better than economists' forecasts. The further below zero, the more the numbers are missing expectations.

The index was in negative territory as recently as September. Its massive run higher is one sign that the economy has gained momentum this year. The U.S. is now having the best sustained growth in three years. Manufacturing data continue to come in strong. And the U.S. continues to add jobs at a brisk clip.

A robust economy typically goes along with a rising stock market. The strengthening economy and corporate earnings growth have helped send the S&P 500 up 20% this year.

But the Citi index by its nature can't stay at such lofty heights. Better data typically cause economists to lift their forecasts. Eventually, the expectations get high enough that the data can't stay ahead of what economists are predicting. When data start missing expectations, the index turns negative.

""Even if the recovery remains healthy in 2018, it can't continue to surprise,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, in a note to clients. ""The current economic surprise index is higher than 99.6% of the readings since January 2003.""

Mr. Paulsen notes that the high readings on the index may mean lower returns over the next few months. When the Citi index is above 70, the S&P 500 has had annualized returns of 2.75% over the next six months, according to data going back to 2003.

The stock market usually does best when expectations are moderate enough that economic data can comfortably beat them, encouraging traders to load up on stocks. When expectations get high, though, the data aren't likely to be strong enough to keep the stock market rising as fast as it has been."
Ctit Group,Tax Plan Likely to Boost Dollar --- Repatriation of profits is expected to bolster the currency -- but how long will rally last?," Dec 26, 2017",1,"A provision of the tax overhaul is expected to release a tide of U.S. corporate cash from abroad, a development likely to jolt the dollar and reverberate throughout financial markets early next year.

Companies could bring back as much as $400 billion, according to one estimate, as they take advantage of a one-time cut for repatriation of earnings and cash held overseas written into the GOP tax overhaul. That typically requires them to sell foreign holdings and buy assets denominated in dollars, which could boost the U.S. currency.

Gauging the dollar's trajectory is crucial to both investors and corporations. The currency's climb over the past several years has been blamed for pressuring profits among U.S. multinational companies and making exporters' goods less competitive abroad.

Its trajectory also influences prices for raw materials like oil, copper and gold, which are denominated in dollars and become more expensive to foreign investors when the dollar rises.

Many investors expected the dollar to strengthen in 2017, boosted by the Trump administration's fiscal-stimulus and infrastructure-spending pledges. Instead, the currency as of Friday had fallen nearly 7% against its peers, as key White House initiatives stalled.

""There should be some kind of boost to the dollar"" from the tax plan, said Lee Ferridge, head of macrostrategy for North America at State Street Global Markets. ""But I will be using that as a selling opportunity.""

Some analysts said such a rally could mark a climax for the dollar's nearly seven-year-long bull market, as monetary policy begins to tighten in other developed economies. Many expect more central banks around the world to start unwinding nearly a decade of postcrisis stimulus measures in 2018, a process already under way in the U.S. As central banks begin normalizing interest-rate levels, the dollar may become less appealing to some investors, who for years had sought U.S. assets because they offered yields that were high compared with other developed economies.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas and RBC Capital Markets all believe the dollar will start 2018 stronger, according to forecasts released in the last several weeks. Out of those banks, however, only analysts at RBC predict the currency will hold those gains into year-end.

There is less agreement among analysts on how much of the more than $1 trillion U.S. companies are estimated to have stashed abroad will be converted into dollars under the new tax law and what part of that amount is already in the U.S. currency. That makes it difficult to gauge how the tax bill will affect the dollar, or what impact the repatriations will have on the economy.

A tax-repatriation holiday enacted under the administration of George W. Bush in late 2004 prompted companies to bring in $312 billion, according to the Internal Revenue Service. The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, broke a yearslong downtrend to rise nearly 13% in 2005, a move analysts attributed to cash flowing in the U.S. The S&P 500, which includes many multinationals, rose 3% -- a smaller gain than in either of the two previous years.

This time around, repatriations could total between $200 billion and $400 billion, Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates. The firm expects the euro to fall to $1.10 against the dollar in the first quarter of 2018 from around $1.1862 on Friday.

Atul Lele, chief investment officer at Deltec International Group, which oversees $5 billion, said repatriation will create demand for U.S. dollars, driving the currency higher. He also expects the tax cuts to juice U.S. growth and stimulate inflation, inducing the Federal Reserve to raise rates at a faster clip. Higher rates tend to boost the dollar, as they make the U.S. currency more attractive to investors seeking yield.

Mr. Lele owns shares of U.S. financials such as Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co., which he believes will benefit from stronger growth. He has also increased his dollar holdings to counterbalance assets he owns that are denominated in other currencies and would decline in value if the dollar strengthened.

The tax plan is likely to have ramifications for the broader markets as well, some analysts said. Analysts at UBS Wealth Management said the legislation could provide the ""icing on the cake"" for an economy that is already going strong, contributing as much as 8% to corporate profits and a further upside of 5% to the S&P 500.

BMO Capital Markets cut its 2018 gold forecast by 1.5% to an average price of $1,280 a troy ounce to account for potential headwinds from a stronger dollar. The metal settled Friday at $1275.40 a troy ounce.

The most immediate threat to a dollar rally, however, could come from outside the U.S., where a burgeoning eurozone economy is paving the way for the European Central Bank to unwind its monetary-easing policies and eventually raise rates. That would be a boon for investors who have wanted to diversify their dollar holdings but have stayed out of euros because interest rates in the region are currently near historical lows. The euro was up nearly 13% against the dollar this year as of Friday, and investors expect that rally to continue into 2018.

""We are positioned for the dollar to be a little stronger, and then we expect to lighten up on dollars in favor of euros,"" said Nick Gartside, international chief investment officer of fixed income at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. He expects the euro to rise as high as $1.30 against the dollar by the end of 2018.

The shift is one that likely spells the end for the dollar's yearslong rally, during which the U.S. currency has appreciated more than 30% against its peers, said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income. The dollar has appreciated more than 30% against its peers from its lows of 2011.

""You had a gigantic bull market in the dollar in recent years, but now the tide is turning,"" Mr. Tipp said."
Ctit Group,World News: Saudis Free Suspects Held in Crackdown --- The recent releases suggest high-profile targets are agreeing to settlements," Dec 26, 2017",0,"The Saudi government in recent days has released at least two dozen high-profile suspects held in a wide-ranging crackdown on corruption, a sign that those accused of illegally amassing wealth are increasingly agreeing to settle as authorities push to expedite the investigation process.

Among those released in the past week is Ibrahim al-Assaf, a former finance minister and board member of the state oil giant Saudi Aramco, who was accused of embezzlement related to the expansion of Mecca's Grand Mosque and taking advantage of his position, people familiar with the matter said Sunday.

Others released include former assistant minister of finance Mohammed bin Homoud Al Mazyed, Saoud al-Daweesh, former chief executive of Saudi Telecom, Prince Turki bin Khalid, and Mohy Saleh Kamel, a businessman, the people said. None of the suspects freed could be reached to comment.

""They all settled to get out,"" a senior adviser to the Saudi government said. ""At least two dozens were released if not more."" He added that ""we will see more getting released soon and court trials for those who want to clear their names. The government want this over sooner than later.""

Representatives for the Saudi government didn't respond to requests to comment.

The anticorruption campaign began in early November and has swept up more than 200 people, including senior government officials, prominent businessmen and members of the ruling family, many of whom have been confined to the opulent Ritz-Carlton hotel in western Riyadh.

The investigation is being led by a newly established anticorruption agency headed by the kingdom's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who is pushing to overhaul Saudi Arabia's oil-dependent economy as well as its conservative society.

The detainees, who face accusations that range from procurement fraud to money laundering and bribery, were given the option by Saudi authorities of relinquishing part of their wealth in exchange for freedom rather than going to court.

The government already freed in the past month several of those arrested after they agreed to surrender a part of their assets.

That included Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, the most politically influential royal detained in the campaign who was once seen as a leading contender to the throne, after he agreed to pay more than $1 billion to settle corruption allegations against him. Prince Miteb couldn't be reached to comment.

The antigraft campaign has largely been welcomed in Saudi Arabia, where many people are angry at what they see as rampant corruption among the wealthy.

It has helped burnish Prince Mohammed's popular image as a champion of fairness, though some analysts and observers outside the kingdom see the crackdown as part of a centralization of power in the hands of the young crown prince. He became next in line to the throne this summer.

The release of some detainees has also been cheered on social media, irking others.

It isn't clear how many people are still detained as part of the government crackdown. Other high-profile detainees who remain at the Ritz include billionaire tycoon Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, a major investor in companies including Citigroup Inc. and Apple Inc. through his firm Kingdom Holding Co., and Adel Fakieh, who until he was detained was Saudi Arabia's economy minister.

Saudi authorities are demanding at least $6 billion from Prince al-Waleed to free him from detention, people familiar with the matter said, potentially putting the global business empire of one of the world's richest men at risk.

Prince al-Waleed is talking with the government about instead accepting as payment for his release a large piece of Kingdom Holding, people familiar with the matter said."
Ctit Group,BofA Will Dole Out Tax-Related Bonuses," Dec 23, 2017",0,"Bank of America Corp. is giving $1,000 bonuses tied to the tax-overhaul bill to more than half of its employees, making the bank the latest company to announce such a perk since the legislation passed this week.

By the end of the year, the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank plans to give the one-time bonuses to employees who earn up to $150,000 a year in total compensation, according to an internal memo from Chief Executive Brian Moynihan reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. About 145,000 employees will get the perk, the memo said. The bank employs 210,000 people.

The tax legislation, signed by President Donald Trump on Friday, includes a large cut in the corporate tax rate, which is expected to significantly boost profits, especially for banks. Telecoms and banks are among those expected to get a huge boost from the overhaul because most of their operations are domestic and they pay higher effective rates than firms in sectors such as pharmaceuticals or technology, which have intellectual property or operations outside the country. Following the bill's passage, a number of companies announced plans to share that windfall, at least in part, with employees.

AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp. said they would pay a $1,000 bonus to most of their U.S. workers, more than 300,000 people combined.

Other banks have also announced pay increases since the tax bill passed Congress. Wells Fargo & Co., PNC Financial Services Group Inc., BB&T Corp. and Fifth Third Bancorp said they would raise their minimum wage to $15 an hour. Bank of America already pays its employees that minimum wage. Some of those banks are also paying certain employees a one-time bonus similar to Bank of America's.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts estimated in December that the measures, which include a 21% corporate tax rate, would boost large bank earnings by about 13% in 2018.

Some banks will, however, have to take a one-time hit to profits from writing down what are called deferred tax assets. These are created by losses, in many cases huge ones racked up during the financial crisis, and act as IOUs that can be used to offset future tax bills. They will lose value due to the tax changes.

On Friday, Bank of America said in a filing that it would take a one-time hit to profits of roughly $3 billion in the fourth quarter because of the tax legislation, largely from the deferred tax asset write-down. That amount was expected.

Citigroup Inc. in early December said it would take about a $20 billion hit to profits from the version of the tax bills initially passed by Congress."
Ctit Group,EU Aims to Deter Brexit Arbitrage," Dec 20, 2017",1,"The European Central Bank should take charge of regulating big investment banks in the eurozone, according to a proposal to be presented by the European Commission. The effort is the latest move to stop individual European countries from luring banks with the promise of looser rules in the wake of Brexit.

Banks' European broker-dealer operations are overseen by a patchwork of national authorities. The commission, the European Union's executive arm, wants to forestall local regulators from offering sweeteners to entice large investment banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. as they search for new EU bases after the U.K. exits the trading bloc in March 2019.

The proposed rule is expected to be presented Wednesday, a person familiar with the matter said. It will be subject to approval by EU countries and lawmakers, according to officials.

On Monday, the ECB said it would pay special attention to banks' Brexit plans to ensure they don't just set up shell companies in the euro area. Bankers want to keep as much as possible in London after Brexit to avoid having to create duplicate offices in Europe. But ECB officials want guarantees that the new European hubs are well capitalized and have compliance staff on site.

Privately, authorities in some EU countries have shown relief that the ECB is ready to step in, citing better preparedness of the central bank to deal with complex investment-banking issues over domestic regulators.

If the commission proposal is approved, the definition of credit institutions supervised by the ECB may have to be enlarged to include the investment banks, which don't take deposits and lend like regular banks, according to an opinion issued by the ECB last month. Current rules state that among other things, banks with over 30 billion euros ($35.35 billion) of assets are directly overseen by the ECB.

The ECB has already taken a hard line, demanding that banks move substantial numbers of staff and capital into their European hubs. It has also been less inclined than local regulators to let banks flip risk back into their London entities in the years right after Brexit, a move that would reduce the amount of capital they have to shift into their EU offices.

""We will oppose any race to the bottom in supervisory standards,"" Sabine Lautenschlager, vice chairman of the ECB's banking supervisor arm, has said.

The ECB has played tough cop before. In 2014, it took over regulation of eurozone banks to address fears local regulators were too relaxed with their lenders and missed problems that ultimately caused some to collapse during the financial crisis. At times, however, the institution has been accused of overstepping its remit.

In October, its plan to require banks to fully provision for unsecured new loans deemed nonperforming faced a backlash by European lawmakers, who said legislators, not technocrats, should make the rules. While the EU has been moving forward with a banking and capital markets union, Brexit has created a sense of urgency.

Several investment banks have signaled they will set up enlarged offices outside London amid expectations that they will lose the right to serve customers across the Continent from the U.K. Citigroup Inc., Nomura Holdings Inc. and Morgan Stanley are setting up hubs in Frankfurt, while Goldman Sachs has chosen both the German city and Paris."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: No 'Deficiencies' In Bailout Plans," Dec 20, 2017",1,"The eight largest and most complex U.S. banks avoided a major rebuke on their latest ""living will"" bailout-prevention plans, a milestone that further reduces the already-remote possibility that any of the firms would be broken up by the government.

U.S. regulators said the eight firms, including Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co., didn't have ""deficiencies"" in plans documenting how they could go bankrupt without needing a taxpayer bailout.

That was a reversal from April 2016, when the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. shocked the firms by determining five of eight had deficiencies.

The regulators' 2016 decision had raised the possibility of bank breakups. If regulators find deficiencies in the firms' plans, the 2010 Dodd-Frank law empowers them to impose significant sanctions and, eventually, force divestitures. The idea was that regulators would use the power if they determined big banks were ""too big to fail."" Tuesday's verdict, rendered by two agencies still led by appointees of the Obama administration, shows that is highly unlikely. Trump administration appointees who take over the regulators in the coming months are expected to be less inclined to crack down on big banks.

The test Congress set out in Dodd-Frank is severe: Big banks have to show they have credible plans to collapse and go through the U.S. bankruptcy process without any taxpayer help.

That is a tall task to imagine for firms with such massive footprints. Bank of America alone has about $2.25 trillion in assets. The failure of a firm that size could easily send financial markets into a panic, as occurred when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in 2008."
Ctit Group,Steinhoff's Margin Loan Went Really Wrong for Banks," Dec 20, 2017",1,"Lending to the wealthy against equity holdings is rated as surprisingly low-risk by banks. But when it goes wrong, it goes really wrong. Just look at scandal-hit Steinhoff International.

A 1.6 billion euro ($1.9 billion) share-backed loan to Steinhoff's recently departed chairman, Christo Wiese, is so far underwater that the banks will need a bathysphere to recover any value. Shares in the global retail group, which owns the Mattress Firm retail chain and the Sleepy's brand, collapsed suddenly when the company disclosed accounting irregularities this month.

Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and Nomura put together the original loan, but have since sold off large chunks to several other banks including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which has the largest exposure, and BNP Paribas.

The losses may be a small part of the banks' overall businesses, but they look big enough that for many of the lenders they could wipe out all revenue from stock-based lending this year. It is a business that had been booming due to the long, low-volatility stock rally and the loans' light capital requirements. Regulators assess margin lending on liquid, public equities as less risky than mortgages.

This loan was made to a vehicle controlled by Mr. Wiese in September 2016 to help him fund a Steinhoff capital raising needed to pay for one of its many acquisitions. Mr. Wiese's vehicles pledged 628 million shares -- at that point worth 3.175 billion euros -- as collateral against the loan. In essence, he borrowed against his Steinhoff shares to buy more Steinhoff shares.

The losses these lenders face are so large because the downfall came so suddenly. Normally banks can make margin calls, asking for cash or more stock, to protect their position. With Steinhoff, the shares were worth 120% of the loan on Dec. 5 and less than 24% 48 hours later. They are now valued at less than 20%.

Lenders have recovered a fraction of the value by selling 98 million, or 15%, of the pledged shares last week. Banks, which met with management Tuesday, are now trying to figure how to salvage as much of their investments as possible.

The end could come quickly. Steinhoff said its lenders were already freezing or withdrawing credit lines from its subsidiaries.

This will be a fascinating game in which each bank has to judge whether the best value lies in cooperating with their client and peers or acting aggressively to recover what it can quickly. Right now it is hard to see the game producing any winners."
Ctit Group,Stocks Jump on Tax-Overhaul Hopes," Dec 19, 2017",1,"U.S. stocks climbed to records Monday, pushing the Nasdaq Composite above 7000 for the first time in intraday trading, as investors extended bets on lawmakers pushing through major tax overhaul.

Stock prices recently have been moving in line with the likelihood of a Republican tax plan being signed into law. Deals with wavering lawmakers late last week left Republicans ready to pass their bill as soon as Tuesday.

A corporate tax cut could help boost company profits and keep the long U.S. stock rally going, investors and analysts say, even as some have expressed concerns about valuations looking stretched.

""It is like a steroid shot in the arm for the U.S. market,"" said Alex Dryden, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 140.46 points, or 0.6%, to 24792.20, posting its 70th record close of 2017 -- the most closing highs for the index in a single calendar year.

The S&P 500 rose 14.35 points, or 0.5%, to 2690.16, and the Nasdaq Composite added 58.18 points, or 0.8%, to 6994.76. Earlier in the day, the Nasdaq rose as high as 7003.89.

Shares of companies thought to be among the biggest beneficiaries of a corporate tax cut jumped Monday, lifting major indexes.

Bank stocks climbed, with shares of Goldman Sachs Group, Bank of America and Citigroup each adding more than 1%.

The SPDR S&P Retail ETF added 2.7%, with Monro, Abercrombie & Fitch and Guess among the biggest gainers in the group.

Monro rose $5.25, or 10%, to $57.60 Abercrombie & Fitch added 1.12, or 6.7%, to 17.83, while Guess added 1.01, or 6.2%, to 17.26.

Shares of smaller-capitalization companies also rose, sending the Russell 2000 up 1.2%.

Banks, retailers and smaller U.S. companies generally tend to pay high effective tax rates, analysts say.

Meanwhile, government bonds and their stock-market proxies pulled back.

Utility stocks, which many investors consider bondlike because of their relatively hefty dividends, fell 1.2% in the S&P 500.

Some investors and analysts cautioned that it would be difficult to predict just how much the economy will benefit from a tax overhaul.

""This is a complicated bill and there are bound to be some unintended consequences,"" said Dave Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management. He said that, if the bill passes, he will be monitoring changes in key data like retail sales and corporate profits to gauge its effect.

Even so, Mr. Donabedian said, the outlook for stocks in 2018 looks positive, given the pickup in growth around the world.

""This is a powerful rally that one would probably be wise not to get in the way of,"" he said.

Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 climbed 1.2%, boosted by broad gains across sectors.

In the Asia-Pacific region, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average broke its four-day losing streak to close 1.5% higher, boosted by gains in shares of financial companies. At midday Tuesday, the Nikkei was up less than 0.1%."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Leveraged Lending Makes a Comeback," Dec 19, 2017",0,"Banks are ramping up a business that was popular before the financial crisis: offering investors ways to lever up sometimes illiquid and complex investments to amplify their returns.

Years of ultralow interest rates have pushed down returns across markets, making such strategies increasingly appealing to funds in Europe and the U.S.

A decade ago, overleveraged banks and investors nearly crashed the global financial system.

While leverage is nowhere near those levels and new banking regulations restrict how high it can go, some bankers and funds are still concerned about signs of leverage creeping back into the system.

The level of leverage across debt markets can be hard to track given many transactions are private, but funds report that banks have been stepping up their efforts to lend to investors and they are increasingly saying yes.

Recently, several banks offered London-based Cheyne Capital's Strategic Value Credit unit finance to leverage a 300 million euros ($353.4 million) pool of loans to Irish midsize firms, potentially doubling the London-based fund's returns on that investment to roughly 12% to 15%.

Cheyne SVC Chief Investment Officer Anthony Robertson hadn't previously thought of using leverage but found the prospect of levering this niche investment by two times to be a tempting offer.

""In a world where rates are so anemic, investment-management funds desperately need to bolster returns,"" said Mr. Robertson, who hopes to close the deal in the new year. But ""clearly it does enhance the risk profile,"" he said.

Corporate bonds are trading near levels not seen before the financial crisis, when rampant demand for income pushed returns lower. Government bonds continue to offer low returns, with the 10-year Treasury note yielding 2.392% Monday.

Adding leverage can multiply gains when investments are steady or rising in value. Put simply, funds borrow to bet more money on an investment. But it also magnifies losses, sometimes ensnaring investors in a vicious circle in which they are forced to sell as prices fall, triggering further declines and more fire sales.

Funds say they are being offered leverage that would allow them to increase their investments in loans to large, highly indebted companies by up to four times.

Banks are also offering up to 10 times leverage on the highest-rated slices of collateralized loan obligations, products that carve up pools of risky loans. More esoteric investments such as bundles of midcap loans, real estate or troubled loans can get closer to two times leverage, they say.

""The most worrisome thing I see is people levering more credit,"" said David Allen, chief investment officer of AlbaCore Capital.

Mr. Allen said he is being offered leverage more frequently when he buys debt, though he prefers not to use it. ""It's like going to McDonald's and being offered french fries: It's always available,"" he said.

Providing leverage is a growth market for investment banks struggling with declines in traditional trading units. Fixed-income financing activities at the top 12 global investment banks are on course to increase 10% to 15% this year, according to analytics firm Coalition.

That has come as banks have increased their lending against a variety of debt securities, ranging from high-grade bonds to more complex instruments like asset-backed securities, said Amrit Shahani, research director at Coalition.

Bankers in JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s London office have discussed with investors options that would allow them to lever their whole fund roughly two times over, according to people familiar with the matter.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s disclosed plans in a September presentation to double by 2020 the size of its balance sheet dedicated to financing ""bespoke pools of collateral"" for its clients, from around $5 billion in 2016.

Other banks are wary. Citigroup Inc. has been financing fewer structured credit assets this year as competitors have been lending at ever lower rates, according to people familiar with the matter."
Ctit Group,It Is Time to Stop Talking About Bitcoin's Market Cap," Dec 12, 2017",1,"Bitcoin is taking over the world. Its rapidly rising value is making it bigger than some major financial companies, some big currencies and many of the world's countries. Or so the bitcoin cheerleaders say.

Bitcoin's market capitalization currently stands at around $278 billion, according to coinmarketcap.com. That puts it ahead of Citigroup Inc. and Visa Inc. and the gross domestic products of Finland and Greece.

These comparisons are dubious. Bitcoin's market cap is simply its current price in dollars, times the total number of bitcoins in circulation. But it makes little sense to compare this to the market capitalization of Citigroup or Visa, currently $201 billion and $255 billion, respectively. Market capitalization measures the equity value of a business, or what investors are willing to pay for its future profits. Bitcoin isn't a business and has no profits.

This comparison gives an exaggerated impression of bitcoin's relative size. For Citigroup, the more apt comparison would be to its total assets, which were $1.8 trillion at the end of September. For Visa, the more interesting comparison would probably be the amount of payments processed by the card network vs. bitcoin's blockchain. There are currently around 337,000 Bitcoin transactions a day, according to blockchain.info. Visa processed 468 million transactions a day in the three months through September.

Comparisons with national GDP figures are the equivalent of comparing two random numbers. Tallying up all of the timber and machinery that Finland produces in a year relative to the global value of existing bitcoins is meaningless.

What about major currencies? Total U.S. dollars in circulation amounted to $1.59 trillion as of Nov. 15, according to the Federal Reserve. But this is a very narrow measure of U.S. dollar supply, consisting primarily of physical notes. A broader measure of money supply called M3, which includes money-market funds, short-term repurchase agreements and other liquid assets, stood at $13.7 trillion at the end of September. Even this is likely too narrow, however, as it excludes a multitude of U.S.-dollar denominated assets. The U.S. economy's total assets in 2016 came to $220 trillion, according to Federal Reserve flow of funds data.

There is confusion over how to measure bitcoin because there is disagreement over whether it is a currency, a method of settling transactions or a speculative asset. Each would suggest a different benchmark. For now it is mostly just the latter. Beware of specious comparisons that overstate its importance."
Ctit Group,"Electric Cars Disrupt Metal Market --- Investors dive into commodities, companies likely to benefit from trend"," Dec 11, 2017",0,"A boom in electric vehicles is stoking demand for a wide range of metals, a shift some investors believe will have a far-reaching impact on commodity prices around the world.

Investors eager to get in early have doubled the price of lithium and cobalt -- key components of electric-car batteries -- in the past two years. Shares of companies that claim to sit on deposits of the metals have soared this year, too, even though some have yet to bring any production to market.

Many investors also have found fresh reasons to love some of the better-known metals, which are used more heavily in electric and hybrid vehicles than in ordinary cars. Prices for nickel, copper and other base metals have hit multiyear highs in 2017, although some have receded in recent weeks.

Meanwhile, analysts expect a host of minor metals such as manganese, vanadium and molybdenum to become more important in coming years.

It is a bet that coincides with Tesla Inc.'s soaring market value and the surge of bitcoin, the latest wager tied to disruptive technology with uncertain ramifications. As more countries pave the way for electric vehicles to supplant gasoline-powered ones, the most bullish investors are convinced the world is about to experience its biggest shift in commodities demand since the 19th century, when petroleum replaced whale oil as lamp fuel.

More skeptical observers see echoes of the late 1990s dot-com era, when most investors correctly predicted the internet would change the world, but few found the handful of companies that would survive the sector's brutal crash and thrive in the 21st century.

""We're at a tipping point where this next generation of commodities becomes more significant for industry and growth,"" said Maxwell Gold, director of investment strategy at ETF Securities.

However, ""it is so early in the process that it is difficult to determine who the winners and losers will be,"" he said.

As sales of electric vehicles ramp up, so will the need for a spectrum of metals that are used to make everything from batteries to wiring, some investors said.

Automotive demand for lithium is set to climb 35% each year through 2021, according to Citigroup Inc. projections.

Cobalt used in electric vehicles will increase roughly 450% from this year to 2025, Morgan Stanley said. Electric vehicles will become the second-largest nickel-consuming sector by that year, with demand rising nearly 10-fold, while copper demand for cars and infrastructure is also expected to grow steadily, a JPMorgan Chase & Co. forecast showed.

Ralph Aldis, director of research and fund manager at U.S. Global Investors, said he has picked up shares of several lithium producers for the firm's World Precious Minerals fund.

""I just know that's the direction that the world seems to be going, and I'm not going to fight it,"" Mr. Aldis said.

Shares of Lithium Americas Corp. have soared 202% this year on the Toronto Stock Exchange. First Cobalt Corp., which is exploring cobalt mines in Canada, has notched a 215% gain.

""People are following the money,"" said Trent Mell, chief executive of First Cobalt, which has yet to extract any cobalt and recently began drilling in a group of 50 mines that once produced cobalt and silver. ""I'm able to raise a lot of capital I wouldn't have been able to even a year ago.""

The gains have accompanied a surge in global electric and hybrid-vehicle sales, which rose 50% in the first 10 months of 2017 from the same period a year earlier, according to EV-Volumes, a research group that tracks electric-car sales.

And growth is expected to continue. Sales of electric and hybrid vehicles are slated to surge to 31.5 million units in 2035 from 1.2 million units in 2017, according to Jefferies Group.

Driving that growth is China, which will demand auto makers meet gradually escalating quotas for energy-efficient cars starting in 2019. The U.K. and France are set to phase out sales of diesel and gasoline vehicles by 2040, while India plans to sell only electric vehicles by 2030. In the U.S., auto makers are investing billions of dollars in electric vehicles despite expensive technology costs and lukewarm customer demand.

---

Plenty of Reasons

To Be Cautious

Some investors think the long-term losers from electric cars could include palladium and platinum, which are used to scrub emissions in gasoline and diesel engines.

Even perceived winners like cobalt could be vulnerable if battery companies find cheaper alternatives, a process some skeptics say has already started.

These analysts say there are plenty of other reasons to be cautious. Forecasts on the use of electric vehicles are vulnerable to many factors, from a slowdown in global growth to low gasoline prices, and it is difficult to predict how readily consumers will buy the vehicles when governments slash incentive programs. Tesla Inc.'s sales in Hong Kong came to a standstill in the month after authorities slashed a tax break for electric vehicles on April 1.

Higher metals prices also typically spur increased production, which eventually forces prices lower as supply floods the market.

""It's very speculative,"" said Nick Page, a global emerging-market analyst for asset-management firm Fiera Capital's European division. ""Everyone is jumping on this bandwagon because people are scared of missing out."" Mr. Page said his firm hasn't made investments based on electric-vehicle-related bets but is monitoring their adoption rate.

Other challenges include a sparse infrastructure of charging stations, needed to keep vehicles powered. Analysts say there is little chance oil will soon return to its 2014 level above $100 a barrel, keeping gasoline relatively inexpensive."
Ctit Group,"Currencies: JPMorgan, Others Put Off Bitcoin Futures"," Dec 8, 2017",1,"As investors rush into bitcoin, some big Wall Street banks are hitting the brakes.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the largest U.S. futures broker, will offer access but only for certain customers, a person familiar with the situation said. ABN Amro Group will be handling trades for ""a small selected group of professional clients,"" a spokeswoman for the Dutch bank said in an email. Morgan Stanley and Societe Generale SA are still evaluating their approach to bitcoin futures, other people said Thursday.

Banks play a key role in facilitating futures trades for hedge funds and other big trading firms. If they don't provide access to the new market, some of their customers might be unable to place bets on bitcoin futures.

The banks may change their minds and start offering the service. Still, their hesitation could put a damper on the hotly anticipated launch of bitcoin futures, which proponents see as a huge step forward in the evolution of the digital currency.

JPMorgan plans to assess the liquidity and volatility over the next few weeks and may provide access at some point, a person familiar with the matter said.

Cboe Global Markets Inc., a Chicago-based exchange operator, plans to open the first U.S. bitcoin futures market this weekend, less than 10 days after regulators gave it the green light -- a tight time-frame for many firms to get comfortable with the new product, market participants say. Cboe's larger crosstown rival, CME Group Inc., is set to launch a competing bitcoin futures market on Dec. 18.

A Cboe spokeswoman said Sunday's launch would go ahead as planned. The exchange declined to release a list of banks prepared to handle trading in its bitcoin futures, citing confidentiality.

Bitcoin smashed through the $16,000 mark on Thursday, only a day after passing $12,000, according to CoinDesk. It was trading at $968.23 at the start of the year.

The rapid increase has made it difficult for more buttoned-up Wall Street firms to ignore the digital currency, despite concerns over its uncertain legal status and links with illicit activity.

Now, banks are trying to catch up with surging investor interest, while managing the risks associated with bitcoin's volatility.

To access the futures market, a trader needs to open an account with a brokerage. The broker can be liable for losses if that trader's bets go wrong.

Many futures brokerages are grappling with how to handle the risks of bitcoin futures due to the volatility of the digital currency, brokers said.

Banks in their role as futures brokers act as a buffer to counterparties, so they are on the hook should their clients suffer losses they can't pay.

In assessing whether to support bitcoin futures, brokers need to evaluate their relationship with clients and figure out whether to charge higher amounts to backstop bitcoin futures trades -- an extraordinarily difficult task given bitcoin's volatility."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Citigroup Faces Big Hit As Result of Tax Shift," Dec 7, 2017",1,"Citigroup Inc. finance chief John Gerspach said Wednesday the bank is likely to take a hit of about $20 billion to profit under the tax plans recently passed by Congress.

The charge will result from the bank writing down the value of what are known as deferred tax assets as well as the impact of changes to rules regarding the repatriation to the U.S. of profit earned in other countries.

Mr. Gerspach's comments, made at a financial-services conference in New York, build on previous guidance given by the bank that tax-code changes could result in a hit of about $15 billion if the rate was cut to 25%.

Over the long term, though, any immediate hit to profit at Citigroup and other banks with these tax assets are likely to be offset by higher net income due to a lower tax rate.

Mr. Gerspach said that neither the charge nor a resulting $4 billion decline in the bank's regulatory capital would affect Citigroup's plan to return $60 billion to investors through 2020.

The lion's share of any charge at Citigroup -- $16 billion to $17 billion -- would come from writing down the value of the tax assets. These are akin to IOUs that can be used to pay future tax bills and are typically generated by previous losses.

Citigroup's massive losses during the financial crisis left it sitting on more than $40 billion in such deferred tax assets.

A lower tax rate reduces the value of those assets because the bank will have a lower tax bill that it can use them against."
Ctit Group,Wall Street Takes Aim At Market-Data Sales," Dec 7, 2017",1,"WASHINGTON -- Some of Wall Street's biggest banks, asset managers and high-speed trading firms have united in a battle over a shared adversary: stock exchanges and the profit they earn from selling market data.

A group of 24 firms -- including Morgan Stanley, Vanguard Group and Virtu Financial Inc. -- have asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to rein in prices that exchanges charge for data packages offering the most detail about market activity. In recent years, exchanges have sought to boost profits by slicing and dicing the torrent of electronic orders that pour through their systems.

The firms say the SEC should impose a rule forcing exchanges to reveal their profit margin for market-data products, as well as the number of clients that buy them. The SEC has taken a hands-off approach to exchanges' customized market-data products. Instead, it has focused on regulating the quality of the consolidated tape, a less complete picture of market activity that is generally shown to investors trading on retail brokerage platforms.

""For-profit exchanges enjoy an oligopoly over the dissemination and sale of market data,"" the firms say in their request, submitted to the SEC on Wednesday. An SEC spokesman declined to comment on the firms' request.

Securities laws require exchanges to distribute market data on terms that are ""fair and reasonable"" and nondiscriminatory. The group of brokers, traders and asset managers argue exchanges' published rules don't disclose enough to judge whether the price increases conform with legal standards.

""They tend to be rote descriptions of what the product is, the amount of the increase and a lot of boilerplate justification,"" said John Ramsay, chief market policy officer for IEX Group Inc., an exchange that doesn't sell its market data. IEX is one of the companies that signed the letter to the SEC.

Nasdaq, Cboe Global Markets Inc. and Intercontinental Exchange Inc., the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, have countered that market-data pricing is fair and that no trader is obligated to purchase faster and more comprehensive order data.

Some studies have found sizable increases in traders' market-data bills as exchanges introduced richer views of market data. A trader needing the fastest connection to the most detailed order data pays about $182,775 a month in 2017, up from $72,150 a month in 2012, according to Healthy Markets Association, a coalition of investment managers.

Wall Street brokers such as Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. have waged a legal battle with exchanges over market-data prices. In June, an SEC administrative law judge ruled for exchanges and against the brokers' trade association.

The brokers appealed the decision to the full three-member SEC, which hasn't ruled on the appeal.

The rule-making request also asks the SEC to require that exchanges disclose how much revenue they earn from the sale of consolidated-tape data, which only shows the latest trade and best current price for stocks.

Exchanges should also be required to seek public comment before they raise prices for consolidated-tape data, the letter says.

The SEC has rarely acted in recent years on rule-making requests filed by investors or companies. But brokers have won the support of the U.S. Treasury Department for their cause, a factor that could affect how the SEC responds. The Treasury Department recommended in October that the SEC scrutinize exchanges' market-data offerings more closely because the business ""is not fully competitive.""

The companies that signed the rule-making request also include Bloomberg LP, Citadel Securities, Citigroup Inc., E*Trade Financial Corp., Fidelity Investments, Hudson River Trading LLC, Charles Schwab Corp., TD Ameritrade Inc., T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and UBS Group AG."
Ctit Group,"Banking &amp;amp; Finance: AmEx, JPMorgan to Keep Marriott Cards"," Dec 6, 2017",1,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. and American Express Co. will remain credit-card issuers for the Marriott International Inc. rewards program, the hotel chain said Tuesday.

The longstanding U.S. partnership, in which JPMorgan issues Marriott credit cards and American Express issues Starwood Hotels & Resorts credit cards, was in question after Marriott purchased Starwood last year and began negotiations with the issuers.

One possibility in the process was merging the rewards programs down to a single issuer, which would have pushed all of the roughly $60 billion spent on the hotel chain's credit cards in 2016 to one lender.

Maintaining the status quo is a win for AmEx in particular; the Starwood program is the card issuer's second-largest co-brand program, following Delta Air Lines Inc. Some AmEx investors were nervous about the prospect of AmEx losing this relationship just as the company is showing signs of rebounding from the loss of the Costco Wholesale Corp. partnership that was taken over by Citigroup Inc. and Visa Inc. in 2016.

Starwood accounted for 5% of AmEx's world-wide loans and 2% of its billings in the second half of 2016, according to AmEx data. The Starwood program also is estimated to account for about 4% to 5% of AmEx's earnings, said Mark DeVries, a Barclays PLC analyst.

""The uncertainty had been an overhang on [AmEx] shares,"" Mr. DeVries wrote in a noteTuesday. ""But the announcement today resolves that uncertainty and effectively takes the worst case scenario off the table for"" AmEx.

Holding onto the account also helps departing AmEx Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault to leave on a relatively strong note and removes a large potential problem for Stephen Squeri, who takes over as AmEx chief in February.

Travel co-brand programs have lost some of their cachet with consumers in recent years as banks have rolled out more generous rewards on general-purpose credit cards.

Consumers can use those cards to redeem points for a variety of rewards and travel expenses as opposed to limiting them to certain hotel chains or airlines.

The programs have also become costlier for lenders to win. Hotels and airlines have gained more leverage over card issuers in negotiations in recent years following consolidations in those sectors. In a presentation earlier this year, Stephanie Linnartz, Marriott's global chief commercial officer, said that there would be ""upside at contract renewals"" for the hotel chain.

Marriott said in its announcement Tuesday that it expects to introduce new co-brand cards starting in 2018 with improved benefits aimed at a mix of spenders, including affluent and small-business customers.

Ctit Group,Record Earnings Mark Global Recovery --- Profit growth adds fuel to a stock rally and bolsters investor confidence for 2018," Dec 6, 2017",0,"Listed companies are at their most profitable on record after a bumper year of earnings growth across global stock markets.

The earnings per share of a FactSet index of more than 20,000 listed companies from around the world has reached an average of $9.69, increasing nearly 19% in the past year.

That is the fastest year-over-year rise since 2011, surpassing the late-2014 high of $9.55. While the FactSet data stretch back only to 2001, increased earnings in emerging markets like China, among other factors, mean that the per share level has likely never been higher.

Such high earnings per share should boost investor confidence that the recent surge in stock markets is backed by a broad global economic recovery and the ability of companies to generate returns, not just ever-higher valuations.

""This feels like the first proper postcrisis year,"" said Sunil Krishnan, head of multiasset funds at Aviva Investors. ""It doesn't end the problems with wages or productivity, but it does raise hopes that the coming couple of years are going to be more economically normal.""

Earnings growth this year picked up sharply around the world after falling short of optimistic forecasts for several years.

The Citigroup Global Economic Surprise Index, which measures whether economic data are beating or missing analyst expectations, has seen its best run since 2010 this year in both emerging and developing markets.

International trade growth is also expected to outstrip gains in global gross domestic product this year, with the International Monetary Fund expecting a 4% increase, up from 2.4% in 2016.

This has all helped boost shares. Since the lows of a market selloff in February 2016, the market capitalization of FactSet's index of 20,000 global companieshas risen by $24.7 trillion. That is more than the entire index was valued at on some days in 2009, during the aftermath of the financial crisis.

Financial stocks, which are the FactSet index's largest sector, have recorded earnings-per-share growth of 8% this year. The second-largest sector, electronic technology, has recorded a 30% increase year to date.

Some large Asian technology companies have seen particularly big rises. Earnings per share for China's Tencent Holdings Ltd. have risen by about 55% in 2017, while South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. rose 95%, according to FactSet data.

The energy and minerals section of the index has seen stellar growth, as higher commodity prices help push a 262% rebound in earnings per share, after five straight years of declines.

Still, there are risks to the rally. The global economy could take a hit from anyslowdown in Chinese growth or renewed political crises in developed markets.

Also, the index's price/earnings ratio -- a measure of how expensive stocks are relative to their potential to make money -- isn't far from records, a source of investor concern.

But most of the increase in global stock prices this year can be accounted for by a rise in earnings per share, according to analysts at Credit Suisse Group AG.

Using MSCI Inc. indexes, the bank calculated that roughly 50% of this year's U.S. stock gains is attributable to rising earnings, with the rest accounted for by rising multiples, an increase in P/E ratios.

Analysts can calculate this by looking at the movement of the share price against that of its P/E ratio. If the P/E ratio is rising at a slower speed than the share price, for instance, then the rest ofastock's gain is down to earnings growth.

In the eurozone and Japan, practically all of the increase in stock prices is accounted for by climbing earnings, as is 70% of the increase in emerging-market share prices.

""At a time of real improvement in the global economy, we're particularly interested in those regions where we think valuations aren't extended,"" said Aviva's Mr.Krishnan.

With 2017 coming to a close, big investment banks are in the process of updating their forecasts for the year ahead. Many expect the nascent pickup in earnings to continue. ""The question is whether earnings will remain a support for equities into 2018,"" J.P. Morgan said in a recent research note. ""We think that they will."""
Ctit Group,Banks Create Cyber Doomsday System," Dec 4, 2017",1,"U.S. banks have quietly launched a doomsday project they hope will prevent a run on the financial system should one of them suffer a debilitating cyberattack.

The effort, which went live earlier this year and is dubbed Sheltered Harbor, includes banks and credit unions that have roughly 400 million U.S. accounts. The effort requires member firms to individually back up data so it can be used by other firms to serve customers of a disabled bank.

While most people worry about their money being stolen in a hack, banks fear something more sinister: an attacker destroying, or even simply locking, data.

Such moves could cripple a bank, leaving it unable to operate for hours, days or perhaps much longer. If people suddenly can't access their accounts and money at one bank, customers at other banks could panic, thinking they might be vulnerable, too. This could prompt them to withdraw funds as a precaution and, in a worst-case scenario, spark a run on the wider banking system.

""So far, most people think about cyber in terms of having a credit card stolen,"" said Stuart Madnick, a professor of information technologies at the MIT Sloan School of Management. ""What you're talking about now is a nuclear attack: if you can't get to the ATM and get it to work.""

While data was stolen rather than destroyed in the Equifax Inc. hack disclosed in September, that breach was a reminder of how vulnerable consumers are. The Equifax hack exposed vital personal information of potentially 145.5 million Americans.

Especially troubling for banks is the possibility that the government could have difficulty tamping down a hack-induced panic.

Agencies like the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. have long had mechanisms meant to restore confidence in the banking and financial system. These include the Fed's discount window, which allows banks to borrow money in times of trouble, and the FDIC's deposit insurance guarantees, which ensure many bank customers won't be left in the lurch by a failure.

These mechanisms, however, were designed to counter bank failures typically induced by questions about a firm's solvency or liquidity. They don't address the fear that a bank's ATMs might one day stop working because of a cyberattack.

U.S. officials have long acknowledged they remain fearful of -- and find it hard to prepare for -- the potential confidence effect of an attack on financial data. Jerome Powell, President Donald Trump's pick as the next head of the Federal Reserve, said recently of cyber risk: ""There can never be any sense of comfort that we've got this nailed.""

Banks and regulators have been trying to devise responses. One method is to conduct ""war games,"" such as Quantum Dawn in the U.S., or Operation Waking Shark in the U.K.

In a 2015 exercise run by the U.S. Treasury known as the Hamilton Series, bankers learned that data disruptions at even small banks could shatter confidence in the broader system. The informal ""buddy bank"" system, in which two local branches agree to help each other's customers in a crisis, wasn't sufficient to stem systemic fears.

For big banks, in particular, such experiences reinforced the reality that while some institutions can spend huge amounts on cybersecurity, they can still be vulnerable if there is an overall loss of confidence. And the proliferation of technology companies using small banks to facilitate billions of dollars in mobile payments or digital loans means any institution can become a key cog in the system.

""This level of vulnerability to cyberattack didn't exist in 2008,"" said Paul Bracken, a professor at the Yale School of Management who has developed war-game scenarios with banks since the 1990s. ""The question is how you handle . . . new ports to enter the system.""

One answer was Sheltered Harbor, whose participants range from small, local institutions to giants such as Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Its 34-member board is composed of representatives of individual big banks, groups of smaller firms, trade associations, clearinghouses and broker-dealers.

The project was hatched by Phil Venables, chief operational risk officer at Goldman Sachs, and James Rosenthal, Morgan Stanley's former chief operating officer. Both are now co-chairs of Sheltered Harbor.

The idea is to ensure that every U.S. bank has the kind of backups that some of the biggest banks have used since the 1990s: protected in vaults, whether digital or physical, and unalterable once recorded.

To participate, banks pay fees ranging from$250 to $25,000a year, depending on their size. Members must follow guidelines on formatting data, creating a backup vault and submitting to audits. The goal is to make it feasible for backed-up data to start being used within 48 hours.

Of course, no defense is foolproof. Mr. Madnick, whose Cybersecurity at MIT Sloan center has studied industry groups that share security information, said such efforts have had mixed success in the past, sometimes because smaller firms find the costs of handling data to be shared prohibitive. There is also a risk that backups are compromised.

""You have to ensure the backup copy is not a copy of already scrambled data,"" he said."
Ctit Group,"Wells Fargo Bankers, Chasing Bonuses, Overcharged Clients --- Employees say foreign-currency staff ignored agreed-upon client fees"," Nov 28, 2017",1,"The whispers among employees had been around for years. They finally heard some facts during a conference call in June led by managers in Wells Fargo & Co.'s foreign-exchange operation: Some of its business customers had been cheated, according to two employees who were on the call.

An internal review showed that out of roughly300 fee agreements based on anything from informal handshakes to emails to signed documents, only about 35 companies were charged the actual price they had been offered for currency trades handled by Wells Fargo, the employees say.

The phone call was part of a continuing cleanup that has led Wells Fargo to fire four foreign-exchange bankers and federal prosecutors to open their own investigation of the operation, people familiar with the matter have said.

""Wells Fargo remains committed to our foreign exchange business,"" the bank said in a statement Monday. ""If we find a problem, we fix it."" The bank said its foreign-exchange business is ""under new management.""

The business is tiny compared with foreign-exchange operations at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. but could become another huge headache for the San Francisco bank, still grappling with fallout from the sales-practices scandal in its retail operations. The scandal led to last year's abrupt retirement of Wells Fargo's chief executive, a $185 million regulatory settlement and numerous federal and state investigations, which are continuing.

Wells Fargo retail employees had to hit lofty goals to keep their jobs or get bonuses, which led some employees to open potentially 3.5 million accounts with fictitious or unauthorized customer information from 2009 to 2015.

Foreign-exchange employees got bonuses based solely on how much revenue they brought in, say more than a dozen current or former Wells Fargo employees. No other big bank in the U.S. calculated bonuses of currency traders in such a defined and individual way. Wells Fargo said Monday that it began making changes to those compensation plans earlier this year.

The bank also charged some of the highest trading fees around, according to current and former employees. For more than a decade, customers were sometimes charged anywhere from 1% to 4% on basic transactions such as converting euros to dollars and complicated trades like hedging.

Those percentages can be at least two to eight times higher than the middle-market industry average of 0.15% to 0.5%, depending on the trade, customer and volume, according to foreign-exchange bankers throughout the industry.

Wells Fargo disputes the descriptions of its foreign-exchange fees by current and former employees. The bank said Monday its fees in 2016 had a weighted average of 0.09 percentage point across all transaction sizes. Clients served by its middle-market banking team were charged a weighted average of 0.18 percentage point, according to Wells Fargo.

Some foreign-exchange bankers at Wells Fargo relied on the fact that customers often didn't bother to double-check how much they were charged, fee levels weren't straightforward, and complaints could be batted away, the current and former employees say.

One former Wells Fargo manager says employees would tell customers who expressed surprise at the size of a trading fee that market prices were different at the moment when the transaction was executed and blame ""time fluctuation"" for any difference.

The bank's foreign-exchange customers have included telecommunications firm CenturyLink Inc., vehicle-parts supplier Federal-Mogul Holdings Corp. and nonprofit groups such as the National Bone Marrow Donor Program.

Regulators have been investigating the foreign-exchange business at Wells Fargo, including a big trade involving Restaurant Brands International Inc., the owner of Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, according to people familiar with the matter.

The trade resulted in a loss to Restaurant Brands, people familiar with the matter have said, which led to a dispute between the Oakville, Ontario, company and the bank. The dispute centered on how bank employees handled the trade, rather than its pricing. Wells Fargo refunded about $900,000 to Restaurant Brands, people familiar with the refund say.

The foreign-exchange business's problems run far deeper than what is known inside Wells Fargo as ""the Burger King trade"" or what has been previously reported. The extent of the trouble seems to have become apparent to top Wells Fargo executives earlier this year.

The business was moved in early 2017 from Wells Fargo's international division into its investment-banking and capital-markets operation. Since then, executives have changed internal systems, added more stringent rules around pricing and required more frequent compliance checks, current and former employees say.

Issues with the Burger King trade were found following those checks and customer complaints, people familiar with the matter say. The continuing internal review of Wells Fargo's foreign-exchange operation is separate from the review sparked by the sales scandal, some of the people said.

A compliance training session in early November detailed what Wells Fargo called ""approved margins"" for different volumes of foreign-exchange transactions, according to an internal document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Employees say fee levels remain higher than industry norms, and some compensation practices aren't due to change until next year.

Foreign-exchange trading has been a problem area for many banks. In 2015, several large U.S. and European banks agreed to multibillion-dollar settlements with U.S. regulators and pleaded guilty to criminal charges filed by U.S. authorities over alleged collusion among currency traders.

Bank of New York Mellon Corp. agreed in 2015 to pay $714 million to resolve allegations it defrauded pension funds and other clients by overcharging them on currency transactions. State Street Corp. agreed in 2016 to pay $530 million to settle similar allegations.

Both banks admitted giving some clients far worse pricing on currency transactions than the banks implied the clients would get.

The Journal reported in October that the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California is investigating the Restaurant Brands currency trade and has subpoenaed information from Wells Fargo.

Potential issues related to that trade also are being examined by the Federal Reserve, the Journal reported. Examiners from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are auditing Wells Fargo's foreign-exchange business, according to employees at the bank. A Wells Fargo executive says the audit is ""normal course of business.""

Current and former bank employees say its pricing practices were rooted in a culture and compensation system that looked to maximize revenue. Bonuses were defined as 10% of revenues exceeding revenue targets.

If a banker's revenue target was $5 million and the person brought in $6 million, he or she would earn a $100,000 bonus, or 10% of the additional $1 million in revenue. Bankers typically received such bonuses twice a year in cash, rather than stock, as part of a signed contract, they added.

It's rare among foreign-exchange groups in other banks to have so-called defined-bonus plans focused on individual earnings, according to people in the industry.

After Wells Fargo moved the foreign-exchange business into its investment bank earlier this year, managers began telling employees that bonuses would become ""discretionary"" by the end of 2017. Under this more typical arrangement, management would decide employee bonuses, and bankers wouldn't know exactly how much they would receive. It would be based on a variety of factors, not just revenue.

Wells Fargo has 18 foreign-exchange sales and trading offices, including in New York, San Francisco, Charlotte, N.C., London and Hong Kong. A few hundred people work in the group world-wide.

Current and former employees say Wells Fargo's foreign-exchange customers are largely midsize businesses that don't tend to trade in large volumes. As a result, those clients don't have the same insight into the market as larger firms that are more-active traders.

Some Wells Fargo clients have complained to the bank. In November 2016, Ecolab Inc., a water, hygiene and energy company based in St. Paul, Minn., bought and sold currency in a so-called swap arranged by the bank, according to people familiar with the deal. These people say Wells Fargo collected 1% on one part of the $100 million deal.

After Ecolab compared the full trade, including fees, to overall market prices, the company contested the bank's fee. Wells Fargo refunded hundreds of thousands of dollars to Ecolab in December 2016, according to current and former employees.

A spokeswoman for Ecolab confirmed the details of the trade and said it was the only fee issue Ecolab had with Wells Fargo.

Fee issues arose for some Wells Fargo clients even when they had a pricing agreement. The bank agreed within the past 18 months to a specified rate with data-management firm Veritas Technologies LLC, according to bank employees. After making one trade on behalf of Veritas, Wells Fargo bankers told Veritas that the bank's fee was 0.05 percentage point higher than the agreed rate, the employees say.

The result: The bank made an extra $50,000 on a $100 million trade, the employees say. Wells Fargo later made a refund to Veritas, according to people familiar with the matter. A Veritas spokeswoman declined to comment.

Wells Fargo's foreign-exchange business also charged unusually high fees for trades with different currency conversions, known as ""Bswift"" transactions, current and former employees say.

""And if anybody did complain, it was an easy tap dance,"" one former employee says. He says employees would say the pricing had been done automatically by the bank's computer system so ""there's no accountability for the spread.""

Wells Fargo sent an internal email Nov. 2 detailing new guidelines for Bswift transactions, according to a copy of the email reviewed by the Journal. The guidelines include specific handling and pricing procedures for those trades.

The operation also charged high fees to other parts of Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo Rail, which leases locomotives and railcars, and the bank's corporate-trust division are often charged 1% to 1.5% on currency transactions, according to current and former employees.

The bank's foreign-exchange management often celebrated big trades and the money they made for the bank, the current and former employees say. Sara Wardell-Smith, who led the foreign-exchange group, emailed the group to hail big trades, naming clients and spelling out revenue generated. The employees say managers used to encourage employees to ring a brass bell in the San Francisco office when the bank made a lot of money on a trade.

In mid-October, the bank announced that Ms. Wardell-Smith would lead its financial institutions group in the Americas region, according to a memo reviewed by the Journal and confirmed by a bank spokeswoman.

Current employees say the move was viewed within Wells Fargo as a demotion, coming just months after Ms. Wardell-Smith had been promoted to co-lead the bank's division focusing on trading of rates, currencies and commodities. She didn't respond to requests for comment.

The other co-leader, Ben Bonner, now leads that group on his own and is overseeing foreign-exchange trading, a bank spokeswoman confirms.

Mr. Bonner has been working with other executives to fix the problems in the currency business, according to several current employees.

Last month, the bank sent a memo to foreign-exchange employees that instructs them not to create informal or oral pricing agreements. The memo, reviewed by the Journal, also said employees are ""responsible for ensuring customers are not misled regarding"" pricing.

Current and former employees say some Wells Fargo employees expressed concerns about pricing practices to top executives before the bank's internal cleanup efforts began earlier this year. Some employees say they were reluctant to press for sweeping changes, citing what they saw happen to one manager in the foreign-exchange operation about a decade ago.

During a meeting of foreign-exchange managers in the mid-2000s, Cathy Witt said it wasn't right to celebrate high fees by ringing a bell, people familiar with the situation say. Ms. Witt, an employee in the bank's Chicago foreign-exchange group, warned that Wells Fargo could become known as a ""bucket shop,"" a derisive term for a disreputable finance firm, some of the people say.

A few weeks later, Ms. Witt was summoned to a meeting in St. Louis, told that her comments had been offensive and demoted on the spot, according to people familiar with the matter. She also was told to apologize to other managers for her unprofessional behavior, the people say. She later left the bank."
Ctit Group,"Coins Are Right Half the Time, Beating Economists"," Nov 27, 2017",1,"In your editorial ""A Nafta Recession?"" (Nov. 13), you cite a survey of economists in which ""82% said the economy would grow more slowly for the next two years than it would otherwise, and 7% predicted a recession."" The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and Citigroup have published data on the inaccuracy of economists' predictions. Tim Hartford in the Financial Times reports Prakash Lougani, an economist with the IMF, wrote in 2001: ""The record of failure to predict recessions is virtually unblemished"" (throughout 1990s). Mr. Hartford reports that Mr. Lougani and a colleague, Hites Ahir, in 2014 continued to report the dismal predictive results of economists internationally. Since only 7% of economists predict recession this may be the more likely event. Once 82% predict a recession, it has either already happened or it won't."
Ctit Group,Loan Growth Hits a Rut," Nov 27, 2017",1,"Loan growth at banks is slowing, casting a cloud over what was supposed to have been a banner year for financial institutions following last November's elections.

The rate of 12-month loan growth at U.S. banks in the third quarter hit its lowest level since the end of 2013, according to data released last week by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. That marked the sixth consecutive quarter of decline for this measure of loan growth.

Growth in each of the four major lending categories measured by the FDIC fell. Notably, the growth rate for business lending, an important source of revenues for banks in recent years, plumbed its lowest level since the first quarter of 2011.

While loan balances are still rising, the slowing rate of growth has defied the expectations of bankers. Many have spent the year looking for growth-reviving catalysts that never came and remain puzzled by the slowdown.

Even more surprising is that falling rates of loan growth are occurring as many signals point to a more buoyant U.S. economy. Unemployment continues to decline, gross domestic product growth came in at 3% in the third quarter and business investment is rising.

Tepid rates of loan growth along with continued low long-term interest rates have taken some of the sizzle out of bank stocks. Financial shares were among the chief beneficiaries of last November's election surprise, soaring on hopes of a tax-code overhaul, lighter regulation and stronger economic growth. With progress in these areas uneven during 2017, gains are more muted.

The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, a measure of 24 of the largest commercial banks, is up about 8% since the start of the year, about half the rise of the S&P 500.

""There was such enthusiasm coming out of the election,"" said Gerard Cuddy, CEO of Beneficial Bancorp Inc., a community lender in Philadelphia. ""I think reality is setting in.""

The slowdown in lending growth raises questions about firms' prospects for 2018, especially given that long-term interest rates haven't moved much, even as short-term ones are climbing. The difference, or spread, between 10-year and two-year U.S. Treasury debt, a rough proxy for bank profitability, is around 0.6 percentage point, its lowest level in a decade.

If loans balances aren't growing briskly and the interest-rate spread is narrow, it is far tougher for banks to increase net-interest income.

""The plane used to be flying at 30,000 feet, now it's at 10,000,"" said Christopher Marinac, director of research at investment-banking boutique FIG Partners. ""There are many banks that are concerned about how much they can grow the loan book in 2018.""

At the biggest U.S. banks, loan growth in the third quarter was spotty. At J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp., total loans grew 3% from a year earlier. Citigroup Inc. posted growth of 2%, while total loans at Wells Fargo & Co. fell 1%.

Loan growth was anemic among many smaller banks. At BB&T Corp., total loans in the third quarter were roughly flat compared with a year earlier. In an earnings call last month, CEO Kelly King said more clients were taking advantage of low rates in the bond markets and paying off their bank loans. Hurricanes in the southern U.S. also had an effect.

He added the bank is purposely restructuring its loan portfolio to focus on more-profitable loans. Still, Mr. King nodded at deeper issues around the downshift, saying ""the mega issue here is that, you know, we've been on a nine-year slow economy.""

An area of particular concern for all banks is business lending. In the third quarter, the 12-month growth rate for business loans fell to 2.48% from 2.79% the prior quarter and 7.67% a year earlier.

The drop-off is even more pronounced based on weekly Federal Reserve data. Commercial and industrial loans, or business lending, in early November were up less than 1% from a year prior, the data show.

From mid-2014 through mid-2016, growth of such loans was regularly in the double digits. This is putting 2017 on track to be the worst year for business-loan growth since 2010, when the economy was still wrestling with the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis.

It remains unclear why. Throughout the year, some banks have said more subdued business lending was due to a lack of clarity from Washington on the fate of initiatives on taxes and health care.

Such worries should eventually fade, though, said Darren King, finance chief at M&T Bank Corp., where loans in the third quarter were down 2% versus a year earlier. ""Business owners are eventually going to get to the point where they say, 'I can't wait to find out what is going to happen in Washington,'"" he said.

Even so, ""that doesn't mean I think we're going back to 2015 or 2016 levels"" of loan growth, Mr. King added.

Some bankers also have cited heightened competition. More business customers are tapping the bond market instead of bank loans to take advantage of low interest rates there, while insurance companies are offering to fund 30-year commercial mortgages and hedge funds are lending to riskier companies.

Others think the slowdown in business lending is a hangover from above-average growth in recent years. Many potential corporate clients are already loaded up on debt, said Kevin Barker, an analyst at Piper Jaffray & Co. That tamps down demand for loans. It also makes some banks wary of lending even more to these companies, he added."
Ctit Group,"World News: At the Riyadh Ritz, Detained Saudis Negotiate for Freedom"," Nov 22, 2017",0,"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has become a regular visitor to the Ritz-Carlton on the western side of his nation's capital, which is now a luxurious detention center for wealthy Saudis caught up in a widening corruption probe, according to Saudi officials.

Prince Mohammed, who heads the committee leading the investigation, typically travels with only a few trusted advisers, and his visits to the five-star hotel near Riyadh's Diplomatic Quarter and several royal palaces tend to last for a while, Saudi officials said.

""He does spend hours,"" one Saudi official said. ""It is never a quick visit.""

For the past two weeks, detainees at the Ritz have negotiated with Prince Mohammed and his deputies about handing large chunks of their wealth to the state in exchange for their freedom, according to Saudi officials. The amounts detainees are being asked to surrender are commensurate with what they are alleged to have gained improperly, Saudi officials said.

The Saudi government didn't respond to requests to comment.

Designed originally as a palace for hosting foreign dignitaries, the Ritz boasts almost 500 rooms, a sprawling indoor pool, a small bowling alley and a lobby with four statues of rearing stallions.

Room prices range from around $500 a night to more than $6,000 for the ""royal suite."" But regular guests aren't allowed beyond the hotel's high walls at the moment.

Authorities have expanded the medical facilities available on site, after some detainees sought medical care outside the hotel, according to Saudi officials. The decision was made ""to avoid any detainees being transferred to local hospitals and having interaction with people outside the investigation,"" one Saudi official said.

The government set up additional medical facilities within the nearby four-star Courtyard by Marriott, according to Saudi officials.

""The Ritz-Carlton, Riyadh and the Courtyard, Diplomatic Quarter are not operating as traditional hotels for the time being,"" said a spokesman for Marriott International Inc., which operates both hotels.

Rooms aren't available through the Ritz's online booking portal until February.

Those detained at the Ritz include businessmen and members of the royal family, according to Saudi officials. Billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal -- a top investor in Citigroup Inc., Twitter Inc. and Lyft Inc. -- is there, as is Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, the former head of the Saudi National Guard, according to Saudi officials. They couldn't be reached to comment.

The Saudi government has established a special committee to handle forfeitures and to organize the transfer of assets to the Saudi state, according to Saudi officials.

""The investigation committee is aiming for about 70% of the total ill-gotten money, rather than the entire money,"" said a senior Saudi adviser, adding that seizing half of the funds would be a more realistic outcome. A number of the detainees have agreed to deals, according to Saudi officials. Many are still holding out for better terms, they said."
Ctit Group,Business News: Alibaba Sees Growth in The Stores --- Online shopping giant to pay $2.88 billion for a 36% stake in a Wal- Mart China competitor," Nov 21, 2017",0,"HONG KONG -- E-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is making another big bet on brick-and-mortar, saying it will pay $2.88 billion for a 36% stake in China's second-largest big-box retailer, Sun Art Retail Group Ltd.

Alibaba, which runs the world's largest online shopping operation, sees traditional retail venues as a way to expand its reach into fresh foods while also creating new demand for its Alipay mobile-payment business and its logistics services.

""Physical stores serve an indispensable role during the consumer journey, and should be enhanced through data-driven technology and personalized services in the digital economy,"" Alibaba chief executive officer Daniel Zhang said in a statement.

Alibaba's wager follows online retailer Amazon.com Inc.'s roughly $13.5 billion purchase of U.S. grocer Whole Foods. While Amazon is competing head-on with supermarkets, Alibaba says it is focused instead on joining with retailers.

The rush by Alibaba into physical retail in recent years has already involved investments of at least $5 billion, as it took stakes in companies including shopping-mall operator Intime Retail Group (Co.), Sanjiang Shopping Club Co. and electronics retailer Suning Commerce Group Ltd. Alibaba also runs the small Hema supermarket chain in China, which offers internet purchases and deliveries within the hour for customers nearby.

Hong Kong-listed Sun Art is a French-Taiwanese joint venture that runs more than 450 large supermarket-department stores in China under the RT Mart and Auchan brands. Alibaba is buying both a direct stake and indirect stake. As part of the transaction, Auchan Retail, Sun Art's main shareholder, its raising its stake to 36.2%.

Sun Art gained popularity for customizing its store products and formats to local needs, such as stocking hot sauce on shelves alongside live clams in tanks where shoppers could pick and choose.

Sun Art's 14.6% share of China's hypermarket sector last year made it second only to China Resources Holding Co., at 15.5%, according to industry researcher Euromonitor International. Wal-Mart's China operation is third with 10.2%.

Annual sales growth at Sun Art has been slowing in the past three years, as more Chinese move their grocery shopping online. Revenue grew 4.1% in 2016, compared with 5.0% a year earlier.

One banker involved in the transaction expects more such tie-ups of physical and online retailers, based on conversations his team is having with other Asia Pacific clients.

China International Capital Corp. advised Alibaba on the deal, while Citigroup Inc. advised the Taiwan-based seller."
Ctit Group,Business News: Jacob Lew Prepares Return to Finance," Nov 20, 2017",1,"WASHINGTON -- Former Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew is joining a midmarket New York private-equity firm, adding his name to the long list of high-ranking government officials entering the sector in recent years.

Mr. Lew, who ran the Treasury during President Barack Obama's second term, will become a partner at Lindsay Goldberg LLC, firm executives told The Wall Street Journal. The company has about $15 billion in capital and specializes in investing in family and founder-run businesses.

The move marks a return to finance for Mr. Lew, who worked for about two years at Citigroup Inc., in between cabinet-level stints in the Clinton and Obama administrations. Mr. Lew's predecessor as Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, became president of private-equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC shortly after he left the government in 2013.

Like Mr. Geithner, Mr. Lew, 62 years old, plans to play an active role in helping run the firm, a contrast with many public figures who join private-equity companies in an advisory role.

Mr. Lew said that after years in leadership roles in large bureaucracies -- in addition to his stint at the Treasury, he also served as Mr. Obama's White House chief of staff, and director of the White House Office of Management and Budget -- he was drawn to a smaller organization. ""The federal government was quite a labyrinth of activity,"" he said in an interview. ""At this stage of life, I'm looking forward to working on things more circumscribed."""
Ctit Group,World News: Riyadh Seeks Cash Settlements in Corruption Probe," Nov 18, 2017",1,"Authorities in Saudi Arabia are widening a corruption investigation that has reached the upper echelons of the royal family and entangled prominent businessmen who are now being asked to surrender assets in exchange for their freedom, according to two people familiar with the matter.

At least two dozen military officers, including multiple commanders, recently have been rounded up in connection with the Saudi government's sweeping corruption investigation, according to two senior advisers to the Saudi government. Several prominent businessmen also were taken in by Saudi authorities in recent days.

It isn't clear if those people are all accused of wrongdoing, or whether some of them have been called in as witnesses. But their detainment signals an intensifying high-stakes campaign spearheaded by Saudi Arabia's 32-year-old crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.

Saudi authorities launched a campaign of arrests on Nov. 4 that has swept up some of the kingdom's wealthiest and most powerful people, including royals and cabinet ministers. Among them are billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, a top investor in companies including Twitter, Citigroup and Lyft, as well as Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, the former head of the National Guard, one of the kingdom's three main security forces. Neither could be reached to comment.

The government said 201 people have been held without charges, but hasn't officially named those people. Nearly 2,000 bank accounts have been frozen, according to three people briefed on the matter.

Saudi authorities said all wealth that can be proved was amassed through corruption would become state property. Authorities are pushing for plea bargains that could see the accused transfer the bulk of their wealth to the state.

The government initially hoped to recover as much as $800 billion it believed was accumulated illegally, much of it kept abroad. Now, authorities believe they can lay claim on assets worth about $300 billion to $400 billion, according to two people.

""They don't want to put these people in jail,"" said one person familiar with the matter. ""They want the money.""

Most of those detained are being held in Riyadh's Ritz Carlton hotel, which is operating as a high-security five-star prison."
Ctit Group,"Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Citigroup's Credit Card Plans Hit Snag --- Bank's stock is up 22% this year, but cracks in a crucial unit stand to complicate the picture"," Nov 14, 2017",1,"One of the bright spots in Citigroup Inc.'s turnaround strategy is starting to lose a little luster.

For years, the New York-based bank has steadily expanded its card business, boosting loans and investing heavily despite problems elsewhere that ranged from headaches in Mexico to regulatory problems that lingered after the financial crisis.

But now, some cracks in the card business have emerged, raising questions just as Chief Executive Michael Corbat has shored up the bank's other issues.

This summer, the bank lowered its return-on-asset projection for Citi-branded credit cards to at least 2.15% from 2.25%. The seemingly narrow slice of one part of Citigroup's sprawling empire is getting a lot of attention, in part because credit cards have been a crucial business for a bank that has spent much of its efforts getting smaller and simpler.

Citigroup is the largest card lender globally by some measures and is the second-biggest in the U.S. by balances, according to industry tracker the Nilson Report, even as it has cut hundreds of U.S. branches since the financial crisis.

Among the factors pressuring the business are more activity on cards that don't tend to generate as much lending income and consumers' increasing demand for rewards.""It's clear that the company has gotten off to a slower-than-expected start"" on meeting card-growth goals, Compass Point analyst Charles Peabody wrote in a note.

The worries contrast with an overall rise in investor expectations. Citigroup's stock has risen 22% in 2017, the highest gain among the big U.S. banks. Mr. Corbat has declared restructuring at the once-troubled bank over, and in July, it unveiled a plan to return more than $60 billion in capital to shareholders by 2020 through dividends and share buybacks.

To sustain that momentum, the bank has made consumer cards a priority. Today, cards make up 24% of Citigroup's total lending -- a far bigger share than its rival big banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp., which remain focused on mass-market retail banking.

While revenue and profits in the U.S. branded-card business haven't taken off in recent years, the bank's aim was for its investments to start paying off in the second half of this year. However, in the third quarter, North American revenue from Citi-branded cards fell 1% from a year ago. The bank did increase the unit's revenue from the second quarter to the third quarter. Its results compare with a July forecast for 3% annual revenue growth through 2020 in the unit.

In October, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach told analysts that ""we are seeing slower-than-anticipated revenue growth,"" due largely to increases in ""the competitive dynamics in the rewards offerings in the U.S."" The bank also has noted heavy volume in card partnerships with big merchants, which has resulted in cards that people tend to use for spending rather than borrowing.

Still, Citigroup didn't change its longer-term growth or return forecasts for the branded-card business. Citigroup has sought to boost growth in part by promoting no-interest card borrowing, a tactic that it has long used. Over the past three years through September, the bank has mailed about 1.9 billion offers in the U.S. for credit cards with zero-percent interest for a promotional period, according to market research firm Mintel Group Ltd.

The maneuvers have helped the bank maintain and expand its vast card business. Citigroup in 2015 outbid American Express Co. to win the rights to issue credit cards for shoppers at retail giant Costco Wholesale Corp., adding millions of new accounts and more than $10 billion in loans.

But giving up interest for a period has been costly, especially during a period of rising interest rates that ordinarily would boost the bank's lending revenue. The bank's aim has long been to dial back these offers, increase interest income and lean on other enticements such as its mobile application features or rewards points.

Under global cards head Jud Linville, who joined Citigroup in 2010 from American Express, the bank has invested to boost cards' appeal. It introduced new proprietary cards such as the Double Cash card, made it easier to spend rewards points online and is adding new mobile functions this year. The goal is ""building huge engagement with our customers,"" Mr. Linville said in an interview earlier this year."
Ctit Group,Firm Goes Artsy to Lure Techies," Nov 8, 2017",1,"Walk into the first floor of 131 Sloane St., in London's exclusive Knightsbridge district, and you might assume you are in a lavish private apartment. With its reclaimed wood ceilings, antique industrial lighting and family photomontages, it looks like the home of a hip and successful creative type.

But the property is the new headquarters of Marshall Wace Asset Management, a large hedge-fund operator with $34 billion in assets under management as of Sept. 30.

The look couldn't be more different from the firm's previous home, a sterile collection of polished wood, glass walls and rows of computer screens on the Strand, a main artery in Central London.

According to co-founder Ian Wace, the office change was partly a response to the challenges facing the hedge-fund industry and partly a salvo in the escalating war for top talent.

Hedge-fund managers, particularly technology-intensive ones such as Marshall Wace, are in a fierce battle with the likes of Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc. to hire and retain the world's best data scientists. The work environment is an important part of the package, some believe.

Mr. Wace said the firm's attrition rate is in line with the industry average of around 10% a year. He hopes to cut it in half. ""That would easily pay for the extra costs of the new office,"" he said.

Silicon Valley companies are famous for their brightly colored offices featuring pool tables and beverages on demand. Some financial firms have adopted the same sort of vibe, at least in parts of their business. In the heart of Toronto's financial district, Aviva PLC, the British insurer, recently opened a new office to house some of its digital development team, with bare concrete floors and exposed ceiling ducts, and meeting spaces made from recycled shipping containers painted bright blue.

Duncan Ford, Marshall Wace's chief operating officer, said the firm considered a similar look, but opted for something more ""grown-up.""

""That is not to say Google is not grown-up,"" he said. ""We obviously compete for talent with the Googles and Facebooks, but we are also a different type of firm. We have fiduciary responsibilities and need to show clients that their money is in safe hands.""

While planning the new office, the Marshall Wace team looked at what had been done by some other companies, including McCann, the advertising agency owned by Interpublic Group of Cos. McCann's recently refurbished headquarters on New York's Third Avenue features an open, cafe-style space used for meetings and more general working.

""Our design goes one step further, I suppose, in blending that together with a residential style as well as delivering office functionality,"" Mr. Ford said.

There was an unofficial GBP 500 (about $660) limit on any single design item, though there are a few artworks from Mr. Wace's own collection. These include a pair of 200-year-old life-size wooden elephants that stood outside a Hindu temple in Rajasthan. Mr. Wace bought them and shipped them to the lobby of the new offices for what he proudly says was a total of just GBP 15,000.

Other financial firms have also been rethinking their workspaces in an attempt to break down silos and encourage face-to-face meetings. In the recent revamp of its headquarters in Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood, Citigroup Inc. shifted to an open-plan layout where not even the CEO has an office door.

One challenge facing hedge-fund firms in particular is convincing staff and investors they will last beyond the involvement of their founders.

Demonstrating a commitment to longevity was one reason Marshall Wace sold a 24.9% stake to KKR & Co., a private-equity firm, in 2015. KKR is itself planning a big office move in 2020, having taken the top 10 floors of the Hudson Yards development in Manhattan.

Although the design phase is some way off, senior KKR executives have recently visited the new Marshall Wace office looking for inspiration.

""With cutting-edge design and technology, Marshall Wace created a physical environment where every detail is meant to feed aspiration, a drive to excel and encourage collaboration,"" said Scott Nuttall, KKR's co-president and co-chief operating officer."
Ctit Group,Saudi Arrests Upset Financial Outlook --- Moves come at a delicate time as crown prince tries to diversify kingdom's economy," Nov 7, 2017",1,"A far-reaching crackdown that extends into Saudi Arabia's business elite has abruptly raised the stakes for global investors just as the kingdom embarks on a campaign to lure foreign capital to help overhaul its oil-dependent economy.

Dozens of princes, senior Saudi officials and prominent businessmen were arrested over the weekend as part of what the government cast as an effort to root out corruption. Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, a billionaire whose firm holds significant stakes in Apple Inc., Citigroup Inc. and Twitter Inc., was among those detained. An attempt to reach him through the firm, Kingdom Holding Co., was unsuccessful.

The crackdown comes at a delicate moment for Saudi Arabia. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the 32-year-old son of King Salman, is leading efforts to diversify the economy. Central to that strategy are plans for an initial public offering of shares in the state-owned oil giant, known as Aramco. The kingdom is also maneuvering for regional influence with rival Iran, and mired in a war in neighboring Yemen.

Now, investors confront distinct potential outcomes from the crackdown: a Saudi business environment that is less opaque and easier for outsiders to navigate, or an increased risk of political upheaval or legal uncertainty.

""What's confusing for Western investors is that [the purge] is achieving modernization and Westernization through some very aggressive means,"" said Christopher Johnson, chairman of the American Business Group of Riyadh, which promotes and represents U.S. business interests in the kingdom.

President Donald Trump tweeted from Asia on Tuesday that he has great confidence in King Salman and the crown prince, saying ""they know exactly what they are doing."" He added in another tweet that ""Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!""

King Salman shook up the kingdom's succession plan in June by removing the then-crown prince and elevating his son. Since then, the kingdom has taken steps to show it is opening up to the world.

In September, the king issued a decree giving Saudi women the right to drive, a move that was condemned by Saudi conservatives and welcomed by the U.S. Two weeks ago, Prince Mohammed presided over an investment conference dubbed ""Davos in the Desert"" that attracted luminaries from the global financial community such as Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, and billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson. At the event, the crown prince called for Saudi Arabia to return to a more tolerant form of Islam.

Mr. Johnson and some foreign investors predicted the Saudi government's crackdown would result in a more open and welcoming business environment in Saudi Arabia.

""There are always powerful vested interests, which resist change and which need to be dislodged in order to effect change,"" said Jan Dehn, head of research at fund manager Ashmore Group in London, which opened a local asset management office in Riyadh in 2014. ""Mohammed Bin Salman is going to change Saudi Arabia more than people imagine -- and for the better.""

Yet the crackdown is touching prominent members of Saudi society. Among the detainees is Ibrahim Al-Assaf, the country's former finance minister and a member of the Aramco board of directors, according to Saudi officials. An attempt to reach Mr. Al-Assaf through Aramco was unsuccessful.

And it could create new potential sources of uncertainty for investors.

""The speed and breadth of the clampdown could deal a blow to the economy,"" Jason Tuvey, a Middle East analyst at Capital Economics, a London-based economic-research firm, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. ""Firms might delay investment plans as they await to see if they will get caught up in the allegations.""

There are signs that investors are wary. Oil prices surged to two-year highs on Monday, with U.S. crude prices up 3.1% to $57.35 a barrel. Saudi Arabia is the world's top crude exporter.

The cost to insure against the risk of default in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the Middle East rose on Monday, as measured by the market for credit default swaps.

""It's a lot of change really fast in a region that isn't really prone to a lot of quick change. And that causes a lot of uncertainty,"" said Jason Trujillo, a portfolio manager at Invesco Ltd. in Atlanta.

Invesco has been broadly negative on the Middle East since several countries including Saudi Arabia cut off diplomatic relations with the tiny Gulf emirate of Qatar in June, Mr. Trujillo said.

Many executives whose companies are active in Saudi Arabia were reluctant to discuss the arrests for what they said was fear of losing business in the kingdom in the near future.

Kingdom Holding, whose shares have fallen sharply over Sunday and Monday, said on Sunday it was ""business as usual"" and that it still has the government's support."
Ctit Group,Bank Investors Made a Mint on Crisis," Nov 7, 2017",1,"The U.S. banking industry is booming -- a development that is bringing windfall gains to a small group of investors who had the gumption to buy esoteric bank securities when the outlook for financial firms and the economy was far less clear cut.

After years of banks grappling with the fallout of the crisis and low interest rates, the bets on what are known as TARP warrants are finally paying off. The investors, who include fund managers John Paulson and Bill Miller, bought these warrants for bank stocks secondhand, after they were initially issued to the government during the 2008 bank bailout.

The investors' unpopular view at the time was that banks and their stock prices would recover to precrisis levels. By betting on warrants, a high-octane security similar to an option, the fund managers basically doubled down on that opinion, risking their entire investment if it didn't happen by 2018 or 2019.

""If the subprime credit-default swaps were this asymmetric, beautiful investment to express what was wrong with American capitalism . . . , these securities are the opposite,"" said Django Davidson, a founding partner at London-based Hosking Partners LLP, which bought about $200 million of the warrants for banks including Bank of America Corp.

The warrants date to the financial crisis, when the government invested about $250 billion in about 700 banks as a part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. As part of TARP, which aimed to shore up bank capital and restart lending, the government got warrants to buy shares in the banks. The Treasury Department started getting rid of the warrants in 2009, a process that included selling some off to investors.

For years after the crisis, many investors hated bank stocks, comparing them to heavily regulated utilities no longer able to take risks and grow. The warrants also slumped; some of Citigroup Inc.'s fell so much they were delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2016.

But since the November 2016 presidential election, bank stocks have helped lead a broad stock-market rally tied to renewed confidence and hopes of tax and regulatory overhaul. Meanwhile, banks' crisis-era legal problems have subsided and interest rates have started to rise, making lending more profitable.

The change in sentiment has made the warrants a turnaround story. Some from big banks have surged 65% to 1,440% since the election, easily outpacing the 36% rally in the KBW Nasdaq Bank stock index. One group of Bank of America's warrants, once left for dead, are up the most in the group. With the recent jump, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. warrants are up 426% since they started trading in late 2009, compared with a 146% increase for the bank's stock.

The warrants give investors the right to buy a stock at a predetermined price. If the stock rises far above that ""strike price,"" the warrant is like a winning lottery ticket. If it stays below that price, the warrant ends up worthless.

While exchange-traded stock options usually go out only a couple of years, warrants often last longer. ""We were lucky it was a 10-year warrant,"" said Philippe Jabre, a Geneva-based fund manager who bought warrants in SunTrust Banks Inc., among others. He said the recovery took longer than he had expected.

""There were good days and other days when I felt like crying,"" said John Hadwen, a portfolio manager at CI Investments' Signature Global Asset Management, which has held TARP warrants since 2010. When his J.P. Morgan warrants fell in value after the bank's 2012 London whale trading loss, Mr. Hadwen pushed to buy the rest available, but the Canadian asset manager's chief investment officer said no.

Mr. Davidson said he learned about the warrants a few years ago at an Omaha, Neb., bar where he was mingling with attendees at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting. Warren Buffett, the conglomerate's chairman, got warrants unrelated to TARP as a part of Berkshire's crisis-era investments in Goldman Sachs Group and Bank of America.

The Miller Opportunity Trust mutual fund said it has notched gains of about $77 million on a $24 million investment in J.P. Morgan warrants.

When the fund bought the warrants, ""the market hated financials and was pricing in pretty dire scenarios,"" said Samantha McLemore, co-manager on the portfolio with Mr. Miller.

Mr. Paulson, who made billions of dollars betting against subprime mortgages a decade ago, turned a roughly $100 million profit on about $600 million in bank warrant investments, according to a person familiar with the matter. But he could have earned more if his funds hadn't sold their J.P. Morgan warrants in 2012. Mr. Miller's fund similarly lost out by selling Bank of America warrants around that time, though Ms. McLemore said the fund has done well by hanging on to the bank's common stock.

Investors got the warrants only because the U.S. government didn't want to hold on to them. By late 2009, the biggest banks had paid TARP money back and the Treasury started auctioning the warrants. By the end of 2012, it had made about $5 billion auctioning them off to investors. In other cases, Treasury sold the warrants back to the banks.

That has transferred the rest of the gains to private hands. The TARP warrants still trading in Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo & Co. and PNC Financial Services Group Inc., for example, are worth more than $2 billion more on paper than when the government sold. At banks such as J.P. Morgan that hit their strike price a while ago, investors have likely netted additional profits by exercising the warrants.

New York-based Maltese Capital Management bought 2.2 million TARP warrants in Salt Lake City-based Zions Bancorp. from the government for about $1.35 apiece and held on to most of them. Today, they are worth about $11.15 a share, a return of around 726%. ""We'd like a few more of those,"" said Terry Maltese, the firm's founder."
Ctit Group,World News: Detained Prince Has Backed U.S. Firms --- Prince al-Waleed gained prominence after buying shares of Citigroup predecessor," Nov 6, 2017",1,"NEW YORK -- The arrest this weekend of billionaire tycoon Prince al-Waleed bin Talal hobbles an investor who has straddled east and west, backing some of the world's best-known companies while also encouraging U.S. business to invest in the Middle East.

The Saudi Arabian prince was among dozens of people who were arrested as part of a crackdown on corruption in the kingdom, as King Salman and his son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman move to consolidate power. Prince al-Waleed hasn't been charged, but could face allegations of money laundering and illegal arms sales, people familiar with the matter said.

Representatives for Prince al-Waleed and his investment company, Kingdom Holding Co., didn't respond to requests to comment.

On Sunday, shares of Kingdom, which trade on the Saudi stock exchange, fell 7.6%.

In a statement posted on the Saudi stock exchange's website on Sunday, Kingdom Holding's chief executive said the company has received the support of the government and would continue to operate ""business as usual.""

Prince al-Waleed has been a familiar figure in Western business and financial circles for more than a quarter of a century, having backed iconic U.S. companies such as General Motors Co., Apple Inc. and Citigroup Inc. More recently, he has invested heavily in young technology companies including Twitter Inc. and Lyft Inc.

One of the prince's most high-profile partnerships is with Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates. The investment firms of the two billionaires teamed up a decade ago to take luxury hotel operator Four Seasons Holdings Inc. private for $3.8 billion. Four Seasons spokeswoman Sarah Tuite said it was ""business as usual"" and that the ""matter does not affect the day-to-day operations of Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts.""

The prince shot to prominence in the U.S. in 1991 after buying shares of a predecessor to Citigroup. The deal eventually made him one of the bank's largest individual shareholders. He remained a major backer of Citi as the firm's shares plunged in value during the 2008 financial crisis and participated in an international capital raise by the bank during that time.

In March, Prince al-Waleed hosted a dinner for Citigroup Chief Executive Michael Corbat in the Saudi capital, where they discussed ""future plans of the company,"" according to Kingdom's website. One month later, the bank received approval from Saudi Arabia's regulator to operate a capital-markets business in the kingdom after a long absence.

The prince's desert tent in Riyadh is a regular stop for U.S. company executives, investors and foreign dignitaries. Many of these events are documented on Kingdom's website.

Last month, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and other senior bank executives met Prince al-Waleed in Riyadh, according to the website. Goldman advised Kingdom on its deal to acquire a stake in Banque Saudi Fransi from Credit Agricole SA.

In 2015, executives from Snap Inc. including CEO Evan Spiegel met with the prince about ""future potential business cooperation"" while the disappearing-message app company was in the midst of a funding round. However, Kingdom never invested in Snap as a private company and didn't purchase shares in its public offering, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The prince has also been a longtime investor in Rupert Murdoch's media empire, first investing in News Corp in 1997 and eventually becoming the second-largest holder of voting shares outside of the Murdoch family.

He remained a supporter of Mr. Murdoch's, even as News Corp became embroiled in a phone hacking scandal in London and was subsequently split into two companies -- News Corp and 21st Century Fox -- in 2013. Two years later, he sold the bulk of his stake in News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal. He is also no longer a major shareholder in Fox.

In 2010, News Corp paid $70 million for a stake in Rotana Group, a Middle Eastern entertainment company primarily owned by Prince al-Waleed's firm. Since the split, Fox has continued to own a small stake in Rotana.

That year, the prince bought a $500 million stake in GM during the carmaker's initial public offering."
Ctit Group,Stock Derivatives Trading Struggles at Banks," Nov 4, 2017",1,"Waning stock volatility is pressuring the equity derivatives business, suppressing revenue and driving traders out of what was once a key Wall Street moneymaker.

Revenue in an equity derivatives business that focuses on listed options shrank by 41% in the U.S. and by 28% globally during the first half of 2017 from the year-earlier period, according to data firm Coalition, which tracked 12 of the biggest banks in the world. The number of employees in equity derivatives at banks has contracted by about 10% since 2012, Coalition data also show.

An extraordinary calm in markets has choked the trades that typically funnel through banks' derivatives desks. Banks such as Deutsche Bank AG, Barclays PLC and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. blamed lower revenues on depressed volatility when recently reporting earnings.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. pulled back from U.S. options market-making on exchanges, a spokeswoman for the firm said Thursday. It is the latest to withdraw from the business of continuously buying and selling contracts on venues using automated programs.

The business isn't a large part of Goldman's overall equity derivatives revenue and the decision to retreat was driven by the high costs related to connecting to the many options exchanges, and how retail orders are handled, among other market structure issues, a person familiar with the matter said. The firm will still provide options services for clients, the spokeswoman said.

""While Goldman Sachs will no longer hold the on-exchange options market-maker designation, we remain committed to the options business and will continue to offer clients the full range of relevant products, such as access to listed options across all US exchanges and access to our principal liquidity,"" the spokeswoman said.

The number of equity derivatives contracts that have traded world-wide has dwindled since 2011, data from the World Federation of Exchanges show, as central banks world-wide propped up markets, damping investors' desire to use derivatives like options to hedge or protect holdings. Derivatives also face competition from quantitative trading, in which computers help develop strategies.

""With lower volatility this year, we're seeing less of those trades come through,"" Coalition's research director Amrit Shahani said. ""It's a vicious cycle.""

OptionMetrics LLC founder David Hait said investors tend to think of options as insurance for stock bets. With U.S. equities in an eight-year bull market, people are asking, ""What do I need an option for?"" he said.

The so-called flow equity derivatives business at banks can also include over-the-counter derivatives and swaps. Traders help research and execute trades using derivatives, while sales employees contact clients, such as hedge funds and pension funds, to suggest moves, collecting commissions when the trades are done.

The situation looks more dire for some banks. In the first half of 2017, revenue from Barclays's U.S. equity derivatives flow trading slumped to less than half of the $200 million it brought in the first half of 2016, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Banks rarely break out this business from their equities broadly. Barclays declined to comment on the drop in revenue.

Analysts pressed Barclays in an October earnings call on why the firm underperformed peers in stocks. Chief Executive Jes Staley acknowledged that the bank was ""surprised"" by the decline in their flow equity derivatives business. A main area of underperformance in equities was in derivatives, Barclays Group Finance Director Tushar Morzaria said.

The decline was largely driven by its exposure to individual stocks, the person familiar with the matter said. Options bets on specific companies have been one of the hardest hit areas, as investors gravitate toward passive investments and algorithmic strategies. Trading individual U.S. stock options has fallen steadily since 2006 and is near its record low of 49% of total U.S. options volume, according to Tabb Group research through the third quarter.

Bright spots include trading on ETFs and indexes, which dominated U.S. options activity last quarter, Tabb data show. Structured products -- investment packages put together by banks that often include derivatives -- were also lucrative for some firms.

Equity derivatives account for a tiny slice of the derivatives held by U.S. banks, which held $2.9 trillion in notional amount as of the second quarter, compared with over $185 trillion across derivatives on assets including interest-rate products, data from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency show.

After 16 years of trading options during which he ascended to managing director at Bank of America Corp. and Deutsche Bank, Zahid Biviji left Wall Street this year.

He cited fewer opportunities in the space, partly caused by regulations imposed after the financial crisis. He founded Wapanda, a phone app that will connect riders with taxis and ride-sharing services like Lyft. ""I had a good run making money,"" Mr. Biviji said, noting that ""a lot of the derivatives business is in survival mode right now.""

Some traders have pivoted to a less-regulated asset: cryptocurrencies.

""For the most part, you're not going to get wealthy like you could in the late '90s or early 2000s"" in equity derivatives, said Arthur Hayes, the Hong Kong-based co-founder and chief of Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange, who traded derivatives at Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank. ""In cryptos, you actually get to do what you like to do: trade."""
Ctit Group,U.S. Banks Seek Nafta Data Rule," Nov 3, 2017",0,"As talks on a new North American Free Trade Agreement heat up over auto parts and agriculture, U.S. financial firms are quietly pushing for another, less tangible change: the free movement of data across borders.

A proposal, presented by the U.S. at Nafta renegotiations in September, would keep any government in the new trade pact from demanding banks or insurers store customer data on local servers, say people familiar with the text.

It is a long-coveted goal for financial firms, who say this could potentially save them millions of dollars in technology-storage costs.

Firms such as Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and MetLife Inc. are among those behind the push. They say it is pricey to comply with data rules in countries where they operate because of requirements to maintain servers within each country's borders for privacy and other reasons. They also worry about potential risks in countries where protection against hacking might be less robust, firms say.

""For the financial services industries, data flow commitments really are a must-have in Nafta,"" said Steve Simchak, director of international affairs for the American Insurance Association, a trade group that represents 320 U.S. insurers.

Getting free flow of data enshrined in the pact would not only affect data between the U.S., Canada and Mexico, it would create a template for future trade deals that could include more jurisdictions. The Trump administration has backed bilateral trade agreements with Asia-Pacific countries and with the U.K. when the country completes a planned separation from the European Union.

Banks and insurers today operate data centers in dozens of countries, and often must call on local offices even when deals are being negotiated in hubs such as New York, London and Singapore, slowing down transactions.

""These are global companies,"" said Peter Matheson, managing director at the U.S. Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association trade group. He said negotiators today need to consider technological advances that didn't exist when Nafta went into effect: ""There were no such things as clouds in 1994.""

For Citigroup, which already operates 20 regional data centers, guaranteeing free flow of cross-border data means the bank could avoid building more. Indonesia, for example, has sought to require banks to onshore both their data centers and backups, Citigroup said in a letter to the U.S. Trade Representative on a separate matter.

Citigroup Chief Executive Michael Corbat has been outspoken on data issues, and has in the past discussed localization requirements with Indonesian officials, people familiar with those talks said.

""The movement of data is no less important to the global economy than the movement of money,"" Mr. Corbat said in 2014 speech in Barcelona.

Banks say local data storage can cost them millions of dollars in hardware and software costs and the labor required for local offices, say people familiar with the industry.

Privacy Differences

Cause Confusion

Currently, the rules that govern privacy in the Nafta countries diverge widely, causing confusion among some financial services firms.

Some parts of Canada's Bank Act, which regulates the industry, and guidelines issued by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions could be interpreted to require firms to keep their books and records in the country.

Laws in some Mexican states say customers have the right to block access to data by third parties, which banks say can inhibit movement of information within organizations.

The push for free data flows goes back to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, negotiated by the Obama administration, which excluded financial services from a provision allowing U.S. companies to store their data anywhere they pleased.

Following an intense push by banking groups, Obama administration trade officials agreed to try to include banks in future agreements. After President Donald Trump abandoned the TPP, administration officials have told industry groups that they would continue the push for unrestricted data movement in its new trade negotiations."
Ctit Group,China Sells Dollar Bonds at Yields Near Treasurys," Oct 27, 2017",1,"China sold $2 billion in bonds at record-low interest rates that were slightly above what the U.S. pays to borrow in the debt markets, a sign of investors' confidence in the financial health of the world's second-largest economy.

A surge of investor demand for the country's first U.S. dollar-denominated debt sale in 13 years enabled China to price its five-year bonds to yield 2.196%, or just 0.15 percentage point over comparable U.S. Treasury notes at the time of the pricing.

The country's 10-year bonds were priced to yield 2.687%, or 0.25 percentage point above Treasury yields. Bankers received more than $22 billion in orders from investors and allocated a third of China's bonds to investors in Europe. The bulk went to Asian institutions, and some were purchased by investors in the Americas.

The bond sale, which followed this week's conclusion of China's twice-a-decade Communist Party congress, was carefully managed to achieve an outcome that would send a strong message about China to the global markets.

The $2 billion offering was small by the standards of the U.S. and other major sovereign-debt issuers. Coupled with China's long absence from the global capital markets, it created a scarcity value for the country's bonds. Many investors, led by Chinese institutions with dollars to invest outside the mainland, were eager to own the securities, and they helped push down yields, which move inversely to prices.

""Investors' view of China is at its strongest point"" in years, said David Loevinger, managing director of Emerging Markets Sovereign Research at TCW Group, referring to what he called ""super-tight spreads"" on the new bonds.

With China's new leadership in place and U.S. President Donald Trump preparing to visit Beijing, ""China wants to show that it is an equal power to the U.S.,"" Mr. Loevinger added.

China had said it has no significant need for external financing. The country runs a large trade surplus and has over $3 trillion in foreign-currency reserves, including a big stash of U.S. Treasurys.

The main goal of the bond sale was to create low interest-rate benchmarks that Chinese state-owned enterprises and private corporations, which are more-regular issuers of offshore debt, can reference when tapping the global bond markets for funding needs.

China had tapped 10 large banks, including Bank of China Ltd., Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings PLC, to help drum up buyers for its sovereign bonds. The securities were marketed primarily to investors in Asia and Europe.

Some investors were turned away by the meager yields offered by China. Edwin Gutierrez, head of emerging-market sovereign debt at Aberdeen Standard Investment, which has $758 billion of assets under management, said he passed on the China deal.

""This is not targeted for me,"" Mr. Gutierrez said, noting that the average yield on emerging-market bonds is in excess of 5%. If he bought the Chinese bond, it would be ""an incredible yield give-up for global emerging-market managers like me,"" he said.

Earlier Thursday, banks circulated price guidance for the securities, launching the five-year bond sale at suggested yields of 0.3 to 0.4 percentage point above Treasurys. They offered China's 10-year bonds at 0.4 to 0.5 percentage point over the U.S. yield benchmark. By the afternoon in Asia, strong investor demand led bankers to move their yield guidance closer to Treasury yields. It is a common strategy for bankers to initially offer more generous yields and later sell the debt at much lower yields to demonstrate strong demand.

The bond sale follows credit-rating downgrades of China this year by international ratings firms Moody's Investors Service and S&P Global. Both grade the country the equivalent of an A+ rating, which is several notches below their rating on the U.S., and the raters have pointed to what they consider rising economic and financial risks in China.

China's Finance Ministry proceeded with its bond sale without getting the securities rated, and in a statement this week said the international raters have misread China's economic development and growth potential. It said investors in the international debt markets would make an objective assessment of China's creditworthiness.

In marketing China's bonds earlier this week, investment bankers provided several 10-year yield benchmarks that investors could use to compare the country's relative risk. The comparisons included 10-year U.S. dollar bonds issued by Israel in September 2016, which were recently yielding 0.41 percentage point above U.S. Treasurys. Israel has the same credit rating as China.

Another benchmark for comparison was German government-backed development bank KfW Group, which in April 2015 issued $3 billion in U.S. dollar bonds. Those securities recently yielded 0.05 percentage point over 10-year U.S. Treasurys. Germany has triple-A credit ratings from the major ratings firms.

Some analysts said the comparisons were surprising because they were made against U.S. dollar bonds from a different region.

China is the latest developing country to tap the international bond market, where investors' thirst for higher yields has sparked record issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated debt this year."
Ctit Group,These Lenders Receive Too Much Credit," Oct 25, 2017",1,"Shares of credit-card lenders have recovered sharply over the past two months on optimism that rising defaults will soon stabilize. The relief may prove premature.

After a weak showing for most of the year, Synchrony Financial and Alliance Data Systems, which specialize in store-brand cards that target less creditworthy borrowers, are both up about 6% since the end of August, when default fears were peaking. Capital One Financial, which also specializes in riskier borrowers, has risen 13% over the same period.

True, net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans declined in the third quarter from the previous period at all three lenders, but that is a typical seasonal pattern. Compared with a year earlier, the net charge-off rates are sharply higher at all three. Delinquencies, a leading indicator of future charge-offs, rose at all three.

At Alliance Data and Synchrony, management gave reassuring guidance, saying they believe the ""normalization"" of credit, after years of historically low loss rates, has almost run its course.

But the real lesson from 2017 is that these forecasts should be taken with a grain of salt. Following a yearslong boom in credit-card and other borrowing, lenders have imperfect visibility into how loans will perform. Capital One had to raise its default guidance for the year twice. This month, Citigroup said losses on its own store-brand cards were running ahead of expectations.

Capital One said Tuesday that losses will run to the high end of its previous forecast and that domestic card net charge-offs will be in the ""high 4% to around 5% range"" this year. Meanwhile, on a conference call with analysts, the company declined to give clear guidance on 2018 charge-offs.

The three companies are trading at an average 11 times forward earnings, a slight discount to their five-year average of 12 times. Of those, Capital One is actually trading a bit above its five-year average. With little certainty that the worst is behind them, the price is too high for these lenders."
Ctit Group,Auto Makers Win Investor Favor," Oct 25, 2017",1,"Wall Street is finally rewarding Detroit's old guard auto companies for the direction they are taking, leading them to garner strong stock gains even as the car market is softening.

The industry developments Tuesday highlight a strategy shift that is well under way in the Motor City. Caught off guard by rapid developments and sizable investments in driverless cars and other innovative transportation ideas coming from Silicon Valley tech giants, including Alphabet Inc., Tesla Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc., domestic auto companies have fought back by slimming down or dumping old lines of business and focusing on efforts to reshape the way people get from Point A to B.

On Tuesday, General Motors Co. recorded one of its worst quarterly net incomes since filing for bankruptcy in 2009, spilling nearly $3 billion in red ink during the July through September period.

GM's performance is primarily due to decisions to dump its unprofitable European operations and pare back on low-margin businesses, such as passenger-car production and sales to rental companies. A strong balance sheet, allows the company to plow resources into autonomous driving and electric vehicles.

Delphi Automotive PLC, meanwhile, purchased a popular driverless-car developer, the latest attempt to supercharge the American auto-supply sector's role in reinventing personal transportation.

Ahead of Ford Motor Co.'s third-quarter results Thursday. Chief Executive Jim Hackett unveiled a management shake-up after five months at the helm. Mr. Hackett has said he wants to speed decision making and ""attack"" costs at Ford, targeting $14 billion in annual savings within five years, aimed at streamlining the core business so it can steer more investment toward driverless cars and electric vehicles.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, meanwhile, reported a 50% increase in net earnings, but sales and North American profit growth flatlined over the summer. Still, the company maintained an ambitious outlook and higher-than-expected cash inflows helped chip away a debt load that is seen as a hurdle to the Italian-American auto maker's pursuit of a merger partner.

Citigroup analyst Itay Michaeli said GM's ability to post an 8.3% margin in North America amid a 26% production cut and ""downturn-like conditions,"" demonstrates the type of resiliency that cyclical domestic car companies once lacked.

Revenue took a hit, falling 12% to $33.6 billion. The shrinking top line reflects GM Chief Executive Mary Barra's strategy to pursue profits and game-changing tech over market share.

GM shares touched $46.76 Tuesday, with a $67.5 billion market capitalization representing the highest value since its 2010 initial public offering and an $11 billion lead over Tesla, which is under pressure to launch a mass-market electric car. GM shares closed at $46.48.

GM Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens said he was ""pleased"" investors are rewarding progress on the core business and future technology bets. Mr. Stevens said he believes investors are rewarding ""actions we've been taking over the last number of years to build a stronger, more resilient core business.""

Meanwhile, Fiat Chrysler has benefited by doubling down on production of popular SUVs and trucks. Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said the company will remain disciplined once it climbs back to positive net cash.

""I don't want to chase rainbows,"" Mr. Marchionne told financial analysts on a conference call, saying memories of being starved of capital a decade ago after Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy are still fresh. ""The scars that this last crisis caused I still have,"" he said.

Shares of Fiat Chrysler closed at $17.45 Tuesday, a 5.4% increase, one of the highest points since the company's formation.

Ford's market value, which is roughly 25% lower than GM, has barely budged during the short tenure of its new CEO. The shake-up on Tuesday led to the surprise departure of John Casesa, a former investment banker and star auto analyst who was charged with running strategy in 2015 under ex-CEO Mark Fields. The heads of marketing, quality and human resources all elected to leave the company as well.

Ford's board installed Mr. Hackett in May after ousting Mr. Fields amid questions about Ford's direction and culture. Earlier this month, Mr. Hackett briefed investors on broad plans to accelerate Ford's development of autonomous vehicles and electric cars, though his outline left some wanting more specifics.

Delphi's $450 million acquisition of Boston-based NuTonomy Inc. could help the Michigan-headquartered company bring autonomous vehicles to market by the turn of the decade. This is a boost for Detroit's car companies, which have deep ties with Delphi dating to the days when it was a subsidiary of GM.

Delphi acquired other startups in recent years, including its 2015 purchase of Carnegie Mellon University spinoff Ottomatika Inc., another company that provides software for self-driving cars. This further changes Delphi's profile in the industry from a company that many analysts saw as ripe for acquisition into a potential power player.

The deal for NuTonomy -- a spinoff of MIT that attracted attention with its public driverless-car tests in Singapore -- adds top robotic talent to Delphi's growing stable of acquisitions and partnerships as it looks to create an entire autonomous vehicle system that it can sell to auto makers. For NuTonomy, Delphi's scale provides leverage to hasten the industrialization of self-driving technology, allowing it to put its stamp on software installed in millions of future vehicles.

Delphi wants to join with auto makers on speeding up autonomous-car research and offer its own off-the-shelf solution for car companies that don't have deep pockets."
Ctit Group,World News: Buying Corporate Debt Spurs Bubble Fears," Oct 25, 2017",1,"In the spring of 2016, traders at Germany's central bank sat down with investment bank advisers in Frankfurt to discuss a once unthinkable project: how to build a multibillion-euro corporate-debt fund.

Fast forward 18 months and the European Central Bank has changed the face of the euro corporate-debt market, having bought almost 120 billion euros ($141 billion) of these securities. Financing costs for companies have fallen to the point where junk-rated firms can borrow at similar yields to U.S. government debt, prompting concerns it is fueling a bubble.

Few investors think a bubble will burst Thursday, when the ECB is widely expected to announce plans to trim its asset purchases of 60 billion euros a month. But the fact that corporate bonds now trade around levels not seen since before the financial crisis makes many uneasy about the market's long-term trajectory.

""When the ECB steps back, it increases vulnerability in the market,"" said Hans Lorenzen, head of European credit strategy at Citigroup Inc, who is recommending clients dial down their exposure to credit.

Global central banks for years bought trillions of dollars' worth of government debt under so-called quantitative-easing programs, or QE, in an effort to lift inflation. That boosted corporate bonds, whose prices are heavily influenced by government debt.

But never before had a central bank made such large-scale purchases in the corporate-credit market, where debt defaults are more common and trading is often patchy. That changed in March 2016 when the ECB announced it would start buying investment-grade euro corporate debt.

It was also a learning curve for investment banks that underwrite and sell corporate debt.

The Bundesbank, for instance, doesn't attend roadshows where companies talk to investors ahead of new bond deals, according to people familiar with the matter, or discuss pricing. Instead, investment bankers would send a spreadsheet with bond details to ensure they were eligible for the program along with pricing information that would form the basis for their decision, those people said.

""We won't buy at any price. But then again, we do have quantity targets,"" said Elisa Newby, head of market operations at the Bank of Finland, one of six regional central banks tasked with carrying out the purchases.

Investors say the central bank purchases have generally progressed smoothly. But they have also drawn criticism from some quarters.

The Bundesbank -- the largest buyer in the overall QE program, as well as a stern critic -- warned in a July report that buying company debt opens the ECB to losses and may distort the market.

For its part, the ECB has noted the positive effects in lowering companies' financing costs, including those that don't rely on bond markets for their funding.

As the ECB bought high-grade debt, investors pushed into riskier securities in search of returns.

The ECB's buying has also watered down some traditional creditor protections. Its rules state it can't buy bonds with so-called step-up clauses, which automatically jack up debt interest payments if a company is downgraded by ratings firms.

All this has prompted some credit investors to take precautions. Colin Purdie, head of investment-grade credit at Aviva Investors, prefers to own bank bonds -- which the ECB doesn't buy -- over utility bonds that it has bought and could be more vulnerable to it scaling back."
Ctit Group,"AmEx Mission: Regain Brand's Cachet --- New CEO will have to deal with increasing competition from banks, fintech firms"," Oct 21, 2017",1,"Entrepreneur Christopher Burch has been a loyal user of American Express Co. cards since 1979. This year, he switched almost all of his spending to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s Sapphire Reserve card.

Regaining customers like Mr. Burch, who made the Forbes list of wealthiest Americans in 2014, is one of the big challenges for incoming AmEx Chairman and Chief Executive Stephen Squeri. Named successor to longtime chief Kenneth Chenault on Wednesday, Mr. Squeri will take over as the card giant stresses it is building momentum after a recent rough stretch.

The reality is more complicated. AmEx is still dealing with rising competition from banks and nimble fintech firms such as PayPal Holdings Inc., the Silicon Valley payments company whose market value recently eclipsed AmEx's. Investors aren't clear, meanwhile, on where long-term revenue growth will come from, or how AmEx will deal with potential disruption to traditional payments channels from new, mobile approaches.

When asked about competition at a shareholder lunch last year, Mr. Chenault put the situation in a historical context, according to a person at the meeting. But, Mr. Chenault added, the firm was under attack.

AmEx issues cards to consumers and businesses, both credit cards and ones that must be paid off monthly. It runs its own card network and makes loans to people and companies.

The firm has spent recent years fending off rivals on several fronts, which has worried some investors. Mr. Chenault's departure is ""good timing from a stock perspective but . . . there are still challenges ahead,"" said Don Fandetti, a Wells Fargo & Co. analyst.

Top of the to-do list for Mr. Squeri: Regain the cachet of the AmEx brand, both for millennials who don't view it the same way as their parents and for established customers who have been wooed by banks offering better services and more perks.

As competitive pressures have mounted, AmEx has lost market share to banks and to card networks such as Visa Inc. AmEx's market share of total U.S. credit-card purchase volume fell to 22.9% last year, according to Nomura Instinet, from 25.4% in 2015. It was about 26% as recently as 2014.

The slip has in large part been the result of several co-branded cards that AmEx has lost since 2015, including Costco Wholesale Corp. and JetBlue Airways Corp.

Costco was viewed as a huge loss for AmEx by many shareholders, but the company's earnings are starting to rebound from that. ""It turned out the decision on Costco was 100% the right decision,"" Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the largest AmEx shareholder, told The Wall Street Journal in an interview. ""Everybody thought it was a mistake at the time,"" but he said that since then, ""the progress is just terrific.""

Mr. Chenault also defended his tenure, noting how he overcame numerous challenges. ""I've managed through three crises [including] 9/11 and the financial crisis,"" he said in an interview. ""The repositioning of what we did with co-brands was very impressive.""

Asked about the Sapphire Reserve card, Mr. Chenault said AmEx has been ""very focused on innovating"" its Platinum card and that the card is having ""the best time ever.""

To dig out of the company's slump and boost revenue, Mr. Chenault leaned more on lending. That was a reversal from the years after the financial crisis when he was wary of this business.

In the wake of the meltdown, Mr. Chenault opted to make the company less banklike and stay focused on revenue generated from the fees that merchants pay it when customers use AmEx cards.

The company also put roughly $1 billion into a division that focused mostly on the prepaid-card market, according to a former executive. But the effort failed to take off.

It wasn't until late 2014 when Mr. Chenault recognized the disadvantage AmEx faced when competing with big lenders, according to the person. Negotiations were under way for the Costco credit card, and the deal appeared to be on the ropes. Each time AmEx sweetened its bid, Costco told the company it needed to do more. AmEx was ultimately outbid by an estimated $1 billion, the person said. Citigroup Inc. won the business.

The jolt changed Mr. Chenault's thinking on lending. At a 2015 meeting, he asked division heads how much revenue and profit they could deliver in the next two to three years to fill the void left by Costco. One executive said the firm could build U.S. loan balances by 12%. Mr. Chenault's response, said a person familiar with the meeting: ""What would it take to make it even bigger?""

AmEx's lending push helped improve earnings this year, but shareholders are becoming worried about future credit losses. The firm's total provisions for losses jumped 53% in the third quarter from a year earlier. Competing in premium cards can be costly, too; the company continued to increase expenses in the third quarter.

""Their strategy has shifted to one that relies a bit more on lending, and it remains to be seen what the full effects of that will be in the next downturn,"" said David Hochstim, a director and senior research analyst at ClearBridge Investments, an AmEx shareholder."
Ctit Group,American Express Chief to Leave --- Credit-card market has changed greatly since he took over; Squeri to be next CEO," Oct 19, 2017",0,"Kenneth Chenault, the head of American Express Co. and one of the country's most prominent African-American corporate leaders, will step down as chairman and chief executive Feb. 1, capping a 16-year run at the iconic card company as it grapples with a new wave of competition.

The 66-year-old executive will be succeeded as CEO by Stephen Squeri, a three-decade AmEx veteran who previously ran its division in charge of corporate cards. As vice chairman since 2015, Mr. Squeri, 58, had spent more time meeting with shareholders, leading many to believe he was on the shortlist to be the next chief executive.

AmEx shares slipped 0.5% to $91.60 in after-hours trading despite the company reporting stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue for the third quarter and raising its profit guidance for the year.

Mr. Chenault's departure comes after a tumultuous period in which he fought to revive AmEx's fortunes following the loss of a key partnership with Costco Wholesale Corp. and as the company's pre-eminent product, the Platinum card, came under attack from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s Sapphire Reserve card.

The Long Island, N.Y., native had a stellar run for most of his time atop the New York-based company. But AmEx's recent travails have cast a shadow over his tenure -- something he fought to escape before stepping aside.

Despite a booming credit-card market that recently surpassed $1 trillion in balances, AmEx has ceded market share and some shareholders have questioned where long-term growth will come from. Many senior executives have left the company, and Mr. Chenault suffered a personal loss with the unexpected death in 2015 of his would-be successor, AmEx President Ed Gilligan.

The company's main focus in recent years has been ramping up lending to consumers and small businesses while also searching for new ways to appeal to millennials, many of whom crave different kinds of rewards and are more comfortable moving money with their phones than a credit card.

Still, AmEx's stock has rebounded of late as the company addressed some of shareholders' biggest concerns. In the past year, the shares have rallied more than 50%, compared with a 28% rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In recent months, shareholders say Mr. Chenault has appeared more upbeat and confident in his meetings with them.

In early June, the company said it won the rights to become the exclusive issuer of the Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. credit cards starting in 2018, beating out Citigroup Inc.

""We're completing a two-year turnaround ahead of plan and getting ready to start a new chapter,"" Mr. Chenault said on a conference call with analysts Wednesday. He added that the process of finding a new CEO had been under way for about five years and included candidates from inside and outside the company. He called Mr. Squeri ""an excellent strategist and a strong leader.""

One key constituent consulted by the company was Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the largest AmEx shareholder with a 17% stake. A shareholder in the company for 53 years, Mr. Buffett said Wednesday that he had spoken to both Mr. Chenault and Mr. Squeri and in an interview added that the company had ""made a terrific choice.""

""We talked a lot about this change over the last few months, and I'm 100% on board,"" Mr. Buffett said.

In an interview, Mr. Squeri said there would be some organizational changes at the company in the next three months as Mr. Chenault prepares to retire.

Few would argue that the credit-card market has changed dramatically since Mr. Chenault took over in 2001. Two of the most significant changes: increasing competition from banks and more emphasis on rewards for consumers.

Since the end of 2001, AmEx shares have beaten the market, rising 195%, compared with a 131% rise in the Dow and a 23% bump for the S&P 500 financial-stock index, according to FactSet. In the last three years, however, gains have been tougher to come by, with AmEx shares rallying only 12%, compared with a 41% rise in the Dow and a 45% move in S&P 500 financial stocks.

AmEx has traditionally focused on cardholders who pay their bills in full each month, but that means the company doesn't typically generate the interest revenue needed to offer as much in points and other quantifiable rewards that some big banks have been doling out in recent years.

Some former executives have said Mr. Chenault kept the company on the sidelines while rewards cards boomed, focusing instead on projects such as prepaid cards popular with less affluent customers.

""We've been in this lending business for a long time,"" Mr. Chenault said in an interview. ""We were able to come out of crisis faster and stronger than anyone else.""

Mr. Chenault in recent months has been telling shareholders and analysts about other cards that started out hot and then fizzled out. In fact, his view was vindicated somewhat this year when J.P. Morgan scaled back its Sapphire Reserve offering by lowering its initial sign-up bonus amid concerns that the card's initial terms might not make enough money for J.P. Morgan.

""Everybody doubted us and we're delivering,"" said Mr. Chenault at an investor meeting in July, according to a person who attended the meeting.

Mr. Buffett said the company was right to part with Costco, even though it was a short-term hit to the company. ""Every bank in the world would kill for their credit experience,"" he said.

Chenault Among

Few Black CEOs

Kenneth Chenault's retirement as chief executive at American Express Co. will reduce the number of black CEOs of Fortune 500 companies by a quarter.

Mr. Chenault's exit occurs as many large companies are showing greater concern for diversity. But even as top executives and boards devote more time and resources to improving ethnic and gender representation in their ranks, the number of black CEOs has remained relatively stagnant.

The other black CEOs at Fortune 500 businesses are Roger W. Ferguson, Jr. at TIAA, Kenneth C. Frazier of Merck & Co. and J.C. Penney Co.'s Marvin R. Ellison.

Mr. Chenault's rise to the top slot at AmEx in 2001 coincided with a relative surge in the number of prominent black CEOs. In 1999, Fannie Mae appointed Franklin Raines as its CEO. That same year, Maytag named Lloyd Ward chief executive.

Richard Zweigenhaft, a professor of psychology at Guilford College in Greensboro, N.C., who studies ethnicity and social mobility, says the period is an example of ""one of the ironies of diversity.""

""The corporate elite had shown that it valued diversity. Once barriers were broken, the presence of some had decreased the pressure to increase the numbers [of top-level black executives],"" he said."
Ctit Group,Morgan Stanley Thrives --- Wealth management's strength delivers best showing for the first nine months since '07," Oct 18, 2017",0,"Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman's outsize bet on wealth management is paying off in a big way.

The firm's army of brokers -- many of them far from Wall Street, scattered at 600 offices from Eugene, Ore., to Alpharetta, Ga. -- more than compensated for a continued slowdown in trading and set Morgan Stanley on track for its most profitable year in a decade.

Morgan Stanley's $5.5 billion in net income for the first nine months of the year is its best showing since 2007. In the third quarter, the firm posted earnings of 93 cents a share and revenue of $9.2 billion, which were both higher than a year earlier and easily beat analysts' expectations.

Morgan Stanley, along with Goldman Sachs Group Inc., rounded out big banks' quarterly earnings Tuesday. The five biggest Wall Street firms all improved from a year ago, each relying on a different cocktail to overcome continued torpor in the once-lucrative securities business. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. leaned on commercial lending and credit cards. Bank of America Corp. was aided by lending and expense discipline, while investment gains and merger fees helped Goldman.

Morgan Stanley's engine increasingly is its wealth-management business, which oversees $2.3 trillion for 3.5 million Americans and continues to rake in assets. It is the centerpiece of Mr. Gorman's effort to turn Morgan Stanley from Wall Street's problem child to a steadier firm prized by investors, largely by focusing on wealth and asset management.

Those businesses are ascendant on Wall Street. Baby boomers have hit their peak earning years and are managing for retirement, while the number of millionaires looking for advice and concierge services is growing.

Meanwhile, postcrisis rules and quiet markets have shackled trading desks and raised the cost of the capital they need to operate.

The boom in wealth management extends beyond Wall Street. Regional brokerage Edward Jones recently passed the $1 trillion mark in total client assets.

At Morgan Stanley, the firm's multiyear purchase of Citigroup Inc.'s brokerage, Smith Barney, is now fully integrated, and executives have squeezed much of the obvious savings from the business. Quarterly revenue of $4.2 billion and a profit margin of 26.5% in the quarter were both records.

""The obvious low-hanging fruit is off the table,"" Mr. Gorman said Tuesday. ""But these businesses are scale businesses,"" so profitability should improve as account balances grow.

A key initiative is pushing mortgages and other loans to wealth-management clients, which hit a record $76 billion at the end of the quarter. Another is adding digital offerings: Morgan Stanley is rolling out a robo adviser for smaller account balances -- hopefully without losing the loyalty of its 15,800 human brokers.

The old model of charging clients commissions to buy and sell stocks is falling away, with Morgan Stanley and rivals embracing a model where advisers charge a flat fee to manage portfolios.

Morgan Stanley's assets in this type of account topped $1 trillion for the first time last quarter, up from $855 billion a year ago. Bank of America, which encompasses the giant brokerage Merrill Lynch, also surpassed $1 trillion in fee-based assets in the quarter, up from $871 billion a year ago. These accounts face fewer regulations and appear to better align brokers' incentives with those of clients. And because they don't rely on clients to buy and sell stocks and bonds to generate fees, they are more resilient in calm markets, when trading appetite falls. They are also less vulnerable to the shift from actively managed portfolios to passive approaches.

Like Morgan Stanley, Bank of America's wealth division also had a strong quarter. Its business posted a pretax profit margin of 27%. Morgan Stanley's return on equity, which is a key measure of how profitably it invests shareholders' money, stood at 9.6% in the quarter and 9.8% through the first nine months of the year. Mr. Gorman has targeted a minimum of 9% for the full year.

""We saw the same issues that most others did,"" Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said.

Revenue from stock-trading was flat at $1.9 billion. As Wall Street's leader in that business, with a 30% share of fees, Morgan Stanley has little room to grow.

But guarding its turf remains a priority for Edward Pick, who now runs the firm's overall trading operation."
Ctit Group,Wells Fargo Trips as BofA Cruises --- Lender's profit sinks 19% amid legal issues; Bank of America's net is biggest in six years," Oct 14, 2017",1,"Wells Fargo & Co. and Bank of America Corp. reported results that benefited from low unemployment and gradually rising interest rates.

But their performance diverged from there, marking the strongest evidence yet that the two big consumer lenders have changed places, with Bank of America emerging as a budding investor darling and Wells Fargo taking the role of problem child following a series of missteps.

Wells Fargo said Friday that third-quarter profit tumbled 19% from a year ago, due to continued fallout from its sales-practice scandal and fresh legal issues. The San Francisco-based bank said revenue also fell from a year earlier, while its loan portfolio shrank for a third consecutive quarter. Wells Fargo continued to struggle with higher expenses in the wake of the scandal and a newly disclosed $1 billion litigation charge tied to investigations into crisis-era mortgage-market practices.

Wells Fargo's shares fell 2.8% to $53.69 on Friday.

Bank of America, on the other hand, is putting once-intractable problems behind it. The lender reported its highest quarterly profit in six years. The bank's revenue rose, as it did at peers J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. earlier in the week. Even a decline in Bank of America's trading revenue didn't dent overall results much, as gains in interest income and continued cost-cutting helped offset the weakness. Its shares gained 1.5% to $25.83.

Wells Fargo, a former investor favorite that once surpassed J.P. Morgan as the most valuable U.S. bank by market capitalization, has slipped behind Bank of America to the No. 3 ranking on this basis.

While Wells Fargo by some measures remains the more profitable bank, the two lenders' revenues are now about equal, with Wells Fargo's roughly $87 million advantage down from nearly $900 million in the second quarter of 2016 before the sales problems emerged.

Led by Chief Executive Timothy Sloan, Wells Fargo reported that net income during the quarter slipped below $5 billion for the first timein five years, due in large part to the $1 billion it accrued for a previously disclosed mortgage probeover residential mortgage-backed securities. The bank is likely to settle with the Justice Department in coming months, finance chief John Shrewsberry said in an interview.

While Wells Fargo suffered a rough quarter, shareholder Hank Smith said he is optimistic about the banking sector overall. That, he said, is because of economic growth, slowly rising interest rates and the expectation of less onerous regulations under the Trump administration.

""While the quarter was disappointing, it wasn't a dramatic disappointment,"" said Mr. Smith, co-chief investment officer of Haverford Trust Co., which owns 2.7 million Wells Fargo shares.

The biggest reason for the shifting fortunes of the two banks is the declining number of regulatory issues at Bank of America and the increasing tally at Wells Fargo.As recently as 2014, Bank of America's results were dogged by tens of billions of dollars in penalties over financial-crisis-era issues. Since then, the company's legal problems have eased and it has made a concerted effort to cut costs and focus on safer businesses such as lending to consumers with good credit.

Wells Fargo didn't face as many regulatory fines until cross-selling abuses by branch stafferuptedin September 2016,with employees creating potentially3.5 million fake accounts.The bank fired 5,300 employees over five years related to the sales problems.

Two months after the bank settled that case, Donald Trump's election as president raised the prospect of faster economic growth and higher interest rates, a combination that brightened the prospects for many banks, but especially Bank of America given its large mortgage-securities portfolio.

The result is that Bank of America shares have soaredmore than 63% over the past year. That move is the biggest gain among the six big U.S. banks, four of which reported earnings this past week.

The last two, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., are slated to report resultsTuesday.

Wells Fargo posted the worst performance over the period, with a 20% gain.

Bank of America received an additional boost whenWarren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the largest shareholder at both lenders, discussed the banks in a late-August television interview.

He said both were ""terrific"" but that Wells Fargo likely had more troubles ahead. ""What you find is there's never just one cockroach in the kitchen,"" he said.

He has praised CEO Brian Moynihan's leadership and said he plans to be a Bank of America shareholder for a long time.

Bank of America's third-quarter profit rose because the bank continued to cut costs and got a lift in lending profits from higher interest rates. The results put the bank close to its long-held profitability goals.

Meanwhile, costs at Wells Fargo jumped 8%, to $14.35 billion, and Mr. Sloan said they are likely to remain heightened through year-end 2018. The bank also raised the target for its efficiency ratio because of lower-than-expected asset growth and higher-than-expected expenses.

The $1 billion litigation charge at Wells Fargo also cut into its community-banking unit results. This is one of the biggest parts of the bank."

A backdrop of improving global economic growth and the expectation that it will be another strong quarter for corporate earnings has supported stocks, traders say.

The march higher comes even as there have been some hiccups in data, from weaker-than-anticipated inflation to job losses in September, and as some investors worry shares look pricey.

""Good data is good, and bad data is now explained away because of the hurricanes,"" said R.J. Grant, director of equity trading at KBW Inc., adding that he believes the ""economy seems like it's humming along.""

The Nasdaq Composite rose 14.29 points, or 0.2%, to 6605.80, a fresh record. It added 0.2% in its third consecutive weekly gain.

Shares of financial companies in the S&P 500 declined for the third day in row. Major lenders started reporting their third-quarter earnings this past week, and while they have mostly beat expectations, their stocks dropped after the results.

Wells Fargo slid $1.52, or 2.8%, to $53.69, as the bank reported weaker-than-expected third-quarter revenue, while shares of Bank of America added 38 cents, or 1.5%, to 25.83, after the bank said its quarterly profit had risen 13% from a year earlier.

Shares of J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup fell after reporting their earnings results on Thursday.

A drop in U.S. government-bond yields also weighed on banks Friday, after data from the Labor Department showed U.S. core inflation rose less than expected.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged down to 2.280% from 2.323% Thursday.

The S&P 500 financials sector fell less than 0.1% Friday, notching a weekly drop of 0.9%. However, the sector remains up more than 5% over the past month, and it hasn't posted a negative October since 2009.

Shares of health-care companies came under pressure Friday following the Trump administration's decision to end billions of dollars in payments to insurers under the Affordable Care Act.

Health-care companies in the S&P 500 fell 0.3%, ending the week down 0.7%.

Wal-Mart Stores rose 52 cents, or 0.6%, to 86.62, bringing its weekly gain to 9.6%, its best week since 2003. The retailer said Tuesday that it would deepen its cost-cutting efforts and focus on existing stores and e-commerce.

Stocks around the world rose during the week, as money flowed into global stock funds. The Stoxx Europe 600 edged up 0.3%, putting its weekly rise at 0.5%.

Ctit Group,Big Banks' Card Woes Spell Trouble for Smaller Lenders," Oct 13, 2017",0,"J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup reported solid earnings Thursday, but also flashed a warning signal on consumer debt that investors in some other companies should heed.

The two banks beat analyst expectations for both revenue and profit growth in the third quarter.

Trading activity was weak, as expected, with fixed-income trading revenue declining 27% from a year earlier at J.P. Morgan and 16% at Citigroup. But this was more than offset by other areas of strength, including commercial lending growth at J.P. Morgan and international consumer banking at Citigroup.

Nevertheless, there was one area that deserves greater investor scrutiny, the continued deterioration in both banks' U.S. credit-card portfolios. This is more of an issue for Citigroup, because its card business tilts more toward somewhat less prime borrowers.

At J.P. Morgan, card charge-offs rose to 2.87% of total loans from 2.51% a year earlier. The bank stressed that this increase is well within its expectations.

Citigroup, however, says losses are increasing slightly faster than it had expected. Cards carrying its brand, which generally target less-risky borrowers, saw net charge-offs rise to 2.84% of total loans from 2.25% a year earlier. For its store-branded private-label cards, though, the ratio jumped to 4.7% from 3.9%. For next year, Citigroup expects charge-off rates of about 2.95% for its branded cards and 5% for its private-label cards.

These levels of losses are easily manageable for megabanks like Citigroup and J.P. Morgan, but the fact that they are worse than anticipated at Citigroup is still worrisome for other lenders who focus more narrowly on credit-card lending. It is a reminder that companies have limited visibility into how loans will perform after consumers have loaded up on credit card, auto and student debt in recent years.

Companies for investors to keep a wary eye on include Capital One Financial, Synchrony Financial and Alliance Data Systems. All three service less creditworthy borrowers, and the latter two focus on private-label cards similar to Citigroup's. Shares of these three consumer lenders all fell by more than 2% Thursday, while Citigroup dropped 3.4%.

Worries over credit defaults have dogged the consumer lenders for some time, driving weak share-price performance for all three this year. The numbers reported by their bigger rivals on Thursday suggest these worries are unlikely to fade soon."
Ctit Group,"Card Lending, Cost Cuts Fortify Banks --- Results at J.P. Morgan and Citigroup point to worsening quality of consumer credit"," Oct 13, 2017",1,"Growth in credit-card lending and a tight rein on costs boosted third-quarter profits at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., offsetting downbeat trading results and a still-challenging interest-rate environment.

The results, though, pointed to early signs of a potential deterioration in consumer-credit quality, which could be a concern for many lenders and credit-card issuers.

The results from J.P. Morgan and Citigroup, the Nos. 1 and 4 U.S. banks by assets, respectively, showed modest increases in revenue. But the focus on costs led net income to rise 7.1% at J.P. Morgan to $6.73 billion and 7.6% to $4.13 billion at Citigroup.

""We tightly managed our expenses and again saw loan and deposit growth in both our consumer and institutional businesses,"" Citigroup Chief Executive Michael Corbat told analysts Thursday.

Citigroup's efficiency ratio, or expenses as a percentage of revenue, improved to 56% for the quarter, better than the bank's target of 58% for the year. J.P. Morgan's fell to 55% from 57% a year earlier.

Both firms managed to beat Wall Street expectations for both revenue and earnings per share. Their stocks fell, though, as the results gave investors few reasons to think shares could build markedly on heady gains experienced in the wake of last year's presidential election.

Since Donald Trump's victory, Citigroup's stock has advanced by nearly 50% and J.P. Morgan shares are up nearly 40%. Both have outpaced the broader stock market and the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index.

Those gains reflected investor expectations for stronger economic growth, higher interest rates and looser regulations. But many of those hopes, such as for tax overhaul that would boost banks' profits, have yet to materialize.

J.P. Morgan shareholder Jason Ware, chief investment officer of Salt Lake City-based Albion Financial Group, said the banks' results were ""solid but perhaps not exceptional"" and largely in line with expectations.

On the all-important interest-rate front, the experience so far this year has been mixed. Rates have moved higher as the Federal Reserve has increased its short-term benchmark, but longer-term yields haven't risen as much.

That puts pressure on banks' net-interest margins, or the difference in what they earn by borrowing and lending money. These margins declined at Citigroup from a year ago, while they rose slightly at J.P. Morgan. At both banks, though, the margins remain historically low.

While net income grew at both banks, return on equity, a key measure of profitability, remained relatively subdued. J.P. Morgan's return for the third quarter was 11%. That is above the bank's theoretical cost of capital of 10%, but not by much.

Citigroup, meanwhile, posted a return of 7.3%. Although this is up from 6.8% in the prior quarter and a year earlier, it is still well below the 10% level. Citigroup for years hasn't posted a return that consistently cleared that hurdle.

The banks also had to combat a decline in trading revenue in the third quarter, as financial-market volatility remains at historically low levels. J.P. Morgan's trading revenue dropped 21% to $4.53 billion, hurt by a 27% falloff in fixed-income trading. Citigroup's trading desk didn't suffer as sharp a decline, but trading was still down 11% from a year ago to $3.63 billion.

J.P. Morgan finance chief Marianne Lake said during a call with analysts that the bank expects sluggish trading activity to continue into the fourth quarter and there were ""no obvious catalysts on the horizon.""

Both banks found bright spots with consumers.

Citigroup said it saw a 12% rise in revenue in its core North American retail-banking unit, to $1.2 billion, in part as more customers used its wealth-management services. It also saw a 6% jump in credit-card lending globally.

""We would rate the health of the consumer right now as pretty good,"" Mr. Corbat said. ""The combination of jobs, a little bit of wage growth, stable housing and rising asset prices has left the consumer in a pretty good place.""

J.P. Morgan also saw growth in its consumer unit, including an 8% rise in U.S. interest-bearing deposits. Ms. Lake said revenue in its credit-card business is expected to grow.

However, there are early signs that credit quality is slipping. Consumer payback rates have been a concern for lenders across the board, even as the U.S. labor market remains robust.

Citigroup set aside $2.15 billion in the third quarter to cover loans that could turn bad in the future, about $400 million more than a year ago. Much of that uptick in provisions was for credit-card loans. The bank said that future charge-offs were increasing more quickly than anticipated, though not to alarming levels. Its forecast went from a 2.85% loss rate for the year to 2.95% next year for Citigroup-branded cards.

""That's a little bit higher than what we had previously considered,"" Citigroup finance chief John Gerspach told analysts.

Meanwhile, charge-offs for so-called store cards rose to 4.7% in third quarter from 3.9% a year earlier.

J.P. Morgan set aside $1.46 billion in reserves in the third quarter, up from $1.13 billion a year earlier.

At Citigroup, there was another cause for concern. Revenue from branded cards, which Citigroup markets directly to consumers, declined 1% from a year ago.

The bank previously had suggested the second half of 2017 would deliver growth after years of investments -- such as paying to take on the card business of Costco Wholesale Corp. -- bore fruit.

""As late as June, we believed that . . . we'd be able to deliver at least some level of year-over-year revenue growth,"" Mr. Gerspach said. He added the bank was seeing tough competition in cards, where rivals have been offering increasingly generous inducements.

Mr. Gerspach said he still expected the bank's newest products, such as the Costco cards, to eventually deliver healthy growth."
Ctit Group,IMF Identifies 9 Vulnerable Big Banks," Oct 12, 2017",0,"The International Monetary Fund said some of the world's largest financial institutions -- including Deutsche Bank AG, Citigroup Inc., Barclays PLC and a few Japanese institutions -- could struggle in coming years to remain sufficiently profitable.

""About a third of banks by assets may struggle to achieve sustainable profitability, underscoring ongoing challenges and medium-term vulnerabilities,"" the IMF said, referring to the world's most important financial institutions.

The IMF's critique of the banks came in its semiannual Global Financial Stability Report, released Wednesday as finance ministers and central bankers from 189 countries gather in Washington for the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank.

It is unusual for a body like the IMF to identify banks by name. The report named nine financial institutions in all, Besides Citigroup, Deutsche and Barclays, it also named Societe Generale, Italy's UniCredit SpA, the U.K.'s Standard Chartered PLC and Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Mizuho Financial Group and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group as likely to deliver subpar profits.

All nine declined to comment on the report.

""Institutions that are not profitable might not be able to generate enough capital in the future should adverse shocks hit,"" Tobias Adrian, director of the IMF's monetary and capital markets department, told reporters. ""It might become a financial stability risk not to be profitable.""

The IMF said the consensus among private-sector bank-industry analysts was for a return on equity of less than 8% for each of those nine banks in 2019. In previous research, the IMF has said that banks' cost of equity -- that is the return stock investors expect on their holdings -- is at least 8%. Banks need to earn above this threshold to remain consistently profitable and otherwise may face difficulty building capital for a rainy day, the IMF said.

Regulators and international policy makers are typically circumspect about questioning the profitability of specific banks, often preferring to speak more generally out of concern they could weaken institutions that are already vulnerable and risk destabilizing the global financial system.

Some of the IMF's views are already conventional thinking on Wall Street. Deutsche Bank's stock, for example, trades at less than half of its book value, or net worth, and has traded well below this level since 2010. This suggests investors don't believe it will deliver returns that create value in the long run.

Citigroup investors have grown more confident in the bank's outlook. Over the past year, the shares have risen more than 50%, almost three times the gains of the broader market. The stock also is trading near its book value, or net worth; it last hit that level in September 2008. In June, the Federal Reserve allowed Citigroup to return nearly $19 billion in capital to investors through higher dividends and increased share buybacks.

Barclays and Standard Chartered, have been shedding asset and business lines to become more profitable. UniCredit, over the past year, took a number of actions to shore up its finances and improve profitability, including raising 13 billion euros ($15.3 billion) in fresh equity, selling a multibillion portfolio of bad loans and cutting costs."
Ctit Group,Expected Loan Growth Fails to Occur," Oct 11, 2017",1,"Since President Donald Trump's election, bankers and investors predicted that pro-business policies would lead to a surge in corporate borrowing, which would help bank profits.

Instead, the growth of loans to companies has dropped precipitously since last November -- to 2.1% from 8.1%, according to Federal Reserve data.

""Everybody thought we were about to catch a wave earlier in the year,"" said David Turner, chief financial officer of Regions Financial Corp., at a conference last month. ""It didn't happen.""

Companies have grown more reluctant to borrow after an initial surge of optimism following the election, said Jeff Glenzer, vice president at the Association for Financial Professionals, a group for corporate finance and treasury professionals. ""All the turmoil and the inability to move policy through Washington set in,"" he said.

But analysts say the long slowdown in commercial-loan growth may simply be a function of the metric returning to its normal level in recent decades. Growth in the category ran far above gross-domestic-product growth in the years following the financial crisis, a streak that is difficult to maintain for any prolonged period.

The loan-growth metric will be front and center in banks' third-quarter earnings reports, which start Thursday with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc.

The expected continuation of solid loan growth helped push bank stocks higher over about the past year. The degree to which bank investors need to rethink that premise may affect whether the stocks continue to outperform.

Lending profits at the banks largely depend on the dynamic between loan growth and interest rates. While recent increases in short-term rates have made floating-rate commercial loans more lucrative, the benefit has been limited by banks not making many more loans.

Loan growth ""has fallen short of postelection expectations,"" a federal advisory council of bank executives said at a September meeting, according to recently released minutes. Part of the reason loan growth has remained sluggish: a limited appetite from borrowers.

The drop in commercial-lending growth has weighed on broader annual loan growth at banks, which stands at 3.2%, down from 7.3% last November.

Bankers have been predicting for months that growth would pick up. BB&T Corp. CEO Kelly King said late last year that there was ""a huge pent-up demand"" from commercial clients that wanted to invest in their businesses after years of holding off. ""They're driving trucks with 250,000, 300,000 miles,"" Mr. King said.

But other industry observers say the lower growth rates are likely here to stay. Even some banks are getting less optimistic -- at least in the short term. ""This may just be the new normal,"" said Credit Suisse Group AG banking analyst Susan Roth Katzke.

Analysts have trimmed earnings expectations for banks including BB&T and U.S. Bancorp since the banks signaled last month that loan growth has been softer than expected.

BB&T, for example, said in July that it expected overall loans to be up 1% to 3% in the third quarter compared with the second quarter. In mid-September, the bank walked that back, saying it expected loan growth to be slightly down in that period.

BB&T executives are hopeful of a ramp-up in business borrowing in the longer run, in particular if a U.S. tax overhaul happens. Small and medium-size businesses, Mr. King said, are still ""much more confident, much more optimistic."""
Ctit Group,What Could Dash Hopes of Bank Investors," Oct 11, 2017",1,"The third quarter was pretty dull for American banks, which is not so bad considering what was happening a decade ago. Maybe investors like boring, because they gave bank shares a nice boost at the end of the quarter.

The rally won't last long if banks don't show good numbers on loan growth and consumer credit when they report earnings starting on Thursday.

J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup lead off the parade, and analysts have penciled in earnings-per-share increases of 5.1% and 5.6% from a year earlier for the two banks, respectively, according to FactSet.

Banks enjoyed the benefit of a June rate increase by the Federal Reserve during the quarter. But total loans and leases extended by U.S. commercial banks were up just 3.3% at the end of September from a year earlier, compared with 6.2% growth at the end of last year, according to Fed data.

And yet the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index has risen 11% over the past month on optimism about the global economy and rising expectations of a Fed rate increase. Markets are now pricing in a nearly 90% probability that the Fed will raise rates again in December, according to CME Group.

Bankers may talk about global growth and rate increases on their earnings calls, but it is doubtful they'll have any great insights. What the bankers do know is where two key indicators are heading: loan growth and credit quality.

One bright spot in the lending data is that commercial and industrial loans, which had been almost totally dormant, have picked up slightly. On a sequential basis, they rose 1.4% from the previous quarter, up from 0.8% growth in the second quarter. Bank executives can help investors get a read on whether corporate borrowers are getting comfortable again despite political uncertainty, perhaps encouraged by solid economic trends.

They can also shed light on the financial health of American consumers, who lately have been falling a bit behind on their credit-card and auto loans. This is less of a risk for the top banks than for smaller, consumer-focused lenders like Capital One Financial and Synchrony Financial. But the huge credit-card portfolios of banks like Citigroup bear watching.

This may have been a forgettable quarter for banks, but it is important for the industry's future. Lending growth will have to rebound, and consumer credit losses stabilize, for the recent bank rally to have staying power. If not, the fourth quarter will really be one to forget."
Ctit Group,"Ten Years After S&amp;amp;P 500's Precrisis Peak --- While major indexes are again setting records, some market sectors haven't fully recovered"," Oct 10, 2017",1,"By the summer of 2007, U.S. investment banks and the Federal Reserve were struggling to contain the fallout from the mortgage meltdown, but many investors were still betting a crisis would be averted. The S&P 500 closed at a record on Oct. 9, 2007. It would be its last until March 2013.

That Oct. 16, Citigroup Inc. reported a 57% drop in profit after it had to write down bets on mortgage-backed securities and loans to fund deals -- showing how deeply the summer's credit crisis hit its business and driving up anxiety over its future.

Merrill Lynch & Co. posted a $2.24 billion loss for the quarter on Oct. 25, as it took a $8.4 billion hit from revaluing bonds backed by mortgages and other write-downs. Merrill Chief Executive Stan O'Neal resigned shortly thereafter. Countrywide Financial Corp. posted its first quarterly loss in 25 years on roughly $1 billion in write-downs late that month. Both Merrill and Countrywide would eventually be bought by Bank of America Corp.

In the months that followed October 2007, stock indexes plunged, the U.S. economy fell into recession and central banks around the world began providing an unprecedented amount of monetary stimulus to stave off a deepening financial crisis.

Although major indexes are now back at record highs, thanks to a combination of a brightening global outlook, solid earnings growth and still-accommodative monetary policy, some areas of the U.S. stock market have yet to fully recover from the losses they sustained a decade ago."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Eurex to Share Profits to Lure Banks From U.K.," Oct 10, 2017",1,"German clearinghouse Eurex said Monday it is setting up a profit-sharing system with some of the world's biggest investment banks, in an unusual attempt to claw business away from the City of London ahead of Brexit.

Eurex Clearing will hand a portion of the profits from its interest-rates swap-clearing business back to banks in an effort to steal market share from its much larger U.K. competitor, LCH Group Ltd.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley are among the clients that have registered interest in participating in the program, Eurex said. The details of how the profits will be shared have yet to be made public.

The move comes as the battle to wrestle clearing from the U.K. after Britain leaves the European Union heats up. A clearinghouse sits between the buyers and sellers of instruments such as commodities and derivatives, pledging to complete the deal even if one side reneges.

London houses much of this financial plumbing that manages trillions of dollars of derivatives contracts every day. Britain clears more euro-denominated interest-rate derivatives than other EU countries combined -- about three-quarters of the EU total.

European officials worry that a key piece of financial infrastructure could be outside the EU once the U.K. leaves the trading block. In June, the EU's executive arm proposed plans that could force clearinghouses that do a chunk of business in euros to move into the EU. In a draft law, the European Commission also said that large clearinghouses operating outside the EU would be subject to tougher oversight including on-site inspections and access to financial accounts.

The International Swaps and Derivatives Association warned that this policy presented ""serious concerns."" ISDA said forcing parts of the clearing business to migrate to Europe would fragment markets and create instability. Banks have warned that splitting off a piece of the clearing market to a new venue could increase the amount of capital they have to hold against those trades."
Ctit Group,"Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Citi, BofA Shares Still Recovering"," Oct 10, 2017",0,"How far are Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. from a post-financial-crisis recovery?

It depends on the metric you look at. By measuring the two megabanks' market capitalizations, they have climbed a long way back. Bank of America, which made some big acquisitions during the crisis, traded above its precrisis peak this month. Citigroup, with a total market value of about $205 billion, is about 25% off its 2007 peak.

But stockholders aren't feeling that flush. In fact, their experience tells a much different story. Shares of Bank of America are down 51% from early 2007 and those of Citigroup are down 86%.

Blame it on the cruel math of share dilution.

The poor performance of Citi and Bank of America is one legacy of their huge share sales after the financial crisis. The U.S. government took stakes in the largest U.S. financial institutions in late 2008 and early 2009 in an effort to stem the spiraling financial crisis through its Troubled Asset Relief Program. All six of the biggest U.S. banks received bailouts, but Citi and Bank of America, which each got $45 billion in two increments, were by far the biggest beneficiaries.

As banks looked to escape federal ownership at the end of 2009, they sold shares to raise capital from the public markets. Citi and Bank of America were among the biggest issuers of their own shares. By one measure, banks accounted for half of stock sales by already-public companies in 2009.

Bank of America's shares outstanding more than doubled to 10.1 billion between the end of 2007 and the end of 2010, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Citi's shares climbed almost sixfold over that span. By contrast, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s share count climbed only about 17% and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s increased about 27% over that stretch.

At the time, the share sales served as one sign that struggling banks could once again raise capital from private investors. But selling more shares also tends to dilute their value, holding down stock prices despite the value of the business remaining unchanged. That made it harder for the shares to climb out of the wreckage of the financial crisis, even as the value of the companies began growing again. Even now, Bank of America and Citigroup continue to lag behind their peers."
Ctit Group,Subprime Lender OneMain Is for Sale," Oct 9, 2017",0,"Subprime lender OneMain Financial Holdings Inc. is in talks to sell itself, according to people familiar with the matter.

OneMain is in advanced discussions with a number of interested parties, both rival lenders and private-equity firms, the people said. The value of the bids couldn't be learned, but given OneMain's market value of $3.9 billion and adding a takeover premium, a deal could be worth around $4 billion or more.

There is no guarantee the auction will produce a deal, however. If it does, it would be one of the biggest financial-industry transactions at a time when the bank mergers-and-acquisitions sector is relatively muted.

A postcrisis castoff from Citigroup Inc., OneMain makes car and other personal loans, mostly to people who have trouble borrowing elsewhere. Three-quarters of its $14 billion portfolio is loans to people with credit scores under 660 -- the bottom third of U.S. borrowers, according to Fair Isaac Corp., or FICO, data.

With some 1,700 branches nationwide and 2.2 million customers, it is one of the largest players in the nation's shadow-banking system, a network of nonbank firms that has advanced against more heavily regulated counterparts following the financial crisis. Big banks have pulled back from making riskier loans, the raw material for the noxious securities whose failures fueled the 2008 meltdown.

Citigroup sold OneMain in 2015 to Springleaf, a rival lender backed by Fortress Investment Group Inc., the large alternative-asset manager.

Fortress today owns about 55% of OneMain's shares. The rest trade publicly and closed Friday at $28.88, giving the firm a market capitalization of about $3.9 billion.

There has been relatively little deal making among nationwide lenders since the financial crisis. Large banks that might be natural fits to acquire niche loan businesses are often restricted by regulators from doing deals that would make them much bigger.

Meanwhile, Silicon Valley online upstarts such as LendingClub Corp. and Social Finance Inc. have skimmed higher-quality borrowers from the pool and the postmerger run for OneMain has been rocky. Its shares have fallen from a peak of $53 in 2015, and the company cut guidance last year after a slowdown in loan growth and an uptick in delinquencies.

OneMain has been reducing debt and pivoting toward loans that are backed by cars and other collateral, which are less risky than unsecured loans. About half of its $3 billion in loans issued last quarter had collateral.

That has helped make it one of the best-performing specialty-finance stocks this year, up 30% and outpacing peers such as Santander Consumer USA Inc., the subprime auto-loan subsidiary of the Spanish banking giant, and Synchrony Financial, the big retail credit-card issuer.

But threats still loom. For one, the customer set is shrinking. An improving economy, lower unemployment, and the falling away of old bankruptcies and foreclosures from thousands of credit histories have cut the share of U.S. adults with subprime credit scores to postcrisis lows.

Fortress is in the process of being sold to SoftBank Group Corp. and has been shedding assets."

Ctit Group,"Management: Boards Wake Up to Company Culture --- Whirlpool, Citigroup and CACI International boost oversight of their business environments"," Oct 4, 2017",1,"Corporate culture counts. But bad culture can damage a company's reputation, results and recruitment.

That's why boards are starting to scrutinize the cultures of companies they serve. Directors at Whirlpool Corp., for example, make sure its workers feel comfortable divulging bad news by tracking internal surveys. Companies such as Citigroup Inc. and CACI International Inc. have formed board culture committees.

Culture describes the way values and actions create a unique business environment. One recent study found that a positive corporate culture improves company profits.

Yet ""few boards currently have an explicit focus or formalized approach to cultural oversight,"" said Helene Gayle, a director of Coca-Cola Co. and Colgate-Palmolive Co.

A blue-ribbon panel co-led by Ms. Gayle wants boards to monitor corporate culture as vigilantly as they do risks. The 34-member commission, organized by the National Association of Corporate Directors, intends to release an extensive report on Wednesday that suggests how boards could bolster their oversight of company culture.

The panel's 10 recommended steps include regular measurements of corporate culture, using a combination of factors such as chief executives' performance reviews and the scope of power held by risk-management officers. The panel also suggests crackdowns on incentive-pay plans that might weaken culture.

""Oversight of corporate culture should be among the top governance imperatives for every board,"" the panel of independent directors, recruiters and consultants concluded. A strong culture offers ""a powerful source of competitive advantage,"" while companies with weak cultures see far higher levels of misconduct, the report said.

Recent crises at Uber Technologies Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. were partly blamed on culture flaws.

Uber is grappling with scandals, government probes and shareholder litigation. CEO Travis Kalanick quit under investor pressure in June. The ride-hailing company declined to comment on a shareholder suit filed in late September that called its corporate culture ""a toxic hotbed,"" threatening its business.

Wells Fargo admitted culture problems following a sales-practices scandal that erupted a year ago. The bank said employees opened customer accounts using fictitious or unauthorized information to meet lofty sales goals. The revelation led then-CEO John Stumpf to retire abruptly.

His successor, Timothy Sloan, this spring said the bank would conduct a companywide survey so leaders can ""foster an ethical, inclusive, and customer-focused culture.""

Whirlpool directors make sure management at the appliance giant maintains a strong culture through annual employee polls, executive performance evaluations, analysis of whistleblower-hotline calls and risk assessments of pay practices, according to Mike White, the board audit committee's chairman.

Board members intensified their cultural oversight after Whirlpool became a target of a U.S. government antitrust investigation into the global compressor industry. As a result of the probe, the company's compressor business based in Brazil agreed in 2010 to plead guilty to price fixing of refrigerant compressors and pay a $91.8 million fine.

""A couple of individuals made bad decisions,"" said Jeff Fettig, Whirlpool's longtime CEO who stepped down on Sunday. He remains chairman.

In response, Mr. Fettig said he revamped compliance training, replaced a division head and renewed Whirlpool's commitment to encouraging employees to speak up about misdeeds.

The board also gave Mr. Fettig tougher marching orders, with a 2010 performance goal to ""make sure it doesn't happen again,"" Mr. White said. The board would later trim Mr. Fettig's 2011 bonus.

Mr. Fettig said in hindsight, the episode was ""very positive for our culture."" For instance, he said, worker survey scores about their willingness to speak up rose 10 percentage points between 2010 and 2015.

Citigroup takes a different approach. In 2014, it became the first large U.S. bank to create a board ethics and culture committee, recalled panel chairman Franz Humer.

A management ""culture audit"" commissioned by the committee uncovered varying views about valued behaviors, including how Citigroup defines performance, Mr. Humer said.

Panel members encouraged senior executives to create a common approach from the top, he added.

Among other things, Mr. Humer said, these directors reviewed CEO Michael Corbat's culture presentation before his next gathering of the bank's top 250 executives.

And during a strategy session this summer, the full board agreed that management should sharpen Citigroup's cultural focus by supporting tougher performance evaluations, Mr. Humer said.

Directors want bosses to judge their subordinates on ""how we achieve results, not just the results achieved."""
Ctit Group,Renovate America Founder Exits," Oct 4, 2017",1,"Renovate America Inc., the largest lender of energy-saving home-improvement loans, announced a companywide shake-up Tuesday, including the departure of one of its co-founders and the demotion of another from chief executive to a strategy role.

The company also said it has hired law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom to undertake a third-party review of the company. The moves come a week after The Wall Street Journal reported that investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Securities and Exchange Commission were looking into the company's businesses practices.

San Diego-based Renovate America is the largest private lender in the Property Assessed Clean Energy, or PACE, program, which helps homeowners purchase solar panels and other energy-efficient appliances. Renovate America is backed by large venture-capital and private-equity firms.

Renovate America said in a statement that chief executive JP McNeill, who co-founded the company in 2008 with Nick Fergis, would move into a long-term strategy role and become vice chairman of the company's board. Mr. Fergis, who served as chief operating officer, will leave the company.

Mr. McNeill's role will be filled by Roy Guthrie, whom Renovate America called a ""40-year financial services industry leader.""Mr. Guthrie previously served as chief financial officer of Discover Financial Services Inc. and held executive roles at Citigroup Inc.

Renovate said Mr. Fergis's role will be filled by Patrick Moore, the company's current chief lending officer. A company spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the statement.

The fast-growing PACE program has been beset by controversy as homeowners have complained that they didn't understand their loan terms and can't afford their debt, the Journal has reported. The average PACE loan is $25,000 and is added to a homeowners' property bill along with their property taxes. Loans have been bundled into bond deals and sold to asset managers and investors.

The Journal reported last week that the FBI is seeking documents that show how Renovate America marketed its financing to homeowners, trained its sales force and outside contractors who broker loans, and communicated with investors. The SEC's investigation appears to focus on payments made to struggling homeowners that weren't disclosed to investors, the Journal reported.

Renovate America has said that it has been assured that it isn't the target of an FBI investigation and that it believes the target of that agency's investigation is a contractor with which the company has done business. It said it has received an information request from the SEC and is cooperating.

An SEC spokesman has declined to comment, and an FBI spokeswoman has said the agency wouldn't confirm or deny the existence of an investigation to an individual or company.

In its announcement Tuesday, Renovate said it had retained Skadden Arps and consultant Navigant to ""conduct and make public a third-party review of practices and procedures, taking stock of where the company can improve on where it's been and where it's going as it transitions to the new, regulated marketplace for PACE."""
Ctit Group,Markets Review &amp;amp; Outlook: Third Quarter: Rates Drive Bank Stocks --- S&amp;amp;P financials end period at highest level since crisis but still trail broader market," Oct 2, 2017",1,"Interest rates whipsawed bank stocks in the third quarter and are likely to be the dominant force for shares through the end of the year, despite investor optimism around a tax-code overhaul.

The S&P financials closed the quarter at a post-financial-crisis high, bringing their year-to-date rise to about 11%. But that fell short of the S&P 500's gain of 12.5%.

The performance reflected that banks stocks, after surging in the wake of last November's election, have struggled at times this year to maintain their momentum.

In late August and early September, for example, bank stocks tumbled. That mirrored a drop in the yield of the 10-year Treasury, which fell to 2.04% from 2.39% in July, amid mounting hurricane concerns and rising geopolitical tensions.

As hurricane damage proved to be less than the most dire projections, the yield reversed course and climbed to 2.33% by the end of the month. Bank stocks rose along with it.

After dropping about 5% between early August and early September, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. bounced back by nearly 8%. The bank, the biggest in the U.S. by assets and market value, ended the quarter at a record close of $95.51 a share.

The Trump administration's unveiling of a tax-overhaul plan near the end of September gave bank stocks an added fillip.

The tax ""proposal is a tailwind for the sector,"" said Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investment Group, a New York-based asset manager with $3 billion under advisement. ""The banking sector depends on economic growth, and to the extent we get tax reform that flows through to better growth, that supports the stocks.""

Clarity on tax policy could also spur merger activity. ""So we could see a pickup in activity that would support the advisory business of the banks,"" Mr. Benowitz added.

Still, bank stocks remain tethered to interest rates; lending and trading conditions might also prove short-term drags on their performance.

Some analysts have ratcheted back their expectations for banks' growth over the rest of the year. Nomura Instinet said last week that it lowered its third-quarter forecasts for big banks.

Executives at the biggest firms have already signaled that trading revenue for the third quarter is likely to decline from 15% to 20% versus a year earlier.

And Federal Reserve loan data also point toward softening loan growth, particularly in U.S. banks' commercial and industrial lending, which was down 0.1% from the beginning of the quarter through Sept. 20, according to analysts at Jefferies. Several analysts also noted possible declines due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

Analysts also aren't yet giving any credit for the tax proposal, even if it holds the promise of quickly boosting banks' bottom lines.

""Some difficult special interest battles are ahead, suggesting Congress's true timeline for passage is longer than their currently stated goal of passage by year-end,"" wrote analysts at Morgan Stanley in a note last week.

The result is that banks may be even more dependent on what is happening with interest rates. On that front, bankers expect further, gradual rises, rather than any abrupt upward lurch that could disrupt markets.

""Any sort of planning starts with the environment and. . .the key word is measured,"" said Citigroup Inc. Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach, speaking to analysts in September. ""It's not that we're talking about crazy increases in interest rates.""

Yet plans by the Federal Reserve to begin whittling down its balance sheet have cast uncertainty over how long-term yields will behave. More immediately, short-term yields have risen at a faster pace than long-term ones as the Fed has increased its benchmark rate.

That has led to a flattening of the yield curve, which can weigh on bank profits. Banks typically generate higher profits when there is a bigger difference between short-term rates, which more closely track how much it costs for banks to gather deposits, and long-term rates, which track how much banks earn when they lend out money to home buyers or corporations.

The difference, or spread, between yields on the two-year and 10-year Treasurys is one proxy for this. Wells Fargo & Co. Chief Executive Tim Sloan told analysts in September that the rate of the bank's growth in the second half of the year will depend in part on ""the level and slope of the yield curve.""

Unfortunately for banks, the spread remains low; it was under 1 percentage point throughout the third quarter, although it did tick up a bit toward the end of September."
Ctit Group,REVIEW --- Autumn Books: The Four Horsemen of Big Tech," Sep 30, 2017",1,"The Four

By Scott Galloway

Portfolio, 310 pages, $28

Tech is the business story of our time. Apple is the most valuable company based in the United States. Google's parent, Alphabet, is the second most valuable, and Facebook and Amazon are fourth and fifth, respectively.

But tech is not merely a business story. As more and more of life has become digital, the giants in tech have become a political story, too, wielding power that our regulatory apparatus, assembled in an earlier era, is ill-suited to oversee. In 2006, when the first, second, fourth and fifth places in the most-valuable list were occupied by ExxonMobil, GE, Citigroup and Bank of America, none of these companies' products or services had been used by a foreign power to disseminate misinformation in the preceding presidential election.

A spate of recent books -- including Jonathan Taplin's ""Move Fast and Break Things"" and Franklin Foer's ""World Without Mind,"" both published earlier this year -- have called attention to the dark side of tech's ascendancy. Scott Galloway's ""The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google"" sits apart.

Mr. Galloway is an experienced entrepreneur and a clinical professor of marketing at NYU's Stern School of Business. He is not unaware of the disturbing power of big tech and is concerned about the small number of employees that these companies need to achieve their outsize valuations. But he is mostly concerned with telling compact stories about how ""the Four Horsemen,"" as he calls them -- Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon -- became so successful. He emphasizes the way they have built their brands and the way we consumers are complicit in their acquiring unbounded power, having willingly invited them ""into the most intimate areas of our lives.""

In the book's introduction, Mr. Galloway makes much of the rapid increase in the market capitalization of the four companies, noting that their aggregate value rose in just four years -- from early 2013 to early 2017 -- by approximately $1.3 trillion, which is equivalent to the GDP of Russia.

If market cap is the starting point, however, it would make more sense to speak of ""the Five"" and include Microsoft. But at a conference in 2011, Eric Schmidt, then Google's chief executive, wrote Microsoft out of the picture by speaking of ""the Gang of Four."" Mr. Galloway accepts this number, omitting the fully paid-up member of big tech that just happens to be the third most valuable company in America. Microsoft's market cap has increased more than $250 billion in the past 3 1/2 years, thanks to a turnaround led by Satya Nadella, its CEO.

Amazon is the first company that Mr. Galloway profiles. He covers its shrewd storytelling, which has persuaded its shareholders to be eternally patient; its investment in offline stores, allowing it to provide multichannel distribution; and its nascent deployment of voice-ordering via Alexa, a service that may well move customers from rival-branded merchandise to Amazon-branded products. He also ticks off its accumulation of artificial-intelligence expertise; its build-out of warehouses that are within 20 miles of 45% of the U.S. population; and its acquisition of Whole Foods' 460 stores. At the time the book went to press, Amazon was America's fourth most valuable company (today it is fifth), but Mr. Galloway predicts that it will pass the others and become the first company to achieve a market capitalization of $1 trillion.

As Amazon continues to expand its scope, many industry sectors will be negatively affected. Mr. Galloway chooses the transitive verb ""molest"" to describe how Amazon will act on the retail ecosystem. This word choice brings out a problem that shows up early in the book: discordant language. Amazon's assets are described in one place with a term composed of a vulgar word for excrement and ""loads."" When Marc Lore, the founder of the e-commerce company Quidsi, left Amazon two years after joining it (as part of Amazon's $545 million acquisition of Quidsi), he turned around and started Jet.com. Of the move, Mr. Galloway writes: ""This must have felt like a half-a-billion-dollar divorce settlement to your husband, who then moves into the house next door and starts -- "" and here he uses a well-known slang verb for intercourse. What may be the perfectly piquant phrase for David Mamet on stage does not play so well on the printed page.

Less coarsely, Mr. Galloway puts his understanding of retail to good use in his treatment of Apple. He shows the brilliance of Steve Jobs's decision to vertically integrate the company in the form of stores, a decision that did not look brilliant at the time. Mr. Galloway calls our attention to the way Apple prepared for the move, recruiting to its board in 1999 -- two years before it opened its first store -- Mickey Drexler, the man who had made Gap Inc. the outstanding retail story of the 1980s. Having its own stores -- and thus the power to insert itself on Fifth Avenue and the Champs-Elysees among Vuitton, Cartier and Hermes -- established Apple as a luxury brand. The company's enviably high margins come from what Mr. Galloway describes as a unique combination: ""the premium-priced product, and the low-cost producer.""

The transformation of Apple into a luxury brand is a good story. But Mr. Galloway often mixes the insightful with the ridiculous, sketching a cartoonish version of evolutionary psychology: ""Since men are wired to procreate aggressively, the caveman in us hungers for that Rolex, or Lamborghini -- or Apple. And the caveman, thinking with his genitals, will sacrifice a lot (pay an irrational price) for the chance to impress."" There are many such references to hunter-gatherers and to genitals -- and one reference in particular, to Tiger Woods's, that is so offensive that upon reading it one rubs one's eyes in disbelief.

When Mr. Galloway takes up Alphabet, he is interested only in the Google division, but his ability to say much about Google, or Facebook, is limited by the absence of physical stores in their histories. ""The Four"" is limited in another way as well: It is based almost entirely on accounts written not by principals in the companies but by reporters. Near-complete reliance on secondary sources is forgivable, but misreading them is not.

Mr. Galloway refers to ""the most famous 'theft' in tech history,"" the visit that Steve Jobs made to Xerox's research lab in Palo Alto, Calif., in 1979. It was during this visit that Jobs saw a personal computer with a graphical interface, windows and mouse -- the essential things that, once glimpsed, supposedly made the Macintosh possible. But many other lab visitors saw these things, too. At the time, they were merely proofs-of-concept. Much invention and problem-solving had to follow to make the concepts into a commercial product.

The ""theft"" myth was debunked long ago. A full chapter was devoted to dismantling it in a book published in 1993: ""Steve Jobs and the NeXT Big Thing."" (I can recall this only because I am the book's author.) Mr. Galloway cites a more recent source to back up his ""theft"" claim, an article published in the New Yorker in 2011, but that article, in fact, is devoted to showing that the story is a myth. Five pages later, in the same context, he cites the article again.

When Mr. Galloway completes his survey of the Four Horseman, he throws in a chapter of career advice for young adults that is filled with bromides such as go to college, get to a city and promote your personal brand (or, as Mr. Galloway puts it, ""Pimp Your Career""). He urges readers to exercise regularly and stay fit: ""Walking into any conference room and feeling that . . . you could kill and eat the others gives you an edge and confidence (note: don't do this)."" The connection between this tidbit of advice and big tech is not made clear.

Mr. Galloway occasionally offers offhand remarks about similarities among the companies he discusses, but his separate accounts of each bring out doubts that they should be thought of as a cohesive group. There are the two behemoths in advertising, Google and Facebook, which are in direct competition with each other; there is the luxury-goods company, Apple; and there is the everything store of Amazon. The categories compete only along some edges. Referring to the Four Horsemen provides the frisson of the biblical prophecy, but it would be better to speak -- more accurately if not as apocalyptically -- of the Two and the One and the One.

Ctit Group,GoPro Launches New Devices as It Battles Smartphone," Sep 29, 2017",0,"GoPro Inc. is betting on two new devices to differentiate itself from the rapidly advancing camera technology found in smartphones, and to help it reclaim profitability.

At a product unveiling Thursday, the action-camera company announced the Hero 6 Black, a refreshed version of its flagship camera aimed at adventure seekers.

The Hero 6 Black is packed for the first time with a custom processor created specifically for GoPro. The company said the camera includes digital zoom, improved voice control, simpler editing software and the ability to transport footage at three times the speed than its predecessor. It sells for $499, about $100 more than its previous version.

The camera, though, also highlights the challenges GoPro faces as it competes for consumers who increasingly shoot their lives on the smartphones readily available in their pockets. For instance, the Hero 6 Black will be able to shoot in 4K at 60 frames a second, the same capabilities in Apple Inc.'s new iPhone 8. The camera also carries a price tag just shy of the entry price for some premium smartphones.

To differentiate itself, GoPro also announced Fusion, a long-awaited 360-degree spherical camera it has been teasing since last year.

While other 360-degree cameras have hit the market in recent years, GoPro is banking on features such as OverCapture, which will allow consumers to capture every angle at once and choose later which perspective they want to share via the GoPro app.

The Fusion is available for preorder for $699, with shipments starting in November. However, some of its distinct software tricks, such as OverCapture and filters that can manipulate footage's perspective, won't be available until next year.

The product launches come as GoPro is trying to rediscover its footing after a rough year that included supply-chain snafus, an embarrassing recall and layoffs. Sales had dropped by half.

GoPro is showing some signs it is headed in the right direction.

It logged a loss of $12.9 million in the second quarter, narrowing from $72.6 million a year earlier.

Earlier this month, the company said it expects third-quarter revenue to come in at the upper end of its prior guidance of between $290 million and $310 million.

Stanley Kovler, an analyst at Citigroup, estimates the new guidance implies roughly 35,000 to 40,000 in additional camera-unit sales.

GoPro Chief Executive Nick Woodman said Thursday's launch has been its smoothest yet. ""We know that we had challenges with that in the past,"" he told analysts on a conference call, ""and this year we got it right."""
Ctit Group,Tax Proposal Is Winner for Wall Street," Sep 29, 2017",1,"Wall Street has hungered for a tax overhaul, and with good reason. If it spurs stronger economic growth, corporate borrowing and finance firms' profits could jump.

A lower corporate tax rate as called for in the tax framework unveiled by the Trump administration Wednesday should immediately boost banks' own profits. Bankers expect some pain points but are confident the benefits will outweigh them.

Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman said at an industry conference in June that a 25% corporate tax rate would lift his bank's earnings by 15%, assuming no changes to the business mix. The Trump framework calls for a 20% rate, so the benefit could be even greater.

Citigroup Inc. has said that a cut to a 25% rate plus a tax holiday on foreign earnings would have boosted its annual net income by $800 million, or by about 5%. It also would improve the bank's return on equity by more than 1 percentage point, estimated John McDonald, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein.

Any fillip in economic growth could potentially help reverse a decline in business-loan growth experienced since late last year. Some bank executives have attributed this slowdown to clients waiting for a tax overhaul to be finalized before ramping up borrowing and investing in their businesses. A lack of clarity also has been cited as a slowing factor for deal making on companies' part.

Smaller banks could also reap bigger gains since they have relatively high effective tax rates and businesses that are almost purely domestic, Evercore ISI analysts said in a note. A potential tax cut to 28% from 35% could boost 2018 earnings for regional banks by a median of 9%, they said.

The Trump proposals also spare an important business for banks and other lenders: mortgages. The administration's document calls on Congress to retain the deduction for mortgage interest. A change to that could have disrupted housing markets.

While the framework would leave unchanged certain taxes on investments, including those on capital gains and dividends, the money-management industry also stands to benefit.

If a lower corporate tax rate lifts profits at many U.S. companies, this should add fuel to the stock-market rally and boost returns on equity funds. Smaller and midsize companies should make out particularly well because they tend to pay a higher tax rate than larger peers, said Joseph Amato, president of the $271 billion asset manager Neuberger Berman Group LLC.

Some money managers such as WisdomTree Investments Inc. would also benefit directly. In the latest quarter, it reported a 45.5% tax rate, largely due to overseas losses it couldn't deduct. Executives have said a lower rate would help it in that area as well as help support the company's dividend.

Not that there won't be some downsides.

Among them: A number of banks have what are called ""deferred tax assets."" These are created by losses, in many cases huge ones racked up during the financial crisis, and act as IOUs that can be used to offset future tax bills. Those will lose value.

Citigroup, for example, had $46 billion of the assets at the end of the second quarter. A reduction in the corporate tax rate to 20%, plus a shift to a territorial regime that taxes only income generated in the U.S., could reduce the assets' value by more than $15 billion, according to figures the bank has provided. Citigroup would have to take that charge as a one-time hit to profits.

Bank of America had $19.2 billion in net deferred-tax assets at the end of 2016. Only about $7 billion of these apply to the U.S. and so would be subject to revaluation. That would lead to a write-down of around $3 billion if the tax rate is lowered to 20%.

The benefit of lower rates, though, would likely make up for that within a year or so through higher profits, a person familiar with the matter said.

Another issue is a proposal to partially limit companies' ability to deduct net interest expense. The administration didn't define what partially limited means.

That is important: Bank executives have said that they hope this will mean that financial institutions are exempted. If not, their business model would be under threat.

Financial firms borrow huge amounts of money to lend out and invest. In that sense, money is their raw material. If banks couldn't deduct the interest expense, which is akin to nonfinancial companies' cost of goods sold, that would create a huge tax hit.

For bank clients, limiting the deductibility of net interest expense could make debt issuance less attractive. That, in turn, could crimp the business of helping companies raise and sell bonds and loans.

Debt-capital-markets businesses accounted for $10.4 billion in revenue at the dozen biggest global banks in the first half of 2017, or 13% of their total investment-banking and trading revenue, according to the industry data tracker Coalition.

That figure grew by 18% from a year earlier. And it was the only investment-banking business to have done better in 2016 than it did in 2015.

""Changing the deductibility of interest will have a profound impact on the foundations of corporate finance,"" said Reuben Daniels, managing partner at EA Markets LLC, which advises companies on capital raising.

For the private-equity industry, which relies heavily on debt financing, that change could translate into firms paying lower prices for assets.

That corporate interest is deductible, but dividend payments aren't, has skewed how companies fund their operations, creating a bias toward debt. In the 1980s, it enabled the rise of leveraged buyouts in which financiers borrowed heavily to buy companies, then wrote off the interest payments."
Ctit Group,Uber Exits U.S. Car Leasing as Losses Rise," Sep 28, 2017",1,"Uber Technologies Inc. said it is shutting down its U.S. auto-leasing business, months after it discovered it was losing 18 times more money per vehicle than previously thought.

The ride-hailing firm on Wednesday began informing employees of the decision to close down the business, known as Xchange Leasing, which will affect some 500 jobs, representing roughly 3% of Uber's 15,000-employee staff. It marks Uber's first mass layoff in its eight-year history.

""We have decided to stop operating Xchange Leasing and move towards a less capital-intensive approach,"" said a spokesman. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the decision to wind down the business last month.

The move suggests Uber was unable to find a buyer for the business, a prior hope of some executives.

Uber has been working to curtail costs after posting at least $4.4 billion in total losses over the past six quarters, particularly as its new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, considers an initial public stock offering in as little as 18 months. Earlier this year, Uber merged its money-losing Russian operations with its competitor there and last year sold its China unit.

Uber started the Xchange Leasing division about two years ago under former CEO

Travis Kalanick, investing about $600 million in the business, according to people familiar with the matter. The division was financed in part by a $1 billion credit facility from a consortium of banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley.

The idea was to sign up new drivers whose spotty or nonexistent credit histories prevented them from getting their own cars. But by charging high lease fees in exchange for the risk, many drivers worked longer hours and returned the vehicles in poor shape, damaging their resale value, people familiar with the matter have said.

In July, Uber executives discovered the unit was losing around $9,000 a vehicle, compared with previous estimates of $500, and decided to halt the business, according to these people.

Uber faces other problems. In London, where it is trying to negotiate with regulators over its operating license, it is also fighting a separate battle. On Wednesday, Uber argued in a London appeals tribunal that its U.K. drivers should be treated as independent contractors, not as workers, and therefore shouldn't be entitled to benefits such as minimum wages and paid vacations."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Brevan Howard To 'Seed' New Fund," Sep 20, 2017",1,"Brevan Howard Asset Management LLP, one of the world's biggest hedge-fund firms, plans to inject $300 million to $400 million into a new fund run by one of its star traders, according to two people familiar with the matter, as it battles to revive its fortunes.

Brevan's assets under management have tumbled from about $40 billion to $11.6 billion in recent years amid weak returns from its flagship fund. It is injecting the cash as ""seed"" money that will help the new fund, run by trader Alfredo Saitta, get up and running.

The investment is a significant one at a time when new hedge-fund launches often struggle to attract investors' interest.

Once, a new fund by a star trader could attract $1 billion or more.

Now, a fund that raises a few hundred million dollars is considered successful, with many failing to get off the ground or folding quickly after starting.

Brevan's billionaire co-founder Alan Howard, who recently moved back to London from Geneva, is personally investing in the fund, one of the people said.

The new fund for Mr. Saitta, a former trader at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., is set to be launched in coming months and will trade short-dated interest rates, as well as currencies and stocks, said one of the people.

Like many macro funds -- which trade bonds, currencies and other assets -- Brevan's main fund has struggled in recent years. Many managers have found it hard to predict asset prices because of stimulus measures from central banks.

Brevan's main fund lost money in two of the past three calendar years and is down 3.8% this year through August, according to a letter to investors reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Hedge funds overall are up 4.1% this year on average through Sept. 14, according to research firm HFR Inc.

Mr. Saitta has been running part of Brevan's main fund and has made annual returns in the double-digit percentages, said a person familiar with the matter."
Ctit Group,Finance Watch," Sep 19, 2017",1,"SWISS BANKING

Over $100,000 Is

Flushed Down Toilet

A recent report by UBS Group AG concluded that rich people were sitting on too much cash. Little did anyone know just how right they were.

Prosecutors in Geneva are trying to figure out why two women flushed roughly 100,000 euros ($119,000) in cut-up 500 euro bank notes down a toilet at a UBS branch in the Swiss city as well as down toilets at three neighboring restaurants back in May.

Local authorities were alerted because of damage done to the toilets and plumbing, said Vincent Derouand, spokesman for the Geneva prosecutor's office. Using video surveillance, investigators were able to identify two women who they say stuffed the notes down the toilets.

Later, an attorney representing the women approached the restaurants to pay for the repairs, which amounted to several thousand francs.

The story was earlier reported last week by the Geneva daily Tribune de Geneve. A UBS spokesman declined to comment.

It isn't a crime in Switzerland to destroy currency. But the prosecutor's office is still investigating to see whether the flushed cash resulted from criminal activities.

Adding to the intrigue, euros aren't even used in Switzerland, which isn't in the eurozone and still has the Swiss franc.

The European Central Bank will stop issuing 500 euro notes at the end of next year, though existing ones will remain legal tender.

CREDIT SUISSE

Investment Bank

Undergoes Revamp

Credit Suisse Group AG unveiled a raft of changes to the upper ranks of its investment bank, bringing in new co-heads for Europe, the Middle East and Africa as the Swiss banking giant revamps the division amid a broader strategic overhaul.

Mathew Cestar and Jens Welter, both Credit Suisse veterans, have been appointed co-heads of investment banking and capital markets for the region.

They succeed Marisa Drew and Mark Echlin, who have moved to other positions within the bank.

Monday's management shuffle comes as the Swiss bank undertakes a broad strategic shift to put greater emphasis on its more predictable wealth-management operations while scaling back investment banking, which can be highly profitable but also volatile.

While investment banking has recently proved to be attractive for Credit Suisse, with revenue and profit up sharply in the first half of 2017, the bank lags behind its U.S. rivals.

Credit Suisse ranked ninth in the first half of this year measured by investment-banking revenue for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, according to Dealogic.

The top four positions are dominated by U.S.-based banks. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. holds the top position followed by Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp.'s Merrill Lynch. Deutsche Bank AG is fifth.

To bolster its franchise, Credit Suisse has turned to Messrs. Cestar and Welter, who, in addition to their new responsibilities, will retain their positions as chairman of the global credit products commitment committee and co-head of global consumer products and retail investment banking, respectively.

Mr. Cestar recently worked on the financing for Bain Capital's $3.2 billion acquisition of the Diversey unit of Sealed Air Corp. and the financing of CVC Capital Partners' acquisition of Grupo Cortefiel, a Spanish retailer.

Mr. Welter, meanwhile, advised McCormick & Co. on its $4.2 billion deal this summer to acquire Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC's food division. He also worked on the merger last year of Nestle SA's ice cream business with R&R Group to create Froneri, a global ice-cream operator."
Ctit Group,"BofA's Rural Branch Exodus --- Bank shut 1,600 sites since financial crisis as it shifted from 'bigger is better' tack"," Sep 18, 2017",1,"Bank of America Corp. pulled all of its branches out of Indiana four years ago when it sold off a group of antiquated storefronts in Rust Belt towns. Later this year, the lender is returning but this time is targeting affluent customers in the state's largest city, Indianapolis.

The Charlotte, N.C., bank, the nation's second-largest lender, has closed about 1,600 branches since the financial crisis as it sought to rekindle sagging profits and focus on major metropolitan areas. The reductions are roughly equivalent to shutting all the Citigroup Inc. and Capital One Financial Corp. outlets in the U.S.

The strategy would represent a stark change for any big lender, but it is a particularly striking departure for a bank built over decades on the idea of offering a coast-to-coast network in areas both urban and rural. ""Bigger is indeed better,"" former Chief Executive Hugh McColl said when the bank was formed in 1998 by the merger of NationsBank Corp. and BankAmerica Corp.

But strains from the financial crisis led to a different approach. In 2009, the bank had branches in 725 U.S. counties, roughly one out of every four nationwide. In 2016, it was in 253 fewer counties, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of bank regulator data.

The bank has in recent years cut branches far more aggressively than J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. or Wells Fargo & Co., the two other U.S. banks with the most branches, according to the analysis. However, Wells Fargo, which had branches in more than 900 counties in 2016, may soon be taking a page from Bank of America's playbook. Seeking to bolster its bottom line after its sales-practices scandal, Wells Fargo in May announced plans to close about 450 of its roughly 6,000 branches in 2017 and 2018.

Bank of America no longer has a branch in places like Elkhart, Ind.; Dodge City, Kan., and Florence, S.C. In the Utica, N.Y., area, where there were 12 branches in 2009, there are now none.

""You can't be everywhere,"" said Dean Athanasia, co-head of the bank's consumer unit, in an interview. Nevertheless, he said the bank's footprint, with 4,542 branches, covers 80% of the U.S. population. ""I don't think we were optimally positioned before.""

In most counties the bank left, it sold at least some of its branches to smaller lenders, limiting the effect on those communities. In nearly one-quarter of the counties, Bank of America simply closed the branches, directing customers to other locations, sometimes dozens of miles away.

Meanwhile, Bank of America is opening new branches in a number of big metropolitan areas where it previously didn't have them, a rare move for a big bank in recent years.

With its emphasis on more urban markets, the bank in part is adapting to demographic changes.

Many rural areas have struggled with population decline and lower male labor-force participation as highly educated young workers flock to urban centers. But the bank also is grappling with the fallout of the financial crisis. New restrictions on overdraft fees also hit consumer-banking revenue, and a determination to avoid the mistakes of the subprime era led to a new focus on creditworthy customers.

Branches have also lost much of their reason to exist because routine transactions such as depositing checks and transferring money are increasingly done on computers or phones. Banks can't get rid of branches altogether, however, because many customers still pick their bank based on whether it has a nearby branch. Important product sales still happen there.

Older Bank of America branches were typically dominated by a long row of teller windows. In the newer branches, the tellers are sometimes in the basement. The new branches emphasize big-ticket purchases, with customers taking out a mortgage or addressing an account issue waiting on midcentury modern couches and checking in with a staffer holding an iPad.

When a banker emerges, he or she is expected to greet the customer by name, usher them into an office and slide the glass door shut. Many new branches feature a room devoted to Merrill Edge, an investing service for people with up to $250,000 in assets. Branches in new and existing cities are getting the layouts.

The approach stems in part from two big acquisitions. After dozens of traditional bank deals, in 2007 Bank of America bought U.S. Trust, a private bank that targets clients with millions to invest. The next year, it agreed to buy Merrill Lynch & Co. in the heat of the financial crisis.

Bank of America was hit hard by the financial crisis, receiving some $45 billion in aid from the U.S. Treasury. As a part of a plan to further stabilize the bank, Chief Executive Brian Moynihan announced plans in 2011 to cut $5 billion in annual costs in the consumer unit and related areas.

Pulling out of the rural branches was one way to reach the goal. The typical urban branch easily clears its roughly $900,000 annual operating cost with revenue of about $2.5 million, compared with $1.4 million for the typical small city or rural outpost, said Jon Voorhees, a Bank of America retail executive from 2004 to 2015 and now an industry consultant.

Once money became tight, ""why would I want to invest to rebuild"" in the less populated areas ""when I could build a branch in Manhattan?"" he asked.

The bank said revenue is just one of a number of factors it looks into when evaluating a branch, including deposit balances and client satisfaction.

Bank of America inherited some of its rural branches through deals that also included big-city locations. In the cities where the bank is opening its first branches such as Indianapolis, Denver and Minneapolis, it already has Merrill and U.S. Trust customers. In the Indianapolis area, there are about 128,000 wealth-management and commercial clients through its units.

Overall though, the bank has cut 1,597 U.S. branches since the beginning of 2009, which includes closures in counties where the bank maintains a presence. While revenue has been falling in recent years, profits have hit their highest point since 2006.

An Elkhart Dentist

Finds an Alternative

Gavin Schill said he might not have been able to start his dental practice in Elkhart, Ind., about six years ago if there hadn't been a Bank of America branch in town to give him a loan.

But now that the bank has left the area, Mr. Schill said he isn't sad about it.

Bank of America pulled its branches out of Elkhart and other towns in northern Indiana and southwestern Michigan in 2013. So far, there doesn't appear to be much economic damage from the move. That is in part because the bank sold the branches to a smaller lender.

In more than three-quarters of the 253 counties that Bank of America has left since 2009, at least some branches were sold, limiting harm to local communities, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of bank regulatory records.

Bank of America sold its Elkhart branch to Indiana-based Old National Bancorp as part of a broader branch-and-deposit sale in the area.

When Bank of America left Elkhart, Mr. Schill said he was annoyed that he had to switch banks. But he eventually refinanced his loan with Old National and said he prefers the personal attention they offer, including mixers for dentists at local restaurants.

""Elkhart wasn't worth their time,"" Mr. Schill said of Bank of America. ""I'm much happier now."""
Ctit Group,Goldman's Trading-Client Hunt," Sep 14, 2017",1,"Goldman Sachs Group has a plan to get its trading mojo back. The only thing standing in its way is literally every other bank on Wall Street.

Goldman outlined in some detail on Tuesday how it plans to boost revenue by $5 billion across various segments over the next three years. The focus was on fixed-income, currency and commodities, or FICC, trading, which posted disappointing performance over the last two quarters.

Harvey Schwartz, the firm's co-chief operating officer, said Goldman could boost revenue in this business by about $1 billion over the period. The bulk of those gains are to come from expanding Goldman's FICC market share, which it estimates has fallen to 10% over the past 12 months from 19% in 2009.

In particular, Goldman wants to broaden its client base away from hedge funds, which it dominates, to process more trades for corporate clients as well as traditional asset managers and other banks. The steady flow of business from clients like these can be less choppy, especially during periods of low market volatility. In fact, corporations were the only major client group in which Goldman was able to lift FICC sales in the first half.

The problem is that rivals like J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America are hardly eager to give this business up. These universal banks enjoy an inherent advantage in serving corporate clients because they already are heavily involved with processing their payments, cash management and other day-to-day financial flows.

If anything, the competitive environment is set to intensify as European banks return to health and to markets from which they pulled back in recent years.

Furthermore, the pie of available trading business isn't rising, making this a zero-sum game among banks.

Goldman's other growth plans look easier to achieve. In particular, it aims to increase lending to corporate clients, wealth-management clients and ordinary consumers. Goldman is starting from a low base in lending, so this will mainly be a function of how much capital it is willing to commit. The bank's strong position in merger advisory and wealth management also give it a pool of potential borrowers.

Though Mr. Schwartz didn't mention it, another key to turning around the trading business will be to avoid costly mistakes such as the directional bet on natural gas prices that cost Goldman dearly in the second quarter.

The first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem, which Goldman has done. Now, it needs to show it has the chops to take trading business from top rivals. Investors shouldn't assume it will go so smoothly as depicted in Goldman's presentation."
Ctit Group,Goldman Banks on Lending To Grow," Sep 13, 2017",0,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc., acknowledging that its storied securities-trading business is unlikely to pick up enough to be a key revenue driver, is now looking to the lower-octane business of lending to spur growth.

The New York firm said Tuesday that loans to wealthy clients, companies and consumers would contribute almost half the $5 billion in revenue growth it is projecting by 2020.

The pronouncement represents a growing acceptance on Wall Street, voiced by other executives this week, that trading revenues, which have declined in the past five years, aren't likely to return to past peaks anytime soon.

Harvey Schwartz, a top lieutenant to Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, on Tuesday said persistently low volatility in financial markets meant that the third quarter would be a ""challenging"" one in terms of trading. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. CEO James Dimon and executives at Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. projected trading declines of between 15% and 20% for the quarter.

Traders had hoped that an uptick in activity in late 2016 after President Donald Trump's election was a harbinger of better times, but now it looks increasingly like a blip. In recent months, optimism about a surging economy and rising interest rates has surrendered to worries about sluggish growth and low inflation. That is likely to keep a lid on rates and trading.

An environment of slow but steady growth and low rates has allowed markets to calmly rise. But there isn't enough trading activity to stoke growth at banks like Goldman.After nearly a decade of stagnation and cost cuts following the 2008 financial crisis, Goldman is gearing up to play offense, but it plans to rely less on trading than it had in the past.

Goldman on Tuesday laid out a detailed plan to grow revenue, which has remained flat since the financial crisis. Its target of $5 billion in new revenue by 2020 hinges on businesses that have been footnotes for most of the firm's 147-year history: lending, asset management and tending to the mundane needs of corporate clients and money managers.

The goals outlined by Mr. Schwartz would bring Goldman back to 2006 revenue levels. In other words, the firm is shooting by 2020 to have spent more than a decade treading water.

Lending to wealthy clients, companies and consumers could add $2 billion of new revenue over the next three years, said Mr. Schwartz at a global financial-services conference hosted by Barclays PLC. That is twice what a revamp of Goldman's vaunted bond-trading business could produce, he added.

""We're focused on the future,"" said Mr. Schwartz, Goldman's co-chief operating officer. ""And when I say focused, I mean completely obsessed.""

Investors cheered the plan, which was unusually detailed for a firm known for keeping its intentions close to the vest. Shares rose 2.2%.

Goldman has leaned on cost cuts, rather than revenue growth, to boost profit margins since the crisis. So have other banks, a trend that has sent Wall Street into a funk from which it has proven difficult to emerge. Gone are the bonus pools that often afforded Goldman employees the biggest bragging rights.

The cuts have put Goldman in a position to squeeze higher profits from extra revenue. Mr. Schwartz said as much as half of every extra revenue dollar from now on could end up on the bottom line.

""Our relative performance, in the long run, is totally within our control,"" Goldman CEO Mr. Blankfein said in a voice mail Tuesday to the company's 34,000 employees.

The biggest opportunity lies in lending, which Goldman once eschewed but more recently has embraced. The firm plans to put $28 billion more toward loans over the next three years, which would increase its loan portfolio by 40%.

Much of that, some $12 billion, will go toward the online consumer bank Goldman launched last year. It casts Goldman as a Main Street lender, but without physical branches, taking small deposits from individual savers and lending them back out.

Goldman is looking for new ways to lend, weighing secured loans such as mortgages as well as e-commerce loans offered to customers online, according to people familiar with the discussions. It recently partnered with Fidelity Investments to fund loans backed by household brokerage accounts.

Some analysts question whether Goldman can deliver on projections in areas it has only recently focused on. ""We are somewhat skeptical,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analysts wrote in a note. The firm is looking for growth ""outside of [its] traditional strengths.""

Trading revenues have stalled at most big Wall Street firms, and what remains is simpler, electronic and with lower fees.

The five biggest banks as a group saw trading revenue dip 12% in the second quarter. Volatility remains near record lows, despite worrying geopolitical headlines. Many investors are waiting for clarity on how soon and how quickly interest rates will rise.

What's more, many assets are trading within narrow price bands, meaning it is hard for brokers to make much money standing between buyers and sellers.

J.P. Morgan's Mr. Dimon predicted that busy markets will return. ""You will have volatile markets again,"" he said. ""People will panic, you will panic, running through the door like everybody else.""

Mr. Dimon said he may stop giving trading guidance because investors are too focused on near-term results. Earlier this summer, he chastised reporters on a press call for seeking intraquarter details about trading revenue."
Ctit Group,Hurricanes Gore the Oil Bulls --- More of the fuel is likely to wind up in storage as demand for crude takes a hit," Sep 12, 2017",1,"The havoc wreaked by major summer storms stands todeepen a global crude-supply glut that has depressed oil prices for more than three years.

By paralyzing giant swaths of the southern U.S. ranging from Texas to South Carolina for days at a time, hurricanes Harvey and Irma will dent energy demand from consumers and refiners even as drilling continues and crude in storage is abundant.

The effect, analysts say, will be to push millions more barrels of crude oil into oil caverns and floating tankers at a time when storage is already in heavy use. That will undermine efforts by producers such as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to rebalance the market by cutting output.

U.S. crude prices haven't exceeded $50 a barrel for more than a trading day since May, and futures for October delivery fell 3.3% Friday to $47.48 ahead of Irma's landfall. On Monday, crude settled up 1.2%, to $48.07.

While regional economic activity will gradually recover after the storms and rebuilding efforts will help to push demand higher, the disruptions are nearly certain to intensify the downward pressure on U.S. prices.

The sheer size of Harvey and Irma, two of the largest storms to hit the U.S. in recent years, likely will drive significant declines in consumption, said Thomas Pugh, a commodities economist at Capital Economics.

Mr. Pugh expects the impact from the two storms to exceed that of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which drove total U.S. oil demand down 2% from a year earlier in the three months that followed.

The scale of the storms points to an outsize impact on the oil market. Hurricane Harvey is expected to be one of the costliest storms in U.S. history, after dumping torrents of rain on the Greater Houston metropolitan area of more than 6.7 million people. More than 300,000 homes in Texas were damaged or destroyed by the floods.

Even more is potentially at stake in Irma, which hit Sunday in large sections of Florida, a state with more than 20 million people. Data provider CoreLogic Inc. estimated that 12 million properties in Florida could be damaged by winds or the storm surge.

The energy industry has already taken a significant hit. U.S. crude prices fell after Harvey hit the eastern coast of Texas and forced the shutdown of more than 20% of U.S. refining capacity.

Crude prices began recovering last week as refiners near the Gulf Coast planned restarts, easing demand concerns. Gasoline prices remain elevated, reflecting refinery outages and the vulnerability of the U.S. gasoline-distribution system to storms that hit the Southeast.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said Monday that the demand loss will be a ""bearish shock for global oil balances."" The bank estimated that U.S. crude inventories will climb by 40 million barrels in the month following Harvey, which would push stockpiles to nearly 500 million barrels.

Crude inventories declined steadily through July and August, which oil bulls took as a sign that the market was beginning to move back into balance.

But a buildup of 40 million barrels would negate most of those inventory reductions. On Thursday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that 4.6 million barrels of crude oil were added to storage in the week ended Sept. 1. Days of supply covered by inventories rose for the first time in two months to 27.5 that week, below the peak this year of 34.2 days, according to the EIA.

Some analysts are skeptical that hurricane season will have a long-term impact on the oil market. If refiners restart more quickly than anticipated, it could mitigate another wave of U.S. supply.

""It's definitely not good news in the short term,"" said Ed Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup Inc. But ""in the end, it's probably the case that supply and demand are balancing themselves out."""
Ctit Group,Citi Adds Another Banker From UBS," Sep 8, 2017",0,"Citigroup Inc. has tapped a UBS Group AG investment banker to head up its chemicals coverage for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the second time this week the big U.S. bank has announced a new hire from its Switzerland-based rival.

Mr. Weissenberger, with more than 18 years of investment banking experience, joins Citigroup after his most recent stint at UBS where he headed the chemicals sector for EMEA.

The addition of Mr. Weissenberger, 43 years old, is one of several recent hires by Citigroup from UBS's ranks to bolster its investment banking coverage of the EMEA region.

(WSJ Sept. 7, 2017)

Citigroup Inc. has created a separate services group within its investment-banking coverage of the industrials sector and appointed two global co-heads to oversee the new division amid a flurry of deal making in the payments-processing sector in Europe and the U.S.

Jean-Baptiste Petard is expected to join Citigroup in December as global co-head of the independent services division, according to a memo announcing the new structure, and work out of London.

Mr. Petard's appointment and his U.K. base underscore the potential of lucrative advisory work for investment banks amid a consolidation of the payments sector that is under pressure to cut costs and invest in new technologies to address the rise of mobile payments.

A seasoned investment banker, Mr. Petard was most recently at UBS Group AG, where he oversaw the Swiss bank's investment-banking operations for business services, transportation and logistics in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

At Citigroup, he will be based in London, focusing on clients in the business and payment-services sectors in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Mr. Petard will share global co-head duties for the new services division with Citigroup veteran Chad Hoeft, who will continue his coverage focus on the security, facilities-management and travel-services sectors.

Mr. Hoeft joined Citigroup in 1998, and has spearheaded its coverage of the services sector in North America for the past several years. He remains based in New York.

Ctit Group,Array of Threats Stir Up Markets," Sep 6, 2017",1,"U.S. government bonds rallied and banking and insurance stocks tumbled in the latest signs of rising anxiety hitting financial markets.

The action reflects a warning from a Federal Reserve official Tuesday that persistently low inflation could make it difficult for the central bank to continue raising interest rates as many investors expect. Adding to the pressure, Hurricane Irma is threatening the U.S. coastline and the U.S. is facing a potential confrontation with North Korea over nuclear tests.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 234.25 points, its largest one-day decline since Aug. 17, while gold, a haven in turbulent times, settled at its highest value since last September. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 2.072%, its lowest close since Nov. 9, the day after the U.S. presidential election. Bond yields fall as prices rise.

Tuesday's bond rally added to a two-month decline in Treasury yields, largely driven by a run of soft inflation data, which investors have been less willing to dismiss as resulting from one-time factors than some Federal Reserve officials.

Some investors said the combination of events Tuesday heightened concerns that many already had about the economy and global politics.

Skepticism toward the inflation outlook is shared broadly by investors, if not the majority of Fed policy makers, who have long said they expect inflation to trend higher. Implied inflation expectations, derived from the difference between nominal and inflation-adjusted Treasury yields, are forecast to be about 1.79% annually over the next decade, according to data from Tradeweb. That's down from more than 2% earlier in the year.

While North Korea's latest nuclear test and Hurricane Irma helped bolster Treasurys, the long-term argument for buying bonds also got a boost Tuesday from Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard, who said in a speech that the Fed's ""persistent failure"" to hit its 2% inflation target could merit a slower path of interest-rate increases going forward.

""We have been falling short of our inflation objective not just in the past year, but over a longer period as well,"" she said. ""My own view is that we should be cautious about tightening policy further until we are confident inflation is on track to achieve our target.""

Ms. Brainard has expressed concern about low inflation before. But her latest remarks came at a critical time, as Fed officials gear up for a debate over whether to stick to the central bank's plan of raising interest rates a third time this year or hit the pause button to wait for more inflation data and see how the economy and markets react to the latest political fights in Washington and natural disasters.

The decline in yields and the low spread between the two- and 10-year Treasury note are bad for banks. Banks in recent years have suffered from a narrow spread, which leads to a thinner gap between what they pay on deposits and charge on loans, a spread known as their net-interest margins.

Those margins had recently ticked up slightly, leading investors to expect bank profits could soon expand. Tuesday's bond-market action cast doubt on that expectation.

Shares of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. fell 2.4%, BankAmerica Corp.'s shares fell 3.2% and Citigroup's shares lost 2.1%. Shares in financial firms that aren't as sensitive to interest rates and lending, such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley, also fell sharply.

Insurers were among the S&P 500's biggest decliners, as Hurricane Irma threatened to do more damage to the U.S. coastline. Everest Re Group declined 6.9%, XL Group fell 5.8% and Travelers Cos. lost 3.7%.

Low inflation makes government bonds more appealing to investors because it helps preserve the purchasing power of their fixed payments. It also makes it less likely that the Fed will raise interest rates, which is another major threat to the value of outstanding Treasurys.

Since topping the Fed's 2% target in February, one of the Fed's preferred inflation measures, the personal-consumption expenditures price index, has been in retreat, rising just 1.4% in July from a year earlier, the Commerce Department said last week.

The inflation slowdown has surprised many investors and analysts because it has defied many economists' expectations that a low jobless rate should soon lead to higher wages and costlier goods and services.

The U.S. unemployment rate was 4.4% in August, just off a 16-year low, but wage growth and inflation have both remained sluggish. That has left investors debating whether tepid inflation and low bond yields could be the result of large, potentially intractable forces, such as globalization and technological advances, rather than just a consequence of the normal economic cycle.

""I think there's something really powerful"" happening, said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock Inc., the world's largest asset manager. Technological innovation from companies like Amazon.com Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc., he added, are behind ""the greatest cost revolution of all time,"" in a development that has far-reaching consequences for financial markets.

For years, some analysts have argued that technology and increased global competition as well as aging populations and mounting debt levels could all play some role in holding down economic growth, inflation and bond yields. What has changed, investors and analysts say, is how seriously these arguments are now being taken by market participants.

In recent years, investors have frequently blamed low yields on factors including monetary stimulus from major central banks or fears that the global economy could soon tip into another recession. But the Fed now has plans to start slowly reducing its large portfolio of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, after already raising interest rates twice this year.

Meanwhile, many investors also expect the European Central Bank to soon start scaling back its own stimulus program, as the entire global economy shows signs of improvement."
Ctit Group,Wells Fargo Raises Its Tally of Fake Accounts," Sep 1, 2017",0,"Wells Fargo & Co. said its sales-practices scandal was far broader than it had previously acknowledged, ensuring that the bank will continue to face scrutiny about a problem that has weighed on it for nearly a year.

Wells Fargo said Thursday that 3.5 million ""potentially unauthorized"" customer accounts were opened as a result of improper sales tactics, a 67% increase over the 2.1 million figure it made public last fall.

The disclosure, made at the conclusion of a review of the misconduct, comes against a backdrop of fresh missteps within Wells Fargo's consumer-lending operations and significant underperformance in the stock market compared with its big-bank peers.

The sales scandal erupted last September when the San Francisco bank admitted that employees opened customer accounts using fictitious or unauthorized information to meet lofty sales goals. The revelation led to congressional hearings, the abrupt retirement of its then-CEO and a decision by the bank's board to claw back tens of millions of dollars in compensation from some top executives.

Wells Fargo said Thursday that it is providing $3.7 million in additional customer refunds as a result of the revised count of fake accounts.

""We apologize to everyone who was harmed by unacceptable sales practices that occurred in our retail bank,"" Wells Fargo Chief Executive Timothy Sloan said in a statement. ""Today's announcement is a reminder of the disappointment we caused to customers and stakeholders,"" he added on a media call.

The latest disclosure is likely to keep the bank in the regulatory spotlight and boost the possibility of future congressional hearings, analyst Jaret Seiberg of Cowen Group Inc. wrote in a client note.

Although Wells Fargo agreed to a $185 million settlement with regulators last September, the sales-practices issues have sparked a number of federal and state investigations, including from the Justice Department.

Mr. Sloan, who took over from John Stumpf late last year, said on the media call that there aren't any updates on those investigations. The bank has said it is cooperating with the inquiries; Mr. Sloan declined to comment on conversations with regulators in light of its latest update. He also said the new account figures aren't likely to upend an agreement to pay $142 million to customers to settle a class-action suit.

Soon after the bank's announcement, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D, Mass.), a frequent Wells Fargo critic, wrote on Twitter that the latest information is ""unbelievable"" and that the bank's ""massive fraud is even worse than we thought.""

She reiterated her earlier call for the Federal Reserve to remove all Wells Fargo board members who served during the problem periods and for further congressional hearings.

The bank's board has said the practices leading to the unauthorized accounts went as far back as 2002.

Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee had already called for such hearings to examine issues that have recently emerged at the bank in regard to insurance products. So far, Republicans, who control both houses of Congress and committee leadership posts, haven't said if they would agree to the request.

Mr. Sloan said Thursday that the bank is continuing to reach out to all stakeholders and ""respond to questions and concerns that they have.""

The bank called the completion of the review, conducted by an unnamed third party, ""an important milestone,"" a view echoed by others. The fact that Wells Fargo is putting the scandal behind it ""is a positive in our view,"" wrote Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl, adding that ""we now expect the trickle of new information to slow considerably.""

Still, many investors remain wary. Wells Fargo's stock fell Thursday, lagging behind peers.

That continued a woeful period since the scandal unfolded. Over the past year, the bank's shares are barely changed. Meanwhile, its three big-bank rivals -- J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. -- have notched an average gain for the period of around 40%. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index is up about 28%.

Now isn't the time to buy Wells Fargo stock due to the poor sentiment surrounding the bank and drags on its business, said Christopher Walsh, an analyst at Buckingham Research Group.

Separately Thursday, regulatory filings from Vanguard Group showed it cast ballots earlier this year against Wells Fargo nonexecutive chairman Stephen W. Sanger and two other directors. In mid-August, Wells Fargo said that Elizabeth Duke, its current vice chairman, would succeed Mr. Sanger as chairman on Jan. 1.

Aside from the management and political upheaval, the sales scandal has also affected the bank's underlying consumer business.

The growth rate for new checking and credit-card accounts, for example, has fallen since last year's scandal to a year-over-year rate of about 1% to 2% in 2017's second quarter, Bernstein banking analyst John McDonald said in a recent report. That is compared with growth of 5% to 6% in 2016.

Mr. McDonald said that will hit revenue, weighing on card fees, net-interest income and deposit service charges.

In light of this, Wells Fargo has been forced to cut expenses, even as it tries to revive growth. Yet other issues have surfaced as the bank dug into the sales-practices scandal, adding to concerns.

Wells Fargo said in July it would reimburse customers for around $80 million due to problems in its auto-lending unit. These led to as many as 570,000 borrowers being improperly charged for insurance policies.

Wells Fargo said the increase in its estimate of potentially unauthorized accounts was partially due to it refining the analysis and methodologies used by an outside firm examining the problems. As a result, the number of potentially unauthorized accounts in the original 2011 to 2015 period grew to 2.55 million from 2.1 million.

After last fall's congressional hearings, the bank also said it would extend the time period under review to January 2009. That added 981,000 accounts that were potentially unauthorized. The analysis also found around 528,000 potentially unauthorized online bill-pay enrollments, and the bank said it would refund an additional $910,000 to customers who incurred fees or charges.

Wells Fargo added that out of the 3.5 million total potentially bogus accounts, around 190,000 incurred fees and charges, up from 130,000 previously identified."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Tax Plan Raises Red Flag for Bond Market," Aug 31, 2017",1,"Republican plans to scale back tax deductions on companies' interest payments risk pushing more borrowing overseas, say analysts and market participants, eroding the competitive advantage of the $6.053 trillion U.S. corporate-bond market.

Rep. Kevin Brady (R., Texas), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said this month that he wanted to curtail companies' capacity to deduct net interest payments from taxable income to pay for tax cuts. The comments virtually ensure the topic will feature prominently in the coming tax debate, which is expected to begin in earnest after Labor Day.

White House officials and top House Republicans say they are optimistic about finishing a major tax bill this year, but they have a long way to go. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump in a speech called on Congress to approve a steep cut in corporate tax rates and simplify the U.S. tax system.

Any U.S. limits on interest write-offs would diverge from the policies in many other rich countries and likely prompt companies to shift some borrowing to places where deductibility would still be in effect, many analysts say. Large U.S.-based companies such as Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. routinely borrow billions of dollars in the U.S., knowing that interest payments will lower their tax bills.

Ironically, a tax revamp meant to boost U.S. competitiveness and bring overseas earnings home may weaken a central pillar of the U.S. capital markets. ""If you remove interest deductibility in one location and retain it in others, then of course companies will want to move their borrowing,"" said Matt King, a credit analyst at Citigroup Inc.

A spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee said the tax cuts will help revitalize the economy, which will stimulate capital markets.

A debt boom after the financial crisis has only burnished the U.S.'s status as the world's largest bond market. Companies routinely borrow billions to build new factories, finance acquisitions and fund share buybacks. Nonfinancial, investment-grade companies in the U.S. have borrowed roughly $575 billion this year, on pace to break the record of close to $800 billion set in 2015, according to data provider Dealogic.

The U.S. corporate-bond market is almost triple the size of the euro corporate-debt market, the world's second largest, according to Dealogic.

The U.S.'s sophisticated market infrastructure and ample liquidity give corporations better access to debt financing than anywhere else. While those advantages make a wholesale shift to other borrowing markets unlikely, changing the tax code could push some borrowing into foreign markets, Mr. King said.

Debt is popular because it is cheaper than selling equity. Its low cost is enhanced by deductibility, which began in the early 1900s when railroad and real-estate executives persuaded the federal government that their businesses wouldn't survive if they paid interest with after-tax profits, said Steve Bank, a professor at the UCLA School of Law.

Ending or limiting that deduction is key to funding the House tax plan. Repeal would raise $1.5 trillion over a decade to replace some of the revenue lost from a corporate rate cut and immediate deductions of capital expenses, according to the Tax Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank.

Multinational corporations have shown they can deftly manage any difference between countries' tax policies to their benefit, said Brian Kittle, a tax lawyer at Mayer Brown LLP. Companies including Mylan NV, Medtronic PLC and Johnson Controls International PLC have in recent years moved abroad in part to lower their U.S. tax bills.

Removing interest deductibility would create a ""strange and ironic"" echo of such ""corporate inversion"" strategies in which firms move their headquarters overseas but keep their main operations in the U.S., said Citigroup's Mr. King. In this case, companies could keep their funds in the U.S. and borrow elsewhere.

Foreign companies already borrow in the U.S. to lower their tax bills. German industrial conglomerate Siemens AG has borrowed $21.25 billion in the U.S. investment-grade market since 2015.

Others are spreading their bets. Apple issued a 2.5 billion Canadian dollar ($2 billion) bond in August, the largest corporate borrowing by a foreign issuer on record there.

Companies are borrowing more now in anticipation of tax changes later, said Dominic Pappalardo, a portfolio manager at McDonnell Investment Management LLC."
Ctit Group,Crisis-Era Scourge Reignites Worries," Aug 29, 2017",1,"LONDON -- The synthetic CDO, a villain of the global financial crisis, is back.

A decade ago, investors' bad bets on collateralized debt obligations helped fuel the crisis. Billed as safe, they turned out to be anything but. Now, more investors are returning to CDOs -- and so are concerns that excess is seeping into the aging bull market.

In the U.S., the CDO market sank steadily in the years after the financial crisis but has been fairly flat since 2014. In Europe, the total size of the market is rising again -- up 5.6% annually in the first quarter of the year and 14% in the last quarter of 2016, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.

Collateralized debt obligations package a bunch of assets, such as mortgage or corporate loans, into a security that is chopped up into pieces and sold to investors.

The assets inside a synthetic CDO aren't physical debt securities but rather derivatives, which in turn reference other investments such as loans or corporate debt.

During the financial crisis, synthetic CDOs became a symbol of the financial excesses of the era. Labeled an ""atomic bomb"" in the movie ""The Big Short,"" they ultimately were the vehicle that spread the risks from the mortgage market throughout the financial system.

Synthetic CDOs crammed with exposure to subprime mortgages -- or even other CDOs -- are long gone. The ones that remain contain credit-default swaps referencing a range of European and U.S. companies, effectively allowing investors to bet whether corporate defaults will pick up.

Desperate for something that pays better than basic government bonds, insurance companies, asset managers and affluent investors are scooping up investments like synthetic CDOs, bankers say, which had largely become the preserve of hedge funds after 2008. Investment banks, which create and sell CDOs, are happy to oblige. Placid markets have made trading revenue weak this year, and such structured products are an increasingly important business line.

Synthetic CDOs got ""bad press,"" said Renaud Champion, head of credit strategies at Paris-based hedge fund La Francaise Investment Solutions. But ""that market has never ceased to fully function,"" he added.

These days, Mr. Champion still trades synthetic CDOs, receiving a stream of income for effectively insuring against a sharp rise in European corporate defaults.

Many investors, though, still view the products as unnecessarily complex and are concerned they may be hard to offload when markets get choppy -- as they did in the last crisis.

""We don't see that demand from our clients and we wouldn't recommend it,"" said Markus Stadlmann, chief investment officer at Lloyds Private Banking, citing concerns over the products' lack of transparency and lack of liquidity, meaning it could be hard to exit from a position when needed.

The return of synthetic CDOs could present other risks. Even if banks are currently less willing to lend money to help clients juice returns, credit-default swaps can be very leveraged, potentially allowing investors to make outsize bets.

Structured products accounted for nearly all the $2.6 billion year-over-year growth in trading-division revenue at the top 12 global investment banks in the first quarter, according to Amrit Shahani, research director at financial consultancy Coalition.

""There has been an uptick in interest in any kind of yield-enhancement structure,"" said Kokou Agbo-Bloua, a managing director in Societe Generale SA's investment bank.

The fastest growth this year has come in credit -- the epicenter of the 2007-08 crisis. The top 12 global investment banks had around $1.5 billion in revenue in structured credit in the first quarter, according to Coalition, more than doubling since the first quarter of 2016. Structured equities are largest overall, a business dominated by sales of derivatives linked to moves in stock prices, with revenue of $5 billion in the first quarter.

""The low-yield environment hurts,"" said Lionel Pernias, a credit-fund manager at AXA Investment Managers. ""So there are a lot of asset owners looking at structured credit.""

These days, the typical synthetic CDO involves a portfolio of credit-default swaps on a range of companies. The portfolio is sliced into tranches, and investors receive payouts based on the performance of the swaps. Those investors owning lower tranches tend to get paid more but are subject to higher losses if the swaps sour.

Synthetic CDOs have evolved since the crisis, bankers say. For instance, most are shorter-dated, running up to around two to three years rather than seven to 10 years. Some banks will only slice and dice standardized CDS indexes that trade frequently in the market rather than craft tailored baskets of credits.

There are also fewer banks involved in arranging these trades. Those active include BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Societe Generale SA."
Ctit Group,Blackstone Bets Big on Natural Gas," Aug 16, 2017",0,"Blackstone Group LP is making one of its biggest bets on the growth of natural-gas production, wagering that even if gas prices remain stuck at depressed levels, it can profit.

The New York private-equity firm has built a roughly $7 billion bet on natural gas by investing in drilling fields, pipelines and a gas export terminal. The latest piece came last month, when it agreed to pay $1.57 billion for a 32.4% stake in the Rover Pipeline, a 710-mile tube being built across Ohio.

Natural-gas investments have been popular in recent years among private-equity firms. Many investments count on prices rising to turn profits -- and have been doomed by low prices.

Blackstone says its wager is generally more dependent on production volumes increasing than on prices climbing. Most of the $7 billion has been put toward moving gas out of areas where drilling has increased despite low prices. The remainder has been invested in exploration and production in those regions.

""We're betting on which basins are going to be the winners,"" said David Foley, who leads the firm's energy investing.

He has put Blackstone's money down in West Texas, Appalachia and Louisiana.

Blackstone raised its latest energy fund, a pool with more than $8 billion, in late 2014 and early 2015, when collapsing crude prices stoked optimism that investors could snap up oil assets on the cheap.

The firm has invested billions in oil, but its splashiest deals have been aimed at natural gas.

The natural-gas gambit has grown into one of Blackstone's biggest, comparable in scope to its $10 billion bet on rental homes. But unlike home prices, natural-gas prices have a less-than-bright prognosis.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc. and others say that abundant supply, and production that can be ramped up quickly, should keep U.S. natural gas prices at an average of around $3 per million British thermal units for the next couple of years. Futures contracts for gas to be delivered in the winter, when demand and prices tend to be highest, don't exceed $3.50 per mmBtu until late 2027.

Natural gas for September delivery fell 2.4 cents, or 0.81%, Tuesday to $2.9350 per mmBtu on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Blackstone joins a crowded field of private-equity firms that have barreled into gas investments since the combination of horizontal drilling and a rock-cracking process called hydraulic fracturing unlocked new drilling fields across the country. These firms' cash helped feed a drilling frenzy that has produced a flood of the heating and power-generation fuel.

Some firms have made disastrous bets, underestimating the new drilling technology and how severely it would affect prices.

The Texas power producer formerly known as TXU Corp. was bankrupted by buyout debt after KKR & Co. and TPG bought the company in 2007 for $32 billion assuming that gas prices, and thus electricity prices, would remain high. Instead, shale gas flooded the market.

Another surge of shale gas sent prices spiraling down shortly after KKR and others paid $7.2 billion for oil-and-gas producer Samson Resources Corp. in 2011.

Samson's bankruptcy case is approaching its second anniversary.

But there have been enough successes to keep investor interest in natural gas alive.

KKR once made $1.5 billion in about a year by flipping Pennsylvania shale fields.

Big scores like that have helped draw more than $200 billion into energy funds since 2013, according to Preqin.

The earliest of Blackstone's natural-gas investments is poised to begin paying dividends.

In 2012, the company put $1.5 billion toward the construction of Cheniere Energy Inc.'s facility in Sabine Pass, La., to liquefy natural gas for export.

The facility, which last year became the first to ship U.S. shale gas overseas, is adding capacity and recently reached a construction milestone that triggered Blackstone's stake to convert to common shares of an entity that distributes 42.5 cents a share each quarter. With more than 202 million shares, Blackstone is due about $86 million quarterly, or $344 million annually.

The Rover Pipeline could be completed as early as autumn, according to Energy Transfer Partners LP, which is building the project.

The pipeline will connect some of the country's most prolific wells to markets around the Great Lakes and along the Gulf of Mexico. Once it opens, the Appalachian drillers who have signed up for shipping space on the pipeline will pay fees whether they send gas or not.

Earlier this year, Blackstone paid $2 billion for 375 miles of pipelines in West Texas that gather gas being produced as a byproduct of the frenzied Permian Basin oil drilling, and is therefore not particularly sensitive to gas price movements.

Mr. Foley says owning infrastructure like gas pipelines and export terminals is akin to selling supplies to speculators during the California Gold Rush.

""It's like picks and shovels for gold mining,"" he said. ""We don't really care about the gold price, we just need it to be sufficient that people continue to mine.""

Blackstone's strategy isn't without price risk. A decline much below $3 could hurt the firm's investments in exploration and production outfits. Persistently low prices have pressured such companies and limited the places where drilling is profitable."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Barclays Names Card Unit CEO," Aug 11, 2017",0,"Barclays PLC's international credit card unit is getting a new chief executive.

Barclaycard International has hired longtime card industry executive Barry Rodrigues to run its operations, a position that he is expected to take over in November, according to an internal memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Rodrigues joins from Citigroup Inc., where he was the head of digital payments in the global consumer bank, in charge of new payment solutions and the team that manages the bank's partnerships with PayPal and Apple and its relationship with Mastercard.

He will replace Amer Sajed, who retired in July. Mr. Sajed became interim CEO in May 2015 and took on the role permanently in April 2016. Barclaycard announced his retirement in March, at the time saying the bank would look at internal and external candidates for Mr. Sajed's replacement.

Under Barclaycard International, Mr. Rodrigues will be in charge of U.S. credit cards and retail online deposits as well as business solutions and payment acceptance in the U.K. He will also oversee the company's credit card and unsecured lending in Germany.

The move takes Mr. Rodrigues to a smaller but growing lender in the U.S. Barclaycard was the ninth-largest credit-card lender in the U.S. based on purchase volume and balances at the end of last year, according to trade publication the Nilson Report.

Its outstanding balances for general-purpose and co-branded cards totaled around $26.4 billion at the end of last year, up from about $6.5 billion in 2007 when the bank's ranking by this measure was 14th. Citi has remained among the top five U.S. credit card lenders during this period.

Mr. Rodrigues spent more than two decades at American Express before joining Citi in 2011. He followed Jud Linville, also a longtime AmEx executive, who joined Citi in 2010 and is the bank's chief executive of cards.

Barclaycard is most well known in the U.S. for its co-branded cards. The bank said in July that it will be the issuer of a new Uber credit card that is set to roll out later this year. It is also the issuer of the JetBlue credit cards, an account that was previously with American Express. Barclaycard is also one of the issuers for the American Airlines co-branded credit card program that it shares with Citi."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: BofA Plans a New Premium Card," Aug 10, 2017",1,"Bank of America Corp. is preparing to join the premium rewards-card fray, planning a new twist on hot products like the Sapphire Reserve card from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

Over the past year, rewards cards such as Sapphire Reserve and American Express Co.'s Platinum card have become sought after among millennials and big spenders. Cardholders can rack up more rewards with these cards, which they can use to cover travel and other expenses. The cards' popularity has prompted new entrants and ever-higher rewards -- and caused some concern among issuers, who fear an overheated market.

Bank of America is the last of the four largest U.S. credit-card issuers to enter the premium rewards-card market. Rolling out in September, its Bank of America Premium Rewards credit card will have a $95 annual fee, said Jason Gaughan, a card product executive at the bank. That is well below fees of $450 for Sapphire Reserve or $550 for AmEx's Platinum card.

Bank of America's card will distribute two points to cardholders for every dollar they spend on travel and dining and 1.5 points per dollar spent on everything else, without caps on the number of points users can earn. In this, it is similar to more mass-market cards from J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc.

But Bank of America cardholders who have at least $20,000 at the bank in checking, savings or investment accounts will earn more.

Customers who have between $20,000 and less than $50,000 at the bank will receive 2.5 points per dollar spent on travel and dining and 1.875 points on everything else. Those with between $50,000 and less than $100,000 will earn 3 points and 2.25 points, respectively.

At its most generous, the card offers 3.5 points per dollar spent on travel and dining to cardholders with at least $100,000 at the bank and about2.6 points per dollar spent on all other purchases. Customers must enroll in the bank's Preferred Rewards program to benefit.

The Premium Rewards card will also offer a sign-up bonus of 50,000 points to cardholders who spend $3,000 in the first three months from account opening -- one of the lowest spending thresholds among premium cards.

Bank of America's new card is designed to compete against a range of cards, including airline and hotel co-brand programs, said Mr. Gaughan.

Even so, questions are arising over how profitable some of these premium cards are. J.P. Morgan lowered its initial 100,000-point sign-up bonus offer earlier this year and is pushing for about $200 million in new cost cuts in the unit that oversees the card.

Among concerns in the card industry are so-called gamers, cardholders who sign up for the lucrative rewards offered early on but then stop using their cards when they redeem those rewards. Many issuers need to retain cardholders for several years or run the risk that revenue projections will fall short, said Brian Riley, director of the credit advisory service at Mercator Advisory Group Inc.

By linking rewards to account balances, Bank of America potentially reduces its exposure to gaming since banking customers aren't quick to move balances.

The card is an extension of the bank's Preferred Rewards program. Introduced in 2014, it offers higher interest rates for deposits and discounts on loan fees and interest rates in an attempt to get consumers to have more than one relationship with the bank. Bank of America launched the program as part of a post-financial-crisis strategy to encourage customers to do all of their saving and borrowing with the institution.

The bank said it is entering the premium card market to encourage existing customers to use its card over competitors and to bring in more deposits.

Bank of America is the second-largest credit-card issuer in the U.S., with around $102 billion in outstanding balances as of the end of 2016, according to trade publication the Nilson Report. J.P. Morgan is the largest issuer, with around $142 billion in outstanding balances.

Bank of America also has a deep pool of affluent clients. Its wealth-management division is among the largest in the U.S., with around $2.6 trillion in client balances in the second quarter of 2017. The bank isalso a large lender of jumbo mortgages, which are mostly geared toward the wealthy.

Bank of America's card will run on the Visa network."
Ctit Group,"Turnaround Not in Bag For Coach, Michael Kors"," Aug 9, 2017",1,"Coach is cool again, at least in the minds of investors. Much of Wall Street's high opinion of it comes from expectations for Kate Spade.

Shares of Coach have climbed 37% since the beginning of the year and 13% since the day before it announced its $2.4 billion deal to buy rival handbag and apparel maker Kate Spade on May 8. Coach and rival handbag maker Michael Kors have been working to patch up their businesses after overexpansion and heavy discounting hurt sales and margins.

Coach's return to positive same-store sales this year has been cheered by investors as a sign that its turnaround efforts are taking hold. Shares of Michael Kors had languished until Tuesday, when they shot up more than 20% after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings and raised its full-year guidance.

Michael Kors, which recently announced its own deal to buy Jimmy Choo, said it expects the deal to be accretive to earnings per share by the second full year.

Both companies now need to live up to the higher expectations. The first test for Coach will come when it reports earnings next week.

The company, which is hoping Kate Spade's colorful designs will help it attract younger consumers, said in May that the deal would deliver about $50 million in cost savings within three years of closing.

Yet as of Aug. 3, Coach's share price implied that the market was expecting pretax synergies of $233 million, according to an analysis by Citigroup.

This takes into account Coach's plans to stop selling Kate Spade's bags via online flash sales and to rein in its wholesale business.

The market appears to be ignoring some sizable risks. Reducing Kate Spade's flash sales could hurt its revenue. The Kate Spade brand was already showing signs of weakness, posting its first negative quarterly same-store sales figure since 2008 just before the announcement of the Coach deal.

Both Coach and Michael Kors are investor favorites again, but they know that the affair will be fleeting unless they keep delivering strong results."
Ctit Group,Instant Debit Cards? Not So Fast," Aug 9, 2017",1,"J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. has quietly canceled a popular program that allowed customers to replace lost debit cards at many of its 5,300 branches, respondingto factors including an uptick in fraud, according to people familiar with the matter.

The change means that customers who lose their debit card or have it stolen will have to wait for a new one to be mailed to them.

J.P. Morgan had machines to make the cards in about half of its branches, said one of the people familiar with the matter. That would be about 2,650 locations. The bank started eliminating the service in March, and finished late last month, the people said.

Other banks also have faced problems when expanding new financial technology. For example, some banks have placed more restrictions on mobile check-cashing technology to cut down on fraud, such as longer wait times for a deposit to post and dollar limits on daily deposits.

J.P. Morgan was one of the first major lenders to introduce instant-issue debit cards in branches, touting the service in a 2012 news release as ""a real time-saver for our customers.""

Since then, a cross-section of national, regional and local banks and credit unions have introduced the service, which often is used to quickly replace the cards of customers who might have been the victim of a retail data breach.

About two years ago, J.P. Morgan's Chase branches began to experience a jump in people coming in with fake IDs that matched customer information such as name and birth date, some of the people familiar with the matter said.

The swindlers then requested new replacement debit cards on the spot, the people said. They could use the new card made in the branch to make purchases or withdraw an unsuspecting customer's money from a teller or the bank's ATM. New pins are set for new cards.

After bank officials started noticing the problem picking up, Chase started requiring customers to produce the same form of ID they had used to open their account, such asa driver's license or passport.

""We found the issue and fixed the process almost two years ago, virtually eliminating the issue,"" said bank spokeswoman Anne Pace.

The more-recent decision to discontinue the service reflects numerous factors, she added, including a fresh push to cut costs and customers increasingly migrating to other payment options, such as mobile banking. Ms. Pace said the fraud issues covered less than 1% of all consumer-related fraud at the bank.

Not every bank agrees that these types of machines pose a security risk. TD Bank and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. still offer instant-issue debit cards, publicizing them as a way to get cards replaced faster. Companies that produce the instant-issue technology also have said it is a way to reduce theft through the mail.

The service is ""extraordinarily popular with customers,"" a PNC spokesman said.

In May, TD Bank released an adtouting its instant-issue cards. In the ad, a young woman leaves her wallet in a taxi, walks right into a branch, and has her card replaced instantly.

As of March, TD Bank had rolled out machines to produce full-function debit cards for all its U.S. retail locations. ""We have not seen an increase in fraud related to these machines,"" said TD Bank representative Lauren Schmidt.

Other large banks, such as Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co., offer temporary replacement debit cards in some branches, in part to reduce the possibility of fraud. J.P. Morgan is now offering a temporary ATM card at the branch, but not one that can be used as a debit card at merchants.

Some bank customers questioned J.P. Morgan on Twitter with sad or puzzled emojis after Chase removed the service.

""Chase really lost me with that one,"" complained one customer, Diron Gipson, last month. ""I need my debit card the same day! Not 5 days later.""

J.P. Morgan offers rush delivery of a new debit card that takes two or three days, but that also can carry a $5 fee.

Financial institutions using the technology are forecast to grow by about 65%, by 2021, according to a June report from research firm Aite Group.

Still, others have voiced concerns in addition to J.P. Morgan. Entrust Datacard Corp., which manufactures the machines that the bank used in branches for the instant debit replacement cards, co-wrote a 2015 white paper that advised companies using the machines to ""tighten know-your-customer protocol,"" while ""training employees to recognize in-person fraud schemes."""
Ctit Group,Oil's $100 Million Man Pays Price for Bad Bets," Aug 4, 2017",0,"Andrew Hall, a legendary trader who made billions betting on oil's rise, is shutting down his hedge fund after he misjudged the impact of a boom in U.S. production that upended the market.

Mr. Hall, who gained wide notice for fighting over a $100 million payout from his former employer Citigroup Inc. during the depths of the financial crisis, confirmed Thursday that he is closing the main fund at the firm he founded, Astenbeck Capital Management LLC.

The decision to close the fund follows years of investor defections and marks the latest reckoning for a Wall Street trader who struck out on his own.

Mr. Hall, 66 years old, is known for making big, long-term bets on rising oil prices, a strategy that worked well when commodities were soaring but has fared poorly as prices deteriorated in the past three years. His bullish stance on oil ran headlong into the shale revolution, which in the past decade defied predictions that the world would soon run out of easily accessible crude.

Mr. Hall, who left Citigroup in 2009, declined to comment on the timing or reason for his fund's shutdown. Bloomberg reported the news earlier.

One point of pressure recently: Blackstone Group LP, one of Astenbeck's first and largest investors, arranged to pull its clients' money from the main fund, people familiar with the matter said.

Mr. Hall will continue to manage some Blackstone money outside of the fund now closing, one of the people said.

Astenbeck's unwinding is the latest in what has been an escalating series of stumbles for Wall Street traders who created multibillion-dollar hedge funds off their reputations as big bettors at major investment banks.

Ex-Goldman Sachs Group trader Richard Perry, who made more than $1 billion for clients betting against subprime mortgages during the financial crisis, closed his eponymous hedge fund last year after a stretch of muted returns. Eric Mindich, the youngest partner in Goldman Sachs history, this spring closed his Eton Park Capital Management.

Mr. Hall was one of the biggest names of the era who remained in the game, but even he was overseeing a diminished empire at the end. Astenbeck was down to $1.8 billion firmwide as of May, an investor document indicates, less than half of what the firm managed in 2013.

Most of that was in the main fund, which is now being unwound.

The main fund lost 17% through April this year, after returning 26% in 2016 and losing 36% in 2015, according to the investor document. Since its inception in January 2008 through April 30, Astenbeck returned 1.65% after fees, the document shows.

The oil and commodities sectors once lured hedge-fund managers, who profited from soaring prices in the years before the global financial crisis.

Now few such specialists remain. Pierre Andurand's Andurand Capital Management LLP made 38% in its Andurand Commodities fund in 2014. But this year it is down 15% through July, said a person who had seen the numbers.

""Ten years of a commodity bull market are over, and that has been lost on a lot of people,"" said Ernest Scalamandre, managing member of AC Investment Management, which manages about $750 million in assets, primarily investments in commodities and commodity hedge funds. ""Technology is decreasing the cost of production.""

Banks have also scaled back in the markets amid regulatory scrutiny. Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse Group AG, Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. all have closed or curtailed operations in the sector, while Goldman Sachs reported last month its worst-ever quarter for commodities trading.

Mr. Hall was among those who bet heavily this year that efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies would help rebalance the oil market and lift prices.

But oil prices tumbled in the first half of this year. Many began to doubt that OPEC's strategy was working, and fled bets on rising oil prices. Still, Mr. Hall assured investors that the oil glut that weighed on the market would be eliminated, according to people familiar with the matter.

Since the oil downturn began in 2014, Mr. Hall has remained steadfast in his belief that the glut wouldn't last. In February 2016, he predicted ""rapid reductions in inventories"" and ""a sustained rise in prices"" to a range of $60 to $80 a barrel.

Mr. Hall has been trading oil for decades. He began his career at BP PLC during the oil crisis in the 1970s and eventually became known for his aggressive tactics, according to the 2010 book ""Oil: Money, Politics, and Power in the 21st Century."" Phibro, a commodity -trading firm, recruited and hired him in the 1980s.

Around 2003, Mr. Hall became convinced that oil prices were poised to break out of their longtime range of $10 to $30 a barrel as supply growth lagged behind rising demand. He bought contracts to deliver oil years in the future, which resulted in a big payday when oil prices rose.

As for the compensation controversy a few years later, the public outcry spurred Citigroup, a recipient of a federal bailout, to sell Phibro to Occidental Petroleum Corp. in 2009."
Ctit Group,Look Out Below! It's Earnings Day," Aug 3, 2017",1,"Investors are bidding up U.S. stocks as companies post bumper profits, yet they are often selling on the day these firms release results.

On average, the shares of companies reporting earnings have fallen 0.8% on the day those numbers have come out, according to Bespoke Investment Group LLC, whose research charted share performance from all U.S. corporations posting profit figures up until Friday.

Individual shares have had their worst performance on an earnings day since the first quarter of 2014, the data show.

This is because beating expectations was rewarded on average with just a 0.4% share rise on the day, whereas disappointing earnings were punished particularly hard, with the company's stock on average falling 3.4%.

It's especially surprising because, overall, investors have reacted positively to the earnings season. The S&P 500 index is up 2.2% since the start of July, when companies began to report second-quarter results.

That may say a lot about investors' increased caution about U.S. stock valuations, which remain high by historical standards, analysts say. It could also just be that optimism about a a good earnings season has led investors to buy shares ahead of results. About a quarter of firms have yet to report results.

""It's a pretty unforgiving market for specific names, even as markets go up,"" said Mark Sherlock, portfolio manager and head of U.S. equities at Hermes Investment Management.

Large U.S. companies are on track to post two consecutive quarters of double-digit-percentage profit growth for the first time since 2011. More than 70% of S&P 500 companies have surpassed expectations this earnings season, figures from FactSet show. That's the highest share since FactSet started collecting this data in 2008.

Investors still found things not to like on earnings day.

The stocks of big banks, like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. , Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG , fell even as they reported better-than-expected profits.

Technology companies like Google parent Alphabet Inc. and eBay Inc. also saw their shares drop on the day they reported despite also beating estimates.

""The 'sell the news' action we're seeing suggests that investors are likely a bit uncomfortable with the market right now,"" said Justin Walters, Bespoke's co-founder.

Many analysts have long warned that U.S. stocks could be overvalued after their long rally, which has been fueled by the robust global economy and a run of stronger earnings.

S&P 500 shares trade at 19 times the earnings that they are expected to produce in 2017, which is high by historical standards. The tech-oriented Nasdaq Composite Index is up 18% year to date and now trades at 25 times the earnings it is expected to yield this year."
Ctit Group,Goldman Is Rattled by Slump," Aug 2, 2017",1,"After catching a tennis match at Wimbledon in July, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trading chief Pablo Salame paid a visit to the London offices of bond-fund giant Pacific Investment Management Co.

He had one burning question for his client: ""How can we do better?"" according to people briefed on the July meeting.

The visit was more than a typical sales call. In the wake of a trading slump that has Goldman lagging behind Wall Street rivals, Mr. Salame, the bank's top trading executive and a member of Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein's inner circle, has been on a charm tour, trying to win more client business by showcasing a friendlier, humbler Goldman.

Goldman, long Wall Street's trading powerhouse, is struggling to adapt to changes in financial markets. The day following Mr. Salame's visit, Goldman reported quarterly trading numbers that were the worst on Wall Street. Those followed a disappointing first quarter.

A 40% second-quarter decline in fixed-income activity, which includes bonds traded by Pimco and its ilk, left Goldman with first-half trading revenue that trailed its major competitors -- a first since Goldman went public in 1999.

The slump has rattled executives, who are now more focused on solving clients' problems rather than steering them into trades that benefit the firm's bottom line.

It has also tipped the scales in favor of more immediate action at the firm, despite a yearslong debate around whether changing market conditions were temporary or deep-rooted and how aggressively Goldman should respond to them.

""It could be secular, it could be cyclical, doesn't matter, who knows?"" finance chief R. Martin Chavez said last month on the bank's earnings call. The bottom line: The firm has to go where its clients want to go.

Mr. Blankfein, himself a former trading executive, has scheduled one-on-one meetings with some of the firm's top traders, according to people familiar with the matter.

Senior executives and salespeople have fanned out to top clients, pitching trade ideas and talking down the bad quarter, according to people on both sides of the outreach.

The firm also is leaning on its investment bankers to pitch their corporate clients on hiring Goldman's traders for products that protect against swings in currency values and interest rates.

Meanwhile, Goldman is working with a financial-data company to better understand what percent of each client's trading business it is getting, and how it can sell more products to existing clients, said people familiar with the matter.

Trading is the engine that has historically powered Goldman. The firm led the development of the institutional stock-trading market in the 1960s and dominated it for decades. In the 2000s, it was at the forefront of an explosion of complex debt instruments that ushered in a golden age of Wall Street profits.

Even after postcrisis declines, trading still accounts for almost half of Goldman's revenue.

Big banks make fees by arranging trades for clients, ranging from simple corporate bonds to complex derivatives tied to interest rates or currency prices.

The more complex instruments, which are often used by active investors like hedge funds, command higher fees. Plain-vanilla products are a low-margin, high-volume game.

Market and regulatory changes since the financial crisis have hit Goldman especially hard. Regulations closed its proprietary desks, which once made billions of dollars betting with the firm's own money.

A steadily rising stock market has also pushed investors away from risky investments and toward simpler products where giant banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. dominate.

Goldman's trading desk, by contrast, has been more geared toward hedge funds -- which have been less active as they face outflows and more trading moves to exchanges.

""The business changed around them,"" said James Mitchell, an analyst with Buckingham Research Group. ""If you're a hedge fund and you're worried about investors pulling money next quarter, are you really going to be asking Goldman to build you a five-year yen swap?""

The shifting ground caused consternation within Goldman. In March 2016, a fixed-income sales executive, Tom Cornacchia, spoke publicly of an internal split between those who believed the business had changed for good and those betting on a return to the past.

Mr. Cornacchia cast himself in the former camp, which felt the firm needed to adapt. The executive -- who left the firm last September -- said he had urged salespeople to be more patient and more client-focused, not to expect to land a trade with every phone call.

For a firm that has long hunted big game -- and where bonuses are set by ""gross credits"" that correspond to an employee's revenue generation -- that was uncomfortable for some, Mr. Cornacchia said. ""There's a lot of denial,"" he said at the time.

Meanwhile, Goldman ceded ground to rivals. Among top U.S. trading firms, Goldman has lost 10 percentage points of fixed-income market share by revenue since 2010 to J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup Inc., according to regulatory filings.

In the first quarter, Goldman's fixed-income revenue was essentially flat from a year earlier, compared with double-digit percentage gains at J.P. Morgan, Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup.

The firm was on the wrong side of the ""Trump trade,"" stockpiling products it expected clients would desire as long-term interest rates rose and the dollar gained in value, according to people familiar with the matter. Instead, long-term rates fell relative to short-term ones, and the dollar slid in March.

In the second quarter, the culprit was the commodities unit, which posted its worst three-month stretch in Goldman's 18 years as a public company. The business ended the quarter in the black but barely, as the bank struggled to adequately hedge its inventory, according to people familiar with the results.

Goldman has responded by turbocharging a push -- begun about two years ago -- to court mutual funds, asset managers and other ""real money accounts.""

These investors typically have long-term horizons and are less prone to flameouts than hedge funds, which can close their doors after a few bad quarters.

It has bolstered a sales group started in 2014 under partner Stacy Bash-Polley that aims Goldman's sales firepower at its biggest and most profitable clients.

Besides his visit to Pimco in July, Mr. Salame, the Goldman trading executive, also visited J.P. Morgan's asset-management division."
Ctit Group,HSBC Prepares Regular Buybacks," Aug 1, 2017",1,"LONDON -- HSBC Holdings PLC said that it would regularly buy back shares if it has extra capital, its latest sign of strength.

HSBC said Monday it will buy back a further $2 billion in shares, adding to the $3.5 billion in stock it repurchased since last year. The transaction announced Monday is part of a new pledge by the bank to regularly buy back shares if it can, in contrast to the earlier purchases that were specifically linked to capital it freed up by selling its large Brazilian unit.

Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver said that HSBC will review potential buybacks every half year and go ahead with them if it has surplus equity and nothing more attractive to invest in.

The bank has been adding capital through profit as well as by shrinking in some areas, and analysts had expected more cash returns. Factors helping the bank in recent quarters include lower bad loans and rising interest rates on an expanding deposit base.

On Monday, the bank said net profit for the second quarter rose 57% to $3.87 billion from $2.47 billion a year earlier. Profit before tax rose 47% to $5.3 billion.

Mr. Gulliver, in an interview, said the bank is seeing the fruits of the strategy he laid out in June 2015, including getting more cross-unit business from its 38 million customers.

Revenue that can be attributed to cross-selling rose to $5.9 billion in the second half from $5 billion in the first half of 2016, he said.

Analysts covering banks such as HSBC Holdings, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. have sought proof that the universal banking model is suited for an industry hobbled by banking rules and capital charges since the financial crisis.

HSBC says its global reach should be a magnet for companies looking to trade or invest overseas.

For the first half, revenue fell 11% to $26.2 billion from $29.47 billion a year earlier.

Net profit in that period rose 10% to $7 billion from $6.36 billion a year earlier."
Ctit Group,Credit-Card Losses Flash Warning," Aug 1, 2017",0,"Losses for credit-card issuers are increasing, a reversal from a six-year trend that could be a warning sign for markets and the broader economy.

The average net charge-off rate for large U.S. card issuers -- the percentage of outstanding debt that issuers write off as a loss -- increased to 3.29% in the second quarter, its highest level in four years, according to Fitch Ratings. The quarter was also the fifth consecutive period of year-over-year increases in the closely watched rate. All eight large issuers, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Capital One Financial Corp. and Discover Financial Services, had increases for the quarter.

The trend, which accelerated in the first half of this year, has started to suppress bank earnings. If consumers' budgets get more stretched, a pullback in spending could put pressure on both economic growth and corporate profits.

While losses are rising, they remain low compared with historical levels and a record 10% net charge-off rate they hit in early 2010. Lenders say they aren't expecting a return to crisis-level losses and that the increases are largely a return to normal after a period of abnormal lows.

Still, some bankers have noted the change in direction, a streak of widening losses in the industry after 24 quarters in which they shrunk. ""The overall environment is deteriorating,"" said David Nelms, chief executive at Discover. It is ""not quite as favorable as it was over the past few years.""

In 2010, when credit-card write-offs started declining, banks lent mostly to creditworthy borrowers. But starting around 2014, many lenders loosened underwriting standards substantially, turning to subprime borrowers with lower credit scores who are charged higher interest rates.

That contributed to a new boom in credit-card spending. Card balances nationwide rose 6% over the past 12 months through May, a growth rate that is up from about 1% four years ago, according to the Federal Reserve.

Rising balances, however, also have coincided with the recent loan losses and put a dent in what has been one of the healthiest credit-card markets on record.

The missed payments and increase in losses are having knock-on effects on lenders' earnings. Many posted double-digit-percentage year-over-year increases in the money they set aside to cover future card losses.

Discover shares dropped 4% on Thursday, the day after the company reported that it increased loan-loss provisions by 55% and raised guidance for its 2017 overall net charge-off rate. It is ""hard in the short term to grow earnings when credit is moving against us,"" Mr. Nelms said.

The rising losses are occurring during a time of near record-low U.S. unemployment, which suggests that credit performance could quickly weaken should the jobs situation turn.

""That's a little concerning,"" said Michael Taiano, a director at Fitch.

During the first-quarter earnings period, some lenders and analysts pointed to delays in tax refunds as a possible reason for the pickup in card-related losses. But this quarter, charge-offs kept rising for many lenders, fortifying worries that consumers are taking on too much debt.

The card market is an indicator of consumers' ability to pay back their debts. Unlike mortgages, a much broader group of consumers have access to cards. And these accounts can fall low on the priority list of bill payments when household finances are tight.

While overall consumer balance sheets look healthy, according to Federal Reserve data, some numbers suggest they are starting to stretch. For retail-store cards offered by Synchrony Financial and Citigroup, customers' balances are growing at a faster pace than their purchases, indicating they are slower at paying down their debts.

Card losses in the U.S. are up at most big banks, including those that specialize in subprime lending or store credit cards. The net charge-off rate at Capital One in the second quarter increased more than a percentage point from the year prior. Citigroup's store-card figure increased 0.63 percentage point, while Synchrony's overall rate rose more than 0.90 percentage point.

Broader consumer figures also point to overleveraging. Nonmortgage consumer debt payments, including credit cards and auto loans, account for the largest share of consumers' after-tax income since 2009, according to an analysis by Barclays PLC.

So far this year, several card lenders, including Capital One and Synchrony, have raised projections for charge-offs. Investors are jittery about more revisions.

Alliance Data Systems Corp., the third-largest issuer of store cards by outstanding balances, had been guiding investors to afull-year 2017 loss rate in the mid-5% range. In July, though, it wouldn't commit to that figure when pressed by analysts on its earnings call.

The company also reported a net charge-off rate for cards of 6.2% for the second quarter, up 1.1 percentage points from a year earlier. Its shares plummeted more than 9% that day.

Credit cards also moved to the top of the list of concerns about potential losses in the Federal Reserve's annual stress test of banks in June. The central bank said lenders would incur $100 billion in projected credit-card losses in a severely adverse hypothetical recession, tied with commercial and industrial loans. Cards ranked third the year before.

""We've seen an inflection point in credit,"" said Charles Peabody, managing director at Compass Point Research & Trading LLC. ""It is going to get worse from here."""
Ctit Group,European Investment Banks Suffer From American Envy," Jul 29, 2017",1,"Life isn't getting any easier for Europe's investment banks.

A string of results on Friday showed they are falling further behind U.S. rivals in the business of trading bonds and currencies, although some are doing better in equities. Low volatility at home and a lack of scale in the more active and profitable U.S. market are taking their toll.

In investment banking, advising on deals and capital raising, Europeans are performing worse, too, with only UBS Group getting close to the revenue gains reported by U.S. banks.

The trouble for the Europeans is that the more money U.S. banks make in their domestic market, the more firepower they will have to deploy on winning business elsewhere. As banks such as Morgan Stanley and Citigroup return to strength, the White House's deregulatory agenda for banks might give this extra impetus.

Credit Suisse Group stood out as having a particularly rough second quarter, mainly due to a much worse performance in both equity and bond trading in Asia, a market on which it is pinning its turnaround story.

Low volatility in currencies and weak activity among clients in interest-rate-related trading hurt all banks. Only Deutsche Bank, which reported Thursday, did marginally better than the U.S. average, although the German bank fell down on its equities business, which saw the biggest revenue drop among its peers.

One bright spot for several banks was the business of funding equities trades for hedge funds, which makes Deutsche's major loss of ground there look doubly painful. BNP Paribas appeared to benefit most from Deutsche's woes, with its equities revenue up 24% from the second quarter of 2016 in dollar terms, although it said strong equity derivatives results were also a big part of that.

BNP's revenue gains were far ahead of the pack. Barclays and UBS both managed to do a little better than the U.S. average of a 1% increase. Barclays's equity revenue rose 4% in dollar terms and UBS's was up 3%.

There is a further threat to European banks in the form of planned changes to global capital rules that could increase equity requirements. This has become somewhat less of a concern since rule makers said banks are likely to have up to 10 years to meet updated rules.

Meanwhile, European banks' best hope is that U.S. regulators don't loosen the leash on American banks too much. Otherwise, the Europeans will have little chance of recovering lost ground."
Ctit Group,"FDA Puts Squeeze on Cigarettes --- Aim is to cut nicotine to nonaddictive levels, as agency redirects antismoking strategy"," Jul 29, 2017",1,"U.S. health officials said Friday they want tobacco companies to make all cigarettes with such low levels of nicotine that they are no longer addictive, part of a sweeping regulatory overhaul that threatens Big Tobacco's main moneymaker.

The Food and Drug Administration also said it would encourage smokers to switch to products such as e-cigarettes and smokeless tobacco that are less dangerous than cigarettes. The harm-reduction strategy is a break by the U.S. government from an abstinence-only approach to fighting tobacco-related diseases and deaths.

Shares of major tobacco companies, which have been reaping growing profits in the U.S. market even as the number of smokers dwindles, tumbled Friday on the surprise move. Marlboro maker Altria Group Inc. fell 9.5%, while British American Tobacco PLC, maker of Camel cigarettes, dropped 6.8%, erasing tens of billions of market value.

""The problem isn't just nicotine, the problem is the delivery mechanism,"" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said at a press conference Friday.

Nicotine hooks people on cigarettes, but nicotine itself doesn't cause cancer, heart disease or lung disease, he noted. It is other harmful compounds in cigarette smoke that kill 480,000 people in the U.S. each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""Cigarettes will likely remain incredibly toxic,"" he said. ""We may be able to reach a day when the most harmful products will no longer be capable of addicting our children.""

In addition to pursuing regulation to ""render cigarettes minimally addictive,"" Dr. Gottlieb said the FDA would consider a ban on menthol cigarettes.

The announcement is the biggest step by the U.S. government to curb smoking since a landmark legal settlement in 1998.

In addition to paying more than $100 billion to help states pay for health care, tobacco companies agreed to restrictions on the use of cartoons in marketing, as well as transit advertising, billboards and free product samples.

""This is a huge switch from the 'tobacco-free world' approach to tobacco and nicotine by U.S. government agencies,"" said David Sweanor, a Canadian law professor and tobacco expert who supports the harm-reduction approach.

The FDA began regulating the industry in 2009 but that move in some ways proved beneficial to Big Tobacco by grandfathering in cigarettes already on the market and eliminating regulatory uncertainty.

Altria, which supported the 2009 legislation that gave the FDA authority to reduce nicotine levels, said ""any proposed rule such as a nicotine product standard must be based on science and evidence, must not lead to unintended consequences and must be technically achievable.""

BAT's U.S. subsidiary Reynolds American, which also sells nicotine gum, e-cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, said: ""We are well prepared and look forward to participating in a thorough process to develop a comprehensive plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation.""

Some tobacco analysts were skeptical, saying such regulation would take years to develop and would likely be litigated. Others questioned the public-health benefit, suggesting smokers would just smoke more cigarettes to compensate for the lower levels of nicotine.

Citigroup analyst Adam Spielman said the FDA will be hard-pressed to lower nicotine to nonaddictive levels because defining that level is difficult and there would be political opposition.

There are different ways to reduce nicotine in cigarettes. Manufacturers can lower the level by adjusting the blend of tobacco leaves or use different types of paper or filters. Nicotine can also be stripped from the leaf in the manufacturing process.

Products with very low levels of nicotine have never garnered a significant share of the U.S. market. In 1989, Philip Morris Cos., the firm now known as Altria, introduced an ultralow-nicotine cigarette called Next De-Nic, created by stripping out nicotine similar to the way caffeine is removed from coffee beans. It didn't remain long on the market.

The FDA also said Friday it will allow more time for makers of e-cigarettes and vaping products to submit products for agency review."
Ctit Group,Sapphire Reserve Card Loses Luster," Jul 29, 2017",1,"J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s Sapphire Reserve credit card has been popular with consumers -- maybe too popular.

Some at J.P. Morgan are raising concerns that Sapphire Reserve won't make money for the bank, due in part to high demand and the card's generous rewards.

Meanwhile, the lender is pushing for about $200 million in fresh cost cuts in the retail-banking unit that oversees the card, people familiar with the matter say.

The scrutiny inside the bank reflects changing economics of the competitive premium card market. Rewards for consumers -- paid for by the bank -- have gotten sweeter. Spenders are becoming savvier about maximizing benefits and avoiding balances that pad banks' profits.

J.P. Morgan says it is making a long-term bet on the millennial customers who favor the card. Prospects will become clearer in August, one year after its launch, when the first Sapphire Reserve customers will decide whether they want to spend another $450 on the card's annual renewal fee, without the generous sign-up rewards. If many flee, it would add to the anxiety.

Gordon Smith, head of J.P. Morgan's retail-banking business, this month ordered up cost trims at the unit overseeing cards, the people familiar with the matter said. A bank spokeswoman, Trish Wexler, said any midyear cuts would take into account overall expense targets regardless of specific products.

""As part of any planning process you're always looking for ways to eliminate waste,"" she said. ""That's just good fiscal hygiene.""

Still, internal concerns about the card are on the rise, surprising for what has been seen as a blockbuster at the nation's largest bank by assets. At recent meetings, senior J.P. Morgan employees reviewed models questioning whether the card would make money and when, the people familiar with the process said.

Banks such as J.P. Morgan generate credit-card revenue from the annual fees customers pay, the interest charged on their balances and the fees merchants pay when the card is used at their businesses. The bank pays out when it offers rewards, such as the 100,000-point sign-up bonus that J.P. Morgan initially offered on Sapphire Reserve.

The bank offered the bonus for about five months after the card's launch.

It estimated the reward was worth about $1,500 per customer if used on travel, along with a $300 annual travel credit.

J.P. Morgan doesn't disclose how many Chase Sapphire Reserve cards it has issued. The bank said it exceeded its 12-month sales target in two weeks and temporarily ran out of the metal used to make the cards.

J.P. Morgan's second-quarter card income, as reported, fell 15% from the year-earlier period to $1.06 billion. Credit-card account openings, excluding commercial cards, totaled 2.1 million, down 22% from the year-earlier quarter.

Executives at J.P. Morgan acknowledge the bank doesn't immediately make money on each new card and customer. ""You expense the acquisition costs over 12 months. The benefit comes over seven years,"" J.P. Morgan Chairman and Chief Executive James Dimon said on a conference call this month.

""These are the customers that everybody wants to acquire,"" Marianne Lake, the bank's chief financial officer, said on the call. ""We now have them, and we intend to deepen relationships with them.""

The big question is whether the consumers want to stay in this relationship. Customer renewal rates for premium credit cards can range from 60% to 90%, said Robert Hammer, founder and CEO of credit-card industry consultant R.K. Hammer. Some 5% to 10% of card holders tend to shop around, looking for new rewards, he said.

American Express Co.'s Platinum card and Citigroup Inc.'s Prestige card have been pushing to win over Sapphire Reserve customers. J.P. Morgan has tried to avoid signing up potential defectors by rejecting applicants who have opened up five new credit cards in the previous 24 months, known internally as the ""5-24 rule.""

""They may need to recalibrate those benefits"" that come with the Sapphire Reserve card, said RBC Capital Markets banking analyst Gerard Cassidy.

One problem for Sapphire Reserve: Fewer customers than the bank initially anticipated are holding balances, according to the people familiar with the matter. That lowers interest income generated by the card and forces the bank to focus on merchant-driven ""interchange"" revenue -- the card fees that stores pay to the bank -- which at about 2.5% of dollars spent is generally less lucrative than interest income.

Cardholders have proved adept at squeezing the most rewards out of Sapphire Reserve, often using it for travel and dining, categories in which J.P. Morgan generally pays more to cover rewards. Consumers also are likely to book travel through Chase's rewards website for an additional 50% bonus that the bank covers.

Sapphire Reserve customers have been helping the bank in other ways, though. About 4,300 cardholders have applied for new mortgages with J.P. Morgan under a program offering 100,000 reward points. That is about twice the number of mortgage applications from other Sapphire card customers last year, Ms. Wexler said.

""More than 95% of our customers are spending actively, are digitally engaged, and are retaining their relationship with us,"" she said. ""It's still early, but we've never seen numbers like this.""

Ctit Group,Libor's Demise Reflects Era of Runaway Greed," Jul 28, 2017",0,"The world's most important number will be no more.

Libor -- the London interbank offered rate -- was created in 1986 to help banks set interest rates on big corporate loans. Thirty-one years later, a top U.K. banking regulator said the benchmark would be phased out over the next five years.

Libor is calculated by asking banks how much it theoretically would cost them to borrow money from other banks. It wasn't designed to be anything more than an invisible bit of financial wiring, hidden deep below the surface of the banking system. Nobody expected it to become a foundation of global finance or a synonym for one of the era's biggest banking scandals.

Libor started out as a symbol of the clubby and arguably incestuous world of London banking in the 1970s and '80s. Libor was based on something resembling an honor system.

Libor quickly came to symbolize much more: the globalization of finance and the adrenaline-crazed, anarchic environment that overtook the banking system in the years leading up to the financial crash last decade.

Banks, driven by a rational desire for ever-increasing profits, rushed to create newfangled products that their traders used to place bets on the future direction of interest rates and many other trends, and Libor became a crucial ingredient. The lobbyist group that ran Libor, the British Bankers' Association, hungered for new revenue sources and concocted dozens of new flavors of its product, across different currencies and time periods.

By the late 1990s, the once-obscure benchmark expanded to a core component of trillions of dollars of derivatives and other financial contracts.

Meanwhile, American banks adopted Libor to determine what borrowers paid on variable-rate mortgages, student loans and, more recently, credit cards. Libor soon was buried in the fine print of countless contracts all over the world.

Because most derivatives aren't traded on public exchanges, it is hard to say exactly how vast Libor's reach is, but studies have estimated that hundreds of trillions of dollars of financial contracts world-wide are based on the benchmark.

That was great news for the BBA, which triumphantly coined the phrase ""the world's most important number."" That wasn't much of an exaggeration. The London lobbying group was unregulated, and so was its primary product. A gusher of licensing fees poured into the BBA, which used the funds to push a deregulatory agenda.

But Libor was rife with problems. Its method of calculation -- the BBA simply asked banks to estimate how much it might cost them to borrow -- was inexact at best. And the lack of government supervision proved an invitation for banks to manipulate the number.

Banks had huge stakes in the direction of Libor. The profitability of their loan portfolios hinged on the benchmark's fluctuations. And bank traders, with huge holdings of interest-rate swaps and other derivatives, had billions of dollars riding on tiny swings.

It turned out that banks were skilled at getting Libor to move in favorable directions. After all, it was their employees who were guesstimating their borrowing costs, so it was simple enough to skew those figures in helpful directions.

Tom Hayes, a UBS Group AG and Citigroup Inc. trader who in 2015 was convicted as the ringleader of a Libor-manipulating crew, once estimated that perhaps 5% of his hundreds of millions of dollars in trading profits stemmed from his ability to get Libor nudged up or down by fractions of a percentage point. And he was hardly alone; dozens of other traders and bank managers were involved in similar manipulative behavior (although Mr. Hayes, sentenced to 11 years in prison, is currently the one of the few behind bars).

When the industry's shenanigans first came to light in 2008, they were greeted by indignant denials from banks, regulators and, most of all, the BBA.

But government investigations soon showed not only that manipulation was widespread and easy to pull off, but also that government officials and central bankers had known for years about Libor's vulnerabilities but failed to act.

More than a dozen banks ultimately paid roughly $10 billion in penalties related to their fraudulent Libor activities. Senior executives at banks including Barclays PLC, Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC and Dutch lender Rabobank Groep NV lost their jobs. The scandal-tarred BBA was recently disbanded.

The era of financial anarchy gave way to a period of intense regulation and risk aversion by banks. Libor -- a potent symbol of the heady precrisis days -- couldn't survive in that new climate.

Central bankers and regulators in the U.S. and U.K. have been reviewing whether it is possible to make Libor safer. Their ultimate conclusion is that the current system is essentially unworkable; there is no way to guarantee the integrity of a benchmark that is based purely on guesswork by banks, especially when those banks have powerful interests in the outcome of their assumptions."
Ctit Group,Copper Finds New Reason to Advance --- Prices at highest since May 2015 as China's growth offsets lack of U.S. infrastructure plan," Jul 26, 2017",1,"Copper, once buoyed by optimism over President Donald Trump's infrastructure plans, is now being powered to fresh highs by optimism over China.

Prices for July delivery closed up 4.1% Tuesday at $2.8405 a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, its highest since May 2015. The industrial metal used for manufacturing and construction has increased in 10 of the past 12 sessions and is up 14% in 2017.

Copper got an additional boost Monday after the International Monetary Fund increased its growth expectations for China in 2017 and 2018 while leaving its forecast for the global economy unchanged and trimming its forecast for the U.S. The IMF also raised its growth estimates for Europe and Japan.

On Tuesday, copper eclipsed its previous 2017 high from February. Back then, strikes at mines and hopes that Mr. Trump would quickly push through an infrastructure plan had extended a rally that started in October. Around February, nervousness that a U.S. infrastructure package could take longer than expected and concerns over China and supply caused copper to start to retreat. Prices fell 10% by early May.

Since the low in May, prices are up 14%, getting a boost from supply threats and a brighter outlook on the strength of the world economy, particularly in emerging markets, according to investors and analysts.

""Even in the absence of the U.S.'s increased expenditure on infrastructure, global infrastructure spending remains very strong"" driven by robust Chinese demand, said Nitesh Shah, a commodities strategist at asset-management firm ETF Securities.

A report from Citigroup Inc. on Monday showed that Chinese imports of refined copper rose from a month earlier. China accounts for nearly half of the world's copper consumption, and its faster-than-expected economic growth and increase in industrial production have helped drive prices higher.

Caterpillar Inc. reported Tuesday that Chinese demand for equipment to carry out infrastructure projects fueled a 10% increase in second-quarter revenue from the previous year. Shares of the manufacturer posted their highest close since March 2012.

Meanwhile, investors are monitoring Chinese monetary policy for signs of tightening, which could slow demand for copper.

Many analysts have also said they will watch closely how mine disruptions affect supply. Strikes at copper mines in Chile and Indonesia have swung prices this year and could lead to short-term price volatility, analysts said. Strikes often boost metals prices as they crimp production.

On Thursday, the International Copper Study Group released data for April showing that world refined copper usage exceeded production for the second straight month.

Hedge funds and other speculators are positioned for further gains in the metal. Net bullish bets on copper futures by the group rose to the highest level in five months in the week ended July 18, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. Bullish bets outnumbered bearish ones by 74,233, the most since Feb. 21.

Many investors now have doubts that Mr. Trump will be able to unleash a huge infrastructure package soon. However, political uncertainty in the U.S. has spurred a retreat in the dollar. That is adding to support for the prices of copper and other metals, since a weaker dollar tends to help dollar-denominated commodities by making them more affordable for holders of other currencies.

""I'm not sure that a big, extensive infrastructure program is in the cards anytime soon,"" said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities in Toronto. ""People are still thinking that it's a possibility, but it's one that is diminishing."""
Ctit Group,Greece Returns to Global Debt Markets --- Bond swap represents nation's first foray into sector since brief participation in 2014," Jul 25, 2017",0,"Greece is returning to international bond markets for the first time in three years, seeking to swap a bond coming due in 2019 for a new one that will mature in 2022.

The country on Monday offered holders of a 2019 bond with a 4.75% coupon the potential option to cash in their securities; it will complete the deal if it gets enough demand for replacement bonds. It hasn't determined the price and terms for the replacements. The deal is expected to close Tuesday.

Greece isn't expected to raise extra debt in the deal; the stretching out of maturities is meant as a show of confidence -- and a way to deal with a big hump of debt repayments in 2019.

The 2019 bond has just over 4 billion euros ($4.67 billion) outstanding, and bondholders who participate in the swap will have made a hefty return: Greece will pay 102.60 euros per 100 euro face value -- close to the market price on Friday. A year ago, the bond was trading below 90 euros.

The banks mandated as joint lead managers are BNP Paribas, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and HSBC.

Athens has been shut out of international bond markets since 2010, except for a brief window in 2014. The move aims to build on the positive momentum created since the government concluded the bailout negotiations with its international creditors, recent upgrades by credit-rating firms and a rally in Greek bonds in recent weeks.

Greece has about 34 billion euros in outstanding euro-denominated bonds in private hands -- 10% of its debt load.

The government hopes that the swap, along with a few more similar moves before the end of its bailout, could mark the beginning of the end of eight years of economic and social upheaval.

Greece's current bailout program ends in July 2018. After that, the country needs to be able to fund itself from the capital markets, or it would require another bailout to remain solvent. The European Union, including Germany, would like to end the bailouts that have caused great political friction for the currency bloc, according to EU officials.

Greece tapped the markets in 2014 with five-year and three-year bond issues in April and July 2014, respectively. The first transaction exceeded expectations and the issue was seven times oversubscribed, raising 3 billion euros at a yield of 4.95%, but the next sale found just enough buyers, raising 1.5 billion euros.

Later in 2014, Greece also persuaded some Treasury-bill holders to exchange their bills for the bonds.

Before its bailout era began, Greece was last in the markets in April 2010, when it sold seven-year debt at a 6% yield. That issue was barely covered by investor demand, and within weeks Greece was forced to seek aid from its eurozone peers and the International Monetary Fund. It has since then agreed to three bailout programs."
Ctit Group,Bank Pay Quietly Shrinks --- Industry had adopted Dodd-Frank guidelines before SEC backed off rules on compensation," Jul 24, 2017",1,"Trump administration regulators have signaled they want to abandon long-simmering plans to further regulate pay on Wall Street -- but it may not matter.

Aspects of the Dodd-Frank law passed in 2010 under President Barack Obama along with changes in the economics of the banking industry have already resulted in tighter compensation controls.

Portions of the Dodd-Frank mandate -- including making pay more sensitive to risk and long-term results -- have made it into guidelines adopted by the Federal Reserve and other agencies. Banking groups have said their members follow the guidelines, but Washington and Wall Street have wrangled for years over whether they need to be locked in with formal rules.

Last week, regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped efforts to craft those tougher provisions from their published agendas. Those proposals included longer deferment periods for bonuses and longer periods during which the payouts are subject to potential claw backs.

An SEC spokesman declined to comment on the changed agenda. But Republican lawmakers and regulatory officials have long complained that Dodd-Frank included many measures unrelated to the financial crisis that spurred it passage.

Barney Frank, the former Democratic congressman who co-sponsored the landmark legislation, said he was unhappy but not surprised that regulators under the Trump administration are halting work on the rules. Because of GOP majorities in Congress and a Republican president in the White House, he says,the agencies ""will be able to get away with much of this.""

In theory, a regulatory pullback now could prompt banks to resume some precrisis practices, such as cash bonuses that are free from multiyear vesting periods or dropping provisions that claw back pay for bad behavior.

But big banks already have made moves to rein in pay, pressured by shareholders seeking higher dividends and stock buybacks and as they work under higher capital requirements that have pressured profitability and squeezed the amount of money available for compensation.

""At this point, restrictions on comp may be superfluous,"" said Guy Moszkowski, a veteran banking analyst and managing partner at Autonomous Research. ""None of these firms want to pay people more than they have to.""

The average bonus paid in New York City by securities firms was $138,200 in 2016, down 28% from its 2006 peak, according to a report by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli.

A senior trader who earned $2 million in total compensation before the crisis would be making about $1.2 million today, according to Michael Karp, chief executive of Wall Street recruiting firm Options Group.

High pay for traders and bankers has long been an issue, especially when Wall Street rebounded in 2009 due in part to $245 billion in government aid to banks.

""I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat cat bankers,"" Mr. Obama said that year. ""You guys are drawing down $10, $20 million bonuses after America went through the worst economic year that it's gone through in decades.""

Under that pressure, Wall Street reduced pay and deferred more of it so that employees' actions could be more accurately gauged over a longer time period.

Some bank boards have also tightened executive pay for top executives. Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., was compensated $22 million for his work in 2016, about one-third of his $68.5 million pay package for 2007.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s chief, James Dimon, also had his overall decline to $28 million from $30 million over that time frame.

Dodd-Frank supporters argued that the precrisis banking culture rewarded swinging for the fences without regard for risk. When traders entered insurance-like contracts that generated instant revenue, they kept big cash bonuses -- even if the trade blew up later and cost the bank billions. The incentive compensation restrictions in Dodd-Frank were designed to show there are consequences of making bad trading or management decisions.

""That's a serious issue that goes beyond whether these guys make too much money,"" said Mr. Frank.

Trading desks also produced many outsize gains for the banks. Individual traders would take a share of the winnings, sometimes raking in tens of millions. One oil trader, Andrew Hall, famously earned a roughly $100 million bonus at Citigroup in 2008 after a run of profitable years.

Today, however, those desks are mainly shut down, and the swashbucklers who ran them have departed, largely for hedge funds. The Volcker rule, adopted as part of Dodd-Frank, bars deposit-taking banks from proprietary trading, or making bets on the bank's own behalf with borrowed or customer money.

Now, traders remaining at banks must complete paperwork attesting that when they do take bets, it facilitates or anticipate the needs of a client.

Accordingly, the revenue for banks' trading has shrunk from about $205 billion in the precrisis era, to about $160 billion in 2016, according to Morgan Stanley and consulting firm Oliver Wyman.

Still, Dodd-Frank called for bank regulators to pass a rule preventing incentive-pay structures that encouraged excessive risk-taking. Last year, Mr. Obama personally urged regulators to finish the rule before his term ended. In April 2016, the six agencies involved delivered a new proposal on incentive pay.

The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, whose members include the largest broker-dealers, argued the rule was unnecessary, saying existing guidelines and industry practices sufficiently regulated pay practices and allowed a tailored approach for different banks.

The rule wasn't completed before President Donald Trump took office in January.

The Federal Reserve still has the rule on its near-term agenda, but the SEC and two other bank regulators took it off. For the rule to pass, Dodd-Frank called for multiple regulators to jointly adopt the same rule."
Ctit Group,U.S. News: Financier's Road To White House Job," Jul 22, 2017",1,"New York hedge-fund investor Anthony Scaramucci, President Donald Trump's newly appointed communications director, didn't jell with the president right away.

But over time and after flirtations with other Republican candidates, Mr. Scaramucci, nicknamed ""The Mooch,"" warmed to Mr. Trump, donating to his campaign and positioning himself for a White House job that didn't come right away.

""I love the president,"" said Mr. Scaramucci, 53 years old, at the White House Friday afternoon. ""I've been very, very loyal to him, and I'm going to do the best I can with my heart and soul on this job and try to serve him the best way that I can.""

A self-described diva, Mr. Scaramucci's move to the White House is the latest triumph in a career advanced through self-promotion and persistence.

After he was fired in 1991 by Goldman Sachs, where he was a real-estate investment banker, he started and sold a money-management firm to Neuberger Berman Group Inc.

Then, after an initial attempt at launching a fund-of-funds firm that essentially failed during the 2008 financial crisis, he purchased Citigroup Inc.'s hedge-fund management group and renamed it SkyBridge Capital.

He also launched the lavish SALT conference (for SkyBridge Alternatives), a Las Vegas affair that attracted big-name hedge-fund players, celebrities such as Will Smith and world leaders, including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

His path to Mr. Trump's inner circle was a winding one, including fundraising for two Trump rivals. Eventually, he signed on to raise money for Mr. Trump.

To take the administration job first promised to him, Mr. Scaramucci sold his stake in SkyBridge. The deal fetched about $250 million, according to a person familiar with the matter.

SkyBridge, which says it helped clients invest $12 billion in total as of Nov. 30, recently reported that its main fund was down 1% last year, its second consecutive year of losses. Some of SkyBridge's competitors, such as funds run by Carlyle Group, have closed outright, while others have merged."
Ctit Group,Regulators Retrench on Pay Rules --- Move is part of effort to pull back from measures deemed unfriendly to business," Jul 21, 2017",1,"WASHINGTON -- Several regulators have dropped pursuit of a long-running plan to restrict bonuses on Wall Street, as part of a wider effort to stop working on unfinished rules put in place after the financial crisis.

Government agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and several banking regulators, were directed under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law to develop compensation rules intended to curb excessive risk taking. Former President Barack Obama, during his last year in office, personally urged regulators to finish the rules before his term ended.

The six agencies delivered a new proposal in April 2016, but that was too late to push through a final version of the rule before President Donald Trump took office in January.

New regulatory agendas unveiled Thursday by the SEC and others show leaders excluded any mention of the restrictions, including longer deferment periods for bonuses and the amount of time payouts are subject to potential clawbacks. The proposal had targeted executives at some of the nation's largest financial firms, including investment managers and mortgage-finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but the stiffest rules were reserved for big banks.

The shift, disclosed in a semiannual list of pending regulations federal agencies provide to the White House's budget office, discloses how regulators in the Trump administration have started pulling back from postfinancial crisis rules. New SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has outlined a more business-friendly agenda, including promoting more ways for companies to raise capital in public markets.

""We've moved beyond commissioners and staff who were deeply involved in trying to fix things after the crisis,"" said Tyler Gellasch, a former Democratic Senate aide who is now executive director of Healthy Markets Association, a group of mutual-fund managers and pension funds. ""The priorities are more commensurate with where the economy and financial system is today.""

Rules requiring compromise among multiple regulators have proved to be heavy lifts. Agencies first proposed the incentive-compensation regulation in 2011, but questions about which employees should be covered and how to apply the restrictions to firms with different business models bogged down further progress.

It isn't clear what consequences agencies would face if they abandon the proposal. Republican lawmakers, who control both houses of Congress and opposed Dodd-Frank, won't force action. Some advocacy groups that backed Dodd-Frank have sued the SEC to finish rules, including one that required oil and gas companies to report payments they make to governments for mining rights.

""Its pretty outrageous that independent financial regulatory agencies appear to be thumbing their nose at Congress and statutory mandates,"" said Andy Green, managing director for economic policy at the liberal Center for American Progress.

The agencies' leaders also could defend their inaction by citing other regulatory priorities and noting they could revive measures not included on the agendas outlined Thursday.

""The agenda gives you a sense of where the agency is going to focus its resources, but it is not dispositive about what it ultimately will or will not do,"" said James Burns, a former senior SEC official who is now a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP.

The SEC's updated agenda was crafted in the spring, when an acting executive, Michael Piwowar, ran the commission. Mr. Piwowar, who is back to serving as an SEC commissioner, said earlier this year that he wouldn't prioritize Dodd-Frank rules. Mr. Clayton took office in May, so the agenda could further change in the fall when he issues an update.

Government efforts to restrict traders' and bankers' bonuses prompted a lobbying counteroffensive by Wall Street. Financial regulators in turn have struggled for years to craft the joint rule, which Democrats in Congress intended to restrain risk taking at big banks and brokerage firms.

The proposal was excluded from the SEC's agenda as well as lists disclosed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. However, the Federal Reserve maintained the proposal on its agenda.

An SEC spokesman declined to comment on the extent to which the commission has stopped working on the congressionally mandated rules. The Federal Reserve declined to comment.

The restrictions would have required the biggest financial firms to defer payment of at least half of executives' bonuses for four years, a year longer than what is common industry practice.

The plan also would require a minimum of seven years for the biggest firms to claw back bonuses if it turns out an executive's decisions hurt the institution or if a firm has to restate financial results.

Wall Street bonuses have come down significantly since the financial crisis, when record payouts against the backdrop of a worsening economy and bailed out banks heaped public and political scorn on the financial sector.

The average Wall Street bonus rose 1% in 2016 to $138,210, according to a March estimate from New York state Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli.

That is 28% lower than the peak hit in 2006.

The newly released SEC agenda also dropped mention of a rule that would require public companies to disclose a standardized metric comparing executive pay with stock performance.

It also omits any mention of other unfinished Dodd-Frank rules that govern trading of swaps, a type of contract that allows investors to bet on asset prices without owning the underlying stock or bond. The global swaps market is dominated by large banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc."

Deal Enables Link

To PayPal Accounts

Two of the highest-profile companies providing mobile wallets in the U.S., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and PayPal Holdings Inc., will now be partners as well as competitors under terms of a deal announced Thursday.

The agreement helps broaden the reach of J.P. Morgan's Chase Pay service, a smartphone application the bank launched last year to drive usage of its credit and debt cards for in-store and internet purchases.

The deal, expected to be fully rolled out by 2018, will also make it easier for customers to load their J.P. Morgan cards into PayPal's rival application and let them use their reward points to pay for goods and services through PayPal.

""These are parallel strategies,"" said Jennifer Roberts, the J.P. Morgan executive overseeing Chase Pay. ""We want to be where our customers are.""

The rapid growth in mobile-payment transactions has drawn interest from firms in several industries, from smartphone makers like Apple Inc. to credit-card networks like Visa Inc. and retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc., and led them to develop their own digital wallets to capitalize on the opportunity.

The volume of mobile online retail payments in the U.S. is expected to reach nearly $319 billion in 2020 from $122 billion in 2015, according to consulting firm Javelin Strategy & Research.

PayPal has a leg up over many of those other companies thanks to its nearly 20-year history in e-commerce. The company says it has 94 million active U.S. customers, and Morgan Stanley analysts said last year that PayPal was accepted at 73% of large internet retailers.

Since last summer, the San Jose, Calif., company has been angling to handle more payments that happen at physical retailers.

The J.P. Morgan agreement enables its cardholders to pay via PayPal in stores. Previously signed deals gave the same option to PayPal users who hold cards issued by Citigroup Inc., Discover Financial Services and Wells Fargo & Co as well as users of Android Pay and Samsung Pay.

BLACKSTONE GROUP

Private Equity, Real

Estate Lift Results

Blackstone Group LP's second-quarter profit rose, helped by appreciation in its private-equity and real-estate holdings, though a measure of its income came in lower than Wall Street expected.

Global economic growth and sustained investor appetite for stocks, debt, real estate and other assets have buoyed the portfolios of the New York private-equity firm and its peers and given them an open window to sell prior years' investments. Blackstone's private-equity holdings appreciated 2.8% during the quarter. Its ""opportunistic"" real-estate funds, which make speculative investments in offices, warehouses and shopping centers, rose 5.4%.

""Globally we see a benign business environment, with steady if unspectacular growth across most major economies,"" Blackstone President Hamilton ""Tony"" James said on a call with reporters.

The firm's $104 billion real-estate business, its largest division by assets, led earnings growth as it sold shares of Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. and office buildings acquired in the 2007 buyout of Equity Office Properties Trust during the quarter.

A decade of recovery in real-estate markets has reversed early losses on the prefinancial crisis bets of investors such as Blackstone, which acquired Hilton for $18.5 billion and Equity Office for $39 billion in 2007.

In June, Blackstone struck a deal to sell Logicor, a European logistics real-estate firm, to affiliates of China Investment Corp. for about $14 billion.

For the quarter, Blackstone's earnings rose to $342.8 million, or 51 cents a share, from $198.6 million, or 30 cents a share, a year earlier.

Its economic profit, a closely watched measure of performance that reflects changes in the value of unrealized investments, rose 36% to $705.4 million, or 59 cents a share, though it missed analysts' estimates for 62 cents.

Assets under management rose to $371.1 billion from $368.2 billion the prior quarter and $356.3 billion a year earlier."
Ctit Group,Bank Earnings Highlight Diverging Paths Since Crisis," Jul 20, 2017",1,"Morgan Stanley in 2009 was worth $50 billion less than its longtime rival, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. After reporting strong earnings on Wednesday, Morgan Stanley has nearly closed that gap.

The surprising turnabout between the two rivals shows just how much has changed on Wall Street since the financial crisis: Boring is beating swashbuckling.

Goldman's strengths -- making market bets and serving hedge funds -- have been zapped by new regulations and investors' aversion to risk. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, has cut traders and trained those who remain to take fewer risks, while adding to businesses that make money reliably and aren't penalized by capital rules.

The quarter was challenging for the industry as trading sputtered and loan growth stalled in spots. All six of the big banks beat analysts' earnings expectations, but they sometimes required the help of noncore businesses such as private investing. Shares of Bank of America Corp. fell after its earnings release on Tuesday as investors fretted about net interest income falling from the first quarter due in part to lower long-term bond yields. And J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., while reporting record profit, trimmed its outlook for the second half.

Morgan Stanley's results had no such caveats, with contributions spread evenly among its traders, investment bankers and stockbrokers.

It has been a remarkable run for the bank and its chief executive, James Gorman, who in 2010 took the reins of a firm humbled by the financial crisis and strategically adrift. His decision to de-emphasize trading and embrace wealth management -- a business he once ran for Morgan Stanley -- has paid off, producing steady growth and winning over investors who had stayed away after repeated burns.

""These changes don't happen quickly, they happen over many years,"" Mr. Gorman said Wednesday in an interview. ""Much of it came together in this quarter. I wouldn't run a victory lap around it yet, but this is proof of the model.""

Morgan Stanley's shares rose 3.3%, bringing the firm's market value to $86.2 billion, compared with Goldman's $87.7 billion. Also contributing to the narrowing gap this week was a sharp drop in trading reported by Goldman on Tuesday.

In some ways, both firms aren't the top players they once were. The two are now eclipsed in trading revenue by J.P. Morgan, Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America, which have used their sheer size to dominate the new high-volume, low-margin trading landscape.

But Goldman and Morgan Stanley are old rivals. They spent decades dueling as private partnerships and came through the financial crisis as the only two large stand-alone investment banks to survive. But Goldman emerged stronger and stuck to the strategy that made it the most envied trader on Wall Street, even while peers like J.P. Morgan and Bank of America bulked up.

Morgan Stanley decided it had to evolve, buying Citigroup Inc.'s Smith Barney brokerage and slashing trading businesses. The firm didn't catch up to Goldman quickly, slowly closing the gap first in revenue and then in profitability.

For the quarter, Morgan Stanley reported a profit of $1.8 billion on revenue of $9.5 billion, both up from the year-earlier period and better than analysts had expected.

While the second half of the year may prove tougher, the first half has been a validation of Mr. Gorman's reshaping of a firm he joined relatively late in his career. A former management consultant brought over from Merrill Lynch in 2006 to run wealth management, he ascended to the corner office after the crisis humbled Morgan Stanley's trading desks, and then-CEO John Mack, a former bond salesman, retired.

In 2009, Mr. Mack and Mr. Gorman struck the deal to buy Smith Barney. The purchase added heft to Morgan Stanley's wealth-management business, which remained hobbled after a tumultuous 1997 merger with Dean Witter. In 2009, the business made a profit of about $380 million. This year, it is on track for $4 billion, with remarkably steady revenue. On 98% of trading days in 2015, the unit brought in between $50 million and $70 million.

That predictability is an antidote to more-volatile trading business, which the firm has been shrinking. Last year, Mr. Gorman and top lieutenant Colm Kelleher, a former trading chief, fired 25% of fixed-income traders and slashed the capital available to the unit for bets.

Still, that division -- which trades everything from corporate bonds to oil to interest-rate swaps -- has kept revenue from falling sharply. It has made more than $1 billion in revenue for five straight quarters, hitting a goal Mr. Gorman set last year.

On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley reported $1.2 billion in revenue from the division, outperforming Goldman for the second straight quarter thanks to strong trading in currencies and corporate debt.

Including Morgan Stanley's stock traders, the firm reported trading revenue for the quarter of $3.2 billion compared with Goldman's $3.1 billion.

During the first half, Morgan Stanley's overall trading revenue surpassed Goldman's for the first time since at least the financial crisis.

Part of the story is that Goldman has stumbled. Its traders, once dominant on Wall Street, are struggling to find their footing amid sweeping market changes since the crisis. Trillions of dollars have shifted to passive funds, and then came a down spell for hedge funds as well as a long stretch of calm in the markets -- all of which have reduced demand for the complex products that are Goldman's signature."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Frankfurt Hub Is Set to Pick Up the Pieces," Jul 20, 2017",1,"FRANKFURT -- Germany's financial hub is taking an early lead in attracting banking businesses in anticipation of Britain exiting the European Union. Its main asset: stability.

Banks from Japan's Nomura Holdings Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. to the U.S.'s Citigroup Inc. are shifting some business to Frankfurt given the possibility that the U.K. will be left out of the single market once it leaves the EU. This would prevent banks in London from being able to serve customers across the Continent.

Following U.K.'s Brexit referendum in June 2016, many European capitals began lining up to woo some of these firms.

France has promised changes to cut labor costs, and Italy is changing its tax policies to make it less burdensome for bankers and other professionals. Spain's markets regulator is trying to make Madrid more international by hiring native English speakers to revise and edit all communications the agency sends out in English. But it is Frankfurt with its low-key approach that has been getting the biggest response.

""Stability is the one thing all banks are looking for, and in this regard Germany, with its stable economy and politics, is a winner,"" said an official at a bank that is shifting some business to Frankfurt.

Detmar Loff, a partner at law firm Ashurst, which is advising banks on their Brexit choices, also points to a well-educated workforce that speaks English, reasonable costs and a reliable regulatory environment as reasons for the German city's early success. Frankfurt is also home to the eurozone's banking supervisor, the European Central Bank, which often summons bankers to discuss their businesses. Being close to the ECB, bankers say, makes that easier.

Paris, which many touted as a big contender for Brexit businesses, has suffered from political uncertainty surrounding this year's elections. Emmanuel Macron, France's new pro-business president, is stepping up efforts to bring firms to the capital, but it has secured only one big bank. HSBC Holdings PLC has said it would transfer about 1,000 jobs to France, where it already has a retail presence.

It is too early to tell how many financial firms -- and people -- will converge on the German city of 730,000, which gets sleepy on weekends when many expat workers go home while others retreat to the residential suburbs in the surrounding hills.

Sumitomo Mitsui Financial, Nomura and Daiwa Securities Group Inc. separately said they would set up subsidiaries in Germany, but didn't provide staffing figures. Citigroup is planning to make Frankfurt its broker-dealer business hub outside London by adding about 150 positions in its business already set up in the city, according to a person familiar with the plan.

Morgan Stanley is close to picking Frankfurt as its EU hub, according to a person familiar with the plan. But both Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are also expected to shift some jobs to other capitals, including Paris and Dublin.

Frankfurt Main Finance, the group that is promoting the financial center, estimates that more than 10,000 jobs will come to the city in the next six years as a result of Brexit, adding to the existing 75,000. That is still a fraction of the more than 700,000 people who work in financial and related services in London."
Ctit Group,Goldman Needs to Revive Trading," Jul 19, 2017",1,"Goldman Sachs is starting to lose its Wall Street halo, and it isn't clear what the bank intends to do about it.

For a second consecutive quarter, the bank dramatically underperformed its peers in fixed income, currency and commodities trading. Revenue in this segment fell by 40% from a year earlier in the three months through June.

The main reason appears to be Goldman's large footprint in commodities. Volatility was particularly low for commodity prices in the second quarter, so analysts already expected Goldman to post a weak trading result.

Still, the contrast with other banks is striking. In the same quarter, Citigroup, Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase saw declines of 6% to 19% in comparable businesses.

Also for a second quarter in a row, Goldman acknowledged that poor execution in commodities trading played a role. ""We didn't navigate the market as well as we aspire to, or as well as we have in the past,"" Chief Financial Officer Martin Chavez said on a conference call. He added that it was Goldman's worst quarter in commodities since the company went public in 1999.

Universal banks such as Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase do more trading for corporate clients, providing a steady flow of business. Goldman specializes more in serving hedge funds and other active investors, meaning volumes can fall off more quickly when speculative appetite recedes.

However, when pressed by analysts on how Goldman might improve execution or customer mix, Mr. Chavez didn't offer anything concrete -- just vague assurances that Goldman is looking to fill in client gaps, serve existing clients better and learn from what has worked in other units such as equities.

Goldman still managed to beat analyst estimates for the quarter, thanks to a strong performance in its opaque investing and lending unit. This was largely due to big increases in the value of venture startups and other companies in which Goldman holds equity stakes. But the lack of transparency in this unit means investors can't count on this strong performance being repeated in future quarters.

Equities-trading revenue was strong in the second quarter, rising 17% from a year earlier. But other traditional areas of strength for Goldman such as equity underwriting and advising on mergers and acquisitions were weak.

Goldman's shares have been basically flat over the past three months, compared with a rise of around 6% in the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index. To catch up, Goldman needs to give investors a clearer picture how it can turn around what has typically been its most important business unit."
Ctit Group,FedEx Struggles After Cyberattack --- Petya significantly affects overseas operations of TNT Express business," Jul 18, 2017",0,"Customers waiting for packages abroad are experiencing significant delays as FedEx Corp. continues to reel from the effects of a June 27 cyberattack.

The delivery giant said Monday in a securities filing that the global cyberattack known as Petya significantly affected the operations of its TNT Express business, which has delivery operations in the Middle East and Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe and South America.

FedEx said while TNT depots, hubs and facilities are operational, it has resorted to manual processes to facilitate a significant portion of operations and customer service functions. The company said it couldn't estimate when TNT services would be fully restored.

FedEx said the cyberattack will likely have a material financial impact on its operations and that lower volumes at TNT have already dented revenue. FedEx doesn't have cyber insurance or any other insurance to cover the attack.

United Parcel Service Inc. and the U.S. Postal Service didn't immediately respond to questions Monday about whether they hold insurance policies to cover damage stemming from cyberattacks.

Many consumers have vented their frustrations on social media platforms about slow delivery times. On July 9, Twitter user @pieceofone complained about not receiving a package being delivered from China to Portugal. The tracking information began on June 24 with an estimated June 28 delivery date, but the user said he hadn't received the package or any further information from the company.

The Twitter user didn't immediately respond to interview requests. According to shipment tracking information through TNT's website, the package mentioned in the tweet arrived July 12. FedEx didn't immediately respond to comment about that customer's package delivery.

Last month's attack, which stemmed in part from an Ukrainian tax software product, hit a number of major global companies from Merck & Co. to PAO Rosneft. It also marks the second major cyberattack to hit FedEx this year.

In May, a large cyberattack known as WannaCry scrambled the company's computers. The courier said at the time it was experiencing interference with its Windows-based systems caused by malware. FedEx declined to say how widespread the problem was and whether deliveries were affected.

FedEx acquired TNT Express BV last year for $4.8 billion, the largest acquisition in FedEx's history as part of a move to accelerate its growth abroad.

The Dutch company contributed 12% to FedEx's top line in the prior fiscal year.

FedEx shares fell $3.58, or 1.6%, to $215.48 on Monday. The shares are up 16% year to date. The modest decline Monday is a rational response, Citigroup said in a research note.

Ctit Group,High Debt Loads Shake Retailers," Jul 18, 2017",1,"Corrections & Amplifications

Macy's Inc. laid out plans for a revamped marketing strategy on June 6. A Business & Finance article Tuesday about retailers' debt loads incorrectly said it did so two weeks ago.

(WSJ July 19, 2017)

Toys ""R"" Us Inc. will get a new website this summer as it struggles to compete online with cash-rich rivals. The toy retailer, laden with $5 billion in debt, has spent $100 million over the past several years to help boost its online sales.

That isn't likely to stop the toy chain from falling further behind its rivals. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. bought Jet.com last August for $3.3 billion and since then has purchased three more online retailers. Target Corp. is investing billions to lower prices and improve online sales.

Toys ""R"" Us is one of many retailers fighting to keep up. High debt loads, nervous lenders and falling sales make it impossible to invest enough to compete online. And when companies do generate online sales, the margins are so tight that future investments are harder to make.

Macy's Inc. had $5.5 billion in net debt at the end of the first quarter. A year ago, it said it would improve its performance and use the cash to pay down debt. Instead, the retailer struggled and had to use nearly two-thirds of its free cash flow last year to pay off $750 million in maturing debt. It bought back more this year, further hurting its ability to fund plans to revive sales, including improving its mobile app and expanding its off-price concept Backstage.

Worries that borrowing will become more expensive or won't be there at all have prompted some relatively healthy companies to focus on paying down their debt, which further limits the amount they can invest.

Retailers sold just four high-yield bonds this year worth $2.8 billion, compared with seven bonds worth $5.7 billion last year. That is down from a 20-year peak of 28 bonds totaling $10.7 billion in 2013, according to Dealogic. The amount of retail bank and bond debt rated by Moody's is up 65% since 2007.

Toys ""R"" Us and other struggling chains can likely survive for years, but they will struggle to catch up with the competition while still turning a profit. During holiday 2015, the toy retailer had to resort to ""sales prevention"" by halting some online deals after a deluge of web orders overwhelmed its ability to get products to customers in time for Christmas. The company had planned to launch its new website ahead of Christmas 2016 but was forced to delay it to fully test the new platform.

On a conference call with analysts June 15, Chief Executive David Brandon said a clunky online registry tool and the lack of a subscription feature for parents to receive regular shipments of diapers were holding back Toys ""R"" Us's baby business. ""It's just one of a number of examples where we're limited in terms of how we can compete until we transition over to our new website,"" Mr. Brandon said.

Meanwhile, Amazon.com Inc. sold about $4 billion of toys last year, more than one-third of what Toys ""R"" Us sells, according to analytics firm One Click Retail. Amazon's toy sales were up 24%, compared with 5% for the overall market and five years of declines for Toys ""R"" Us.

For large retail chains, one of the few levers left to pull are store closures. ""We're going to see indefinite top-line and gross-margin declines until there have been enough store closures,"" said Jenna Giannelli, a retail credit analyst at Citigroup.

Toys ""R"" Us, which was taken private in 2005 in a $6.6 billion leveraged buyout by Bain Capital, KKR & Co. and Vornado Realty Trust, has swapped debt coming due this year and next for longer-term debt with a higher interest rate. Analysts expect it to do the same with another $400 million bond due next year, but that could be tough. On June 20, S&P Global Ratings lowered its outlook for the retailer, saying that if markets are nervous or the company's business gets worse, it might not be able to pay off that bond when it comes due.

Toys ""R"" Us declined to comment.

Macy's has been forced to rethink its strategy in other ways. In March 2015, Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet said the company ""liked having control of our real estate."" That November, Macy's announced it was exploring joint ventures for its four flagship properties. In 2016, it sold its men's store in San Francisco's Union Square, reached an agreement to sell its downtown Minneapolis store and began work on a plan to shrink its store on Chicago's State Street to make way for a buyer or joint-venture partner.

When Macy's laid out plans two weeks ago for a revamped marketing strategy and greater focus on exclusive products, it warned its 2017 gross-margin rate could be weaker than it had expected in February. It cited excess inventory and bigger discounting in the beauty business."

Probe Results in

$246 Million Fine

French bank BNP Paribas SA agreed to pay $246 million to the Federal Reserve to resolve a probe of misconduct in its foreign-exchange business.

Traders at the French bank who buy and sell dollars and foreign currencies used electronic chat rooms to collude with rivals to manipulate FX prices and benchmark rates, the Fed said in a statement. It ordered BNP Paribas to improve its senior management oversight and controls relating to the firm's FX trading.

BNP Paribas, which also agreed to a $350 million settlement in May with New York's state banking regulator over the deficiencies, said it ""deeply regrets the past misconduct which was a clear breach of the high standards on which the group operates."" It added that it has improved its systems of control by increasing resources and staff dedicated to compliance, conducting staff training and launching a new code of conduct that applies to all staff.

BNP Paribas is the latest in a line of banks fined for its failure to stop traders from trying to manipulate foreign-exchange markets. Several global banks including Barclays PLC, Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. have together paid billions of dollars in fines in recent years.

BNP Paribas said the misconduct took place between 2007 and 2013. In January, the Fed banned former BNP Paribas trader Jason Katz, who pleaded guilty to violating federal antitrust laws, from working in the U.S. banking industry for his manipulation of FX prices. It also barred the French lender from re-employing individuals who were involved in the misconduct.

CHINA

People's Bank Sells

Foreign Exchange

China's central bank sold a net 34.32 billion yuan ($5.06 billion) of foreign currency in June, according to calculations made by The Wall Street Journal based on central-bank data released Monday.

The figure came in higher than a net foreign-exchange sale of 29.33 billion yuan in May, according to the latest data from the People's Bank of China. The central bank's total foreign-exchange purchase position stood at 21.515 trillion yuan at the end of June, down from 21.550 trillion yuan a month before, the PBOC said. The purchase position has been falling for 20 consecutive months, indicating continued capital-outflow pressure."
Ctit Group,U.S. News: 'Herculean' China Pact Yields Modest Improvements," Jul 17, 2017",1,"When Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced in May the ""herculean accomplishment"" of extracting Chinese promises to swiftly open long-restricted markets in finance and agriculture, he pronounced the actions ""more than has been done in the whole history of U.S.-China relations on trade.""

Now, with the two countries having marked the deadline Sunday for completing the agreements, affected American companies said Beijing met the letter of its pledges, yet fell short of the spirit. Their assessment: slow, modestly improved access in some sectors, while lingering obstacles in others will stymie foreign companies for years, even as specific targeted barriers have been removed.

""They've delivered on the promises by the date they've been required, but they could do more,"" said Jake Parker, vice president for the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents U.S. companies in China and has been monitoring the deals. While the changes ""indicate from the Chinese perspective that their market is open,"" Mr. Parker said, ""whether foreign companies can actually operate there is still unclear"" in some industries.

The success of those market-opening measures will be on the table when top economic officials from the two countries meet Wednesday to discuss trade and investment issues. Officials from both governments insist the pact has been successful.

""We hope to report further progress on. . .deliverables next week,"" a Commerce Department spokesman said Thursday, referring to actions taken under the May agreement.

""A number of 'early harvests' have been reaped,"" a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said Friday.

The May announcement was portrayed as an early down payment on a general April agreement between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to make progress toward reducing the $347 billion bilateral trade imbalance that Mr. Trump regularly complains about.

In return for China's promises, the U.S. offered a couple of market-opening gestures as well and, in compliance with the pact, has issued rules allowing previously blocked Chinese cooked-poultry imports.

The two presidents gave themselves 100 days to come up with a comprehensive plan. More commitments are expected at this week's meetings, timed to observe the 100-day mark of the U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue.

But difficulty showing quick, significant progress on even the early items targeted as low-hanging fruit indicates bigger challenges ahead in reshaping U.S.-China economic relations.

In the May pact, the Trump administration had marked five sectors -- electronic payments, credit-rating services, bond underwriting, beef and biotechnology -- where U.S. firms had long been frustrated by perceived Chinese regulatory barriers.

Chinese agencies have made the specific changes promised in the written agreement. One resulted in clear, complete compliance: Beijing granted licenses promised to Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. to expand their bond-market activities in China. In the other four, market gains seem limited or uncertain, business officials say.

Consider the yearslong battle by Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. to get banks in China to distribute credit cards that run on their networks to Chinese consumers. China committed in May to issue any further necessary guidelines allowing U.S. firms to begin the licensing process, a crucial step that had long been stalled. The Chinese fulfilled that commitment June 30. But while that was aimed at leading ""to full and prompt market access,"" according to a U.S. government press release, industry officials say it hasn't.

""All this does is allow companies to submit an application; it doesn't mean that a foreign card company can begin operating in the market,"" said Mr. Parker, who believes it still will be years before Chinese banks distribute many Visa- or Mastercard-branded cards that run on those networks in China. Among other barriers, he said, the new rules require companies to submit to a national security review, without laying out the details of that process, and require them to build data centers in China.

Visa and Mastercard representatives said they are reviewing the guidelines, without offering a timetable for submitting applications.

One triumph touted by the Trump administration has been the late-June opening of China's beef market, shut to the U.S. since a 2003 mad-cow scare. But the strictness of China's standards mean China likely will remain for now a niche market for the American beef industry."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Citigroup to Overhaul Premium Card," Jul 17, 2017",1,"The rewards war in the premium-card market isn't subsiding.

Citigroup Inc. is revamping some of the benefits on its Prestige card in an effort to sweeten the deal for coveted affluent consumers who exceed high spending thresholds.

The bank is expected to announce Monday that it will raise the sign-up bonus on the high-end card to 75,000 points from 40,000. It also is raising the minimum amount that card holders must spend in the first three months to earn the reward to $7,500 from $4,000. Both changes take effect July 23.

Points have become a valued currency for many consumers, especially in the travel sector where they can be redeemed for airfare and hotel stays. Premium cards geared at big spenders in particular have taken off because consumers who put most of their expenses on cards view them as a way to get discounts or free travel worth hundreds or thousands of dollars.

Citigroup's is the latest shot in an increasingly competitive market for high spenders. American Express Co. dominated the segment for decades, but that started to change in recent years. Citi jumped into the market in 2013 with Prestige, and competition intensified last summer when J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. launched the Sapphire Reserve card.

""The market has many options, though, with these annual fees, many eligible consumers will not be taking multiple cards,"" said Brian Riley, director of the credit advisory service at Mercator Advisory GroupInc. He said he expects other lenders to quickly react to Citi's latest changes.

The bank's executives, led by Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat, are making the credit-card moves as the overall business becomes more important to the company.

Citigroup's revenue for the second quarter beat analysts' expectations, rising 2% from a year prior, helped in part by credit cards. Revenue for Citi-branded North America cards increased 10% to $2.1 billion, though the bank's credit costs continue to rise as it expands its card portfolio.

Citigroup is also beefing up the Prestige card's hotel benefit. Under the changes, Citi will allow card holders to get their fourth night in a hotel free, regardless of whether they paid for the first three with dollars or points. The sign-up bonus for Prestige, which carries a $450 annual fee, doesn't rival the 100,000 points that J.P. Morgan used to offer on the Sapphire Reserve card in exchange for spending $4,000 in the first three months. That came to an end in March."
Ctit Group,"Billionaires Build An Uneasy Partnership --- Bill Gates, Prince al-Waleed feuded after buying Four Seasons Hotels"," Jul 17, 2017",1,"A decade ago, two of the world's wealthiest men came together to buy Four Seasons Holdings Inc., home to some of the most expensive lodging around.

The deal was surprising both for its lofty price tag, $3.8 billion, and for the unusual partnership, involving tech titan Bill Gates and Saudi Prince al-Waleed bin Talal.

The financial crisis soon pummeled the luxury-hotel business. The partners then took to feuding, about matters ranging from helping fund new hotel developments to who should be chief executive. After a truce in 2013, they have been trying to whip their investment into shape.

It has been no slam dunk, falling short of ambitious targets for new hotel developments. At the same time, the focus on fast growth has been causing some business partners and industry analysts to question whether standards and brand appeal can be maintained as Four Seasons hotels become more numerous.

In buying Four Seasons, Mr. Gates and Prince al-Waleed were at the forefront of an investment trend. The superrich, often through structures called family offices, increasingly have been teaming up to acquire whole companies, planning to keep them long term.

Family offices hold more than $4 trillion in assets, approaching the total invested in hedge funds and private-equity funds combined. The wealthy clans sometimes invest together because they consider themselves like-minded in being long-term investors. That doesn't guarantee an easy partnership, however, as evidenced in this deal, as it was described by former executives, current and former board members, business partners and industry observers familiar with events at Four Seasons.

The first Four Seasons was a motor lodge in a rundown part of Toronto, opened in 1961 by Isadore Sharp, a son of Polish immigrants to Canada. By the time he began looking to sell the publicly traded company in 2006, Four Seasons was a renowned name in lodging, known for personalized service and top-of-the-line amenities.

Rather than owning its hotels, Four Seasons forms partnerships with investors and developers, then keeps tight control by managing the properties. Four Seasons hotel owners include billionaires such as Oracle Corp. founder Larry Ellison and Beanie Baby mogul Ty Warner.

By 2006, Prince al-Waleed's investment firm, Kingdom Holding Co., already owned about 25% of Four Seasons stock as well as several hotels. Mr. Sharp consulted him about his sale plans. Prince al-Waleed recommended bringing in Mr. Gates's investment firm, Cascade Investment LLC, which also owned some Four Seasons shares.

The three men agreed to a deal in which Cascade and Kingdom would each own 47.5% of the company, while Mr. Sharp would have the other 5% and remain chief executive for five years.

The sale closed in early 2007, near the peak of the real-estate boom. The price, 47 times one measure of earnings, reflected the era's optimism, as well as projections that Four Seasons would continue to expand at an increasingly rapid pace.

""From a valuation perspective, they were seen as having paid a lot of money,"" said Jonathan Stanner, former CEO of Strategic Hotels & Resorts Inc., who partnered with Four Seasons to build hotels. ""But people reasoned that as long-term investors they could justify the high price.""

The purchase brought together family investment firms with quite-different cultures. Cascade is run by Michael Larson, a low-profile money manager with a brusque manner and penchant for the color pink. Mr. Gates rarely gets involved. Cascade doesn't have a website and provides scant details of its investments.

Kingdom welcomes publicity, putting out press releases, photos and video clips documenting Prince al-Waleed's meetings. The prince shot to prominence in 1991 after buying a stake in a predecessor to Citigroup Inc. Forbes confirms that he once accused the magazine of understating his wealth in its annual ranking of the richest people.

Mr. Sharp, in an autobiography, told of being hosted by Prince al-Waleed on his 288-foot yacht in the south of France and joining the prince on the slopes at Jackson Hole, Wyo. Cascade executives, in their work, didn't share this taste for the high life. When the Four Seasons board met one year at the George V in Paris, a luxury hotel owned by Kingdom, some Cascade employees stayed in more modest accommodations.

Kingdom, which had bought much of its Four Seasons stake in 1994 for less than the 2007 deal price, was happy to let Mr. Sharp continue to run the show. Cascade had paid a premium price, based partly on rosy growth projections from Mr. Sharp's bankers. The bankers said the company could more than double its number of hotels in a decade, to 160.

The 2008 financial crisis left that plan in tatters, as both hotel developers and luxury-minded travelers cut back. ""One can only imagine Cascade felt it had been bamboozled,"" said Laurence Geller, an investor who has in the past owned numerous Four Seasons hotels and now owns a property from a rival brand. ""What was said was not reality.""

Kingdom marked down the value of its Four Seasons holding every year between 2008 and 2012, according to annual reports it publishes because a small portion of Kingdom trades in Riyadh. The value recovered slightly in the next two years but was still below the 2008 value as recently as 2014, the most recent available data. Cascade doesn't disclose how it values its Four Seasons stake.

Sarmad Zok, the chief executive of Kingdom's hotel business, said both investors are happy with their partnership and the performance of their investment.

As occupancy rates fell in the recession, some hotel owners pushed Four Seasons for cost cuts, from scrapping huge displays of fresh flowers to outsourcing laundry.

At one meeting, Cascade executives argued that to save money at a Cascade-owned Four Seasons in Whistler, British Columbia, they should stop replacing guests' sheets every day unless requested. Mr. Larson's view was that wealthy travelers were also environmentally conscious. Mr. Sharp disagreed, saying guests paying as much as $700 a night should have their sheets washed daily, according to people familiar with the meeting. In a compromise, guests were given the option of placing a pine cone on their sheets if they didn't need them washed every day.

Mr. Sharp said he didn't recall those conversations with Cascade.

Mr. Sharp stepped down as CEO in 2010 but set the condition that he should be succeeded by his protege, company president Kathleen Taylor, who then took over. Cascade executives would have preferred an outside candidate because they felt that Ms. Taylor didn't represent enough of a break with the past and wouldn't engineer the rapid expansion they were counting on, according to people familiar with the company.

Kingdom executives were supportive of Ms. Taylor, which surprised some Cascade executives who thought that their partners felt the same.

During Ms. Taylor's tenure, the rift became a distraction. The board found it hard to approve capital commitments needed to win over investors in new hotels. Cascade executives sometimes withheld their support to signal they wouldn't put capital behind a chief executive they didn't support, those familiar with the company said.

After months of tension, top executives from Cascade and Kingdom met to settle the matter, gathering in early February 2013 at London's Savoy hotel. Joining were Mr. Gates and Prince al-Waleed, in one of the few times the two billionaires sat down to discuss their investment.

The meeting ended with a decision to replace Ms. Taylor. ""It was time to make a change,"" said Mr. Sharp, who drew the job of dismissing her. ""It was my role to take the responsibility,"" said the founder, now 85. Ms. Taylor declined to comment.

With this dispute over, Cascade and Kingdom sought to put aside their remaining disagreements and push growth and profitability, moving swiftly to make up for the years lost to the recession and its aftermath. Cascade's hotel specialist, Randy Jack, and Kingdom's Mr. Zok led the search for Ms. Taylor's successor and picked Allen Smith, a veteran of real-estate investing. Messrs. Jack and Zok became more active in running Four Seasons, discussing the business regularly and together courting potential new hotel developers.

Some differences persisted. A few months after the truce, Prince al-Waleed said publicly he favored an initial public offering of Four Seasons within a couple of years. Cascade appeared to disagree, releasing a brief statement saying it was ""in for the long term.""

""There are times when we have a divergence of vision, and when that happens, we have a discussion and the best idea prevails,"" said Mr. Zok.

Hotel analysts say Four Seasons has been growing faster than most other five-star brands, at a time when the luxury market is enjoying a boom. In the U.S., luxury room rates and occupancy levels are at or near their highest levels ever, according to industry data tracker STR Inc.

Still, Four Seasons is falling somewhat short of its internal goals, even after revising them downward after the recession. In 2013, the company set a target for 120 hotels by end of this year, according to a person familiar with the matter. It now has 105 properties in operation, with more than 50 under development or in the planning stage. A Four Seasons spokeswoman said the company hopes to get to 108 properties by the end of 2017.

Four Seasons has grown partly by defying industry conventions. In New Orleans it plans a 330-room hotel, even though many say luxury service suffers when hotels build much more than 200 rooms.

The company is comfortable with a larger property in New Orleans because the city is ""supply starved with luxury product,"" said Mr. Smith, the CEO. He said Four Seasons has quite a few other hotels with over 300 rooms, and ""the reviews in terms of service levels remain exceptionally high.""

Four Seasons also has sometimes opened a second hotel in a city, such as New York and Boston. Traditionally, it avoided doubling up for fear of angering an existing owner. Mr. Smith said the company pursues the strategy ""judiciously"" and ""with sensitivity to the owners involved.""

It has become more ambitious globally, opening hotels in emerging markets. The company recently expanded its board to include younger representatives as it tries to woo millennials and engage guests using technology and apps.

Some new Four Seasons properties, such as a 77-room hotel in Miami Beach, have opened to strong reviews. Nadim Ashi, whose investment firm owns the property, said room rates are averaging $1,000 a night.

Four Seasons decentralized some functions last year after listening to some hotel owners' complaints. They no longer have to buy supplies such as light fixtures from the company, giving them more control of costs.

Some of the changes risk Four Seasons' reputation, said Piers Schmidt, founder of Luxury Branding, a U.K. consultancy. In a survey his firm did in 2015, based on analysis of hotel reviews on travel website TripAdvisor, Four Seasons ranked 13th. Other surveys rank Four Seasons higher; a 2017 J.D. Power study about North American hotel guest satisfaction that was just released) ranked Four Seasons third in the luxury segment, behind JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton.

Mr. Schmidt said luxury brands that expand rapidly risk diluting their culture by hiring staff too quickly or promoting managers too fast, and ""I do believe that's the case with Four Seasons.""

Four Seasons spokeswoman Sarah Tuite called the results from Luxury Branding's study ""inconsistent with what we see in multiple third-party tracking sources.""

Four Seasons has seen an exodus of veteran executives in recent years. Mr. Smith said that ""invariably, changes ensue"" when a company shifts from founder-led to a more corporate structure.

A rapid expansion of this sort raises a different concern to Ellis O'Connor, co-head of MSD Hospitality, a unit of Michael Dell's family office that owns two Four Seasons hotels. ""With luxury hotel operation, scarcity is part of the allure,"" Mr. O'Connor said. ""You can't turn it into a commodity and get above-market rates.""

People familiar with the Four Seasons operation said Cascade and Kingdom appear determined not to weaken the chain as it grows, and have broken off 14 partnerships with owners whose properties weren't up to standard.

That is a ""clear indication we are striking an appropriate balance between growing the brand and actively managing the quality of our portfolio,"" Mr. Smith said. ""We will never compromise quality for the sake of growth."""
Ctit Group,Banks Get Rousing Wake-Up Call," Jul 15, 2017",0,"When the industry leader hits sudden headwinds, it can be bad news for the whole sector.

Bank stocks, which have rallied in recent weeks, ran out of gas on Friday. J.P. Morgan Chase's downgraded expectations explain why.

The bank reported earnings on Friday, along with rivals Citigroup and Wells Fargo. All three beat analyst expectations for earnings, but their stocks fell.

J.P. Morgan said it now expects net interest income to rise by about $4 billion this year, down from its earlier expectation of $4.5 billion, on slower loan growth and a decline in long-term interest rates during the second quarter.

J.P. Morgan's strong loan growth has stood out in recent quarters, even as lending has slowed nationwide. But in the second quarter, its total loans were up just 4% from a year earlier, compared with 6% in the first quarter and 7% for all of last year. Others are feeling the impact even more strongly. Total average loans at Wells Fargo were up just 1% from a year earlier, compared with 4% in the first quarter.

Bankers across the country have said that businesses are hesitant to take out big loans, partly due to uncertainty about policy action in Washington. This could help explain why J.P. Morgan Chase Chief Executive James Dimon showed his frustration with the state of public policy in the U.S. by cursing on Friday's conference call with analysts.

While the Federal Reserve's rate increases help banks earn more on their loans, part of this benefit is lost when long-term rates decline. That is what happened for most of the second quarter. There was some hope recently as yields jumped on 10-year Treasurys. But that reversed Friday when the yield fell following weak economic data.

The fundamental direction for J.P. Morgan and its peers remains positive. The economy is healthy, and they were just granted permission by the Fed to boost their payouts to investors. If the Fed follows through with plans to keep raising rates and start shrinking its balance sheet later this year, the rate environment will improve further.

But bank shares are also no longer cheap. J.P. Morgan is trading at 1.4 times book value, compared with just one times book a year ago. After a move like that, banks need to justify higher valuations with better growth. Any disappointment can hit shares hard."
Ctit Group,"Banks' Results Raise Red Flags --- Earnings climb at three big lenders, but concerns over lending growth hurt shares"," Jul 15, 2017",1,"A still-challenging environment around lending and interest rates, along with frustration voiced over Washington gridlock, took some of the shine off otherwise solid financial results from three of the biggest U.S. banks.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the biggest U.S. bank by assets, led the way with record profit in the second quarter of $7.03 billion. Even so, executives on Friday cut their projections for lending growth in 2017 as well as for interest income. Shares in the bank and other lenders fell in response, reflecting investors' worries that economic growth might not be strong enough to fuel further gains in bank shares given their postelection run-up.

The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index is up about 28% since last November's election, nearly double the performance of the S&P 500 during that time.

On Friday, shares of J.P. Morgan dropped 0.9%, while shares in the other two big banks that reported results, Wells Fargo & Co. and Citigroup Inc., fell 1.1% and 0.5%, respectively.

Investors' excitement over policy changes that could benefit banks has also cooled amid uncertainty around issues such as a tax-code overhaul or infrastructure spending. Frustration on that front was expressed by J.P. Morgan CEO James Dimon, who challenged Washington to do more to boost the economy.

In doing so, he struck a tone more downbeat than the hopeful one many bankers adopted after President Donald Trump's election. ""It's just unfortunate, but it's hurting us, it's hurting the body politic, it's hurting the average American,"" Mr. Dimon said of Washington inaction. ""We have become one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet. It's almost an embarrassment to be an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid shit we have to deal with in this country.

""We have to get our act together,"" he added.

Mr. Dimon's remarks came shortly after the bank said it expected to increase its net interest income by $4 billion this year, down from an earlier projection of $4.5 billion. A big driver of the reduction has been persistent low yields on longer-term bonds, which reflects skepticism about long-term prospects for economic growth and inflation.

Long-term yields are moribund despite four increases in short-term rates by the Federal Reserve since late 2015. That combination weighs on bank profits because it narrows the difference between short- and long-term rates -- a flattening of the yield curve, which is often seen as a negative sign for economic growth.

Despite such factors, second-quarter results from J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. beat Wall Street expectations."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp;amp; Markets: Citigroup Revenue Beats Estimates," Jul 15, 2017",1,"A softer-than-expected decline in trading revenue helped Citigroup Inc. defy Wall Street expectations and grow quarterly revenue by 2% from a year ago.

After a late-June uptick in trading activity around global interest rates, revenue was $17.901 billion, beating forecasts of a decline from the $17.548 billion a year ago. Analysts had anticipated a drop to $17.4 billion.

Still, quarterly profit at the New York-based bank was $3.872 billion, down 3% from $3.998 billion a year earlier, thanks in part to the overall trading decline during the quarter and higher costs associated with credit cards.

Citigroup's per-share earnings rose to $1.28 from $1.24 a year ago as the bank continued to buy back shares at a fast pace. Analysts, on average, had expected $1.21 a share.

Like its rival J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., which also reported earnings Friday, Citigroup's trading desk this quarter suffered from continuing low volatility and a lack of new catalysts in the form of unexpected central-bank rate moves or a pickup in economic activity.

However, the drop-off wasn't nearly as sharp as anticipated, or as sharp as J.P. Morgan's.

Citigroup's second-quarter trading revenue fell 7% to $3.906 billion from $4.208 billion a year ago. Last month, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach predicted trading revenue would be down by 12% to 13% from a year ago.

Late June saw a jump in trading in the interest rates of the Group of 10 leading industrial nations after the Federal Reserve's rate increase, and after discussions of possible additional stimulus by the U.K. and European central banks, Citigroup said.

Fixed-income trading was off by 6% from a year ago, while equities trading dropped by 11%.

The decline halted momentum in Citigroup's relatively undersized stock-trading business, in which the bank has been investing heavily to bring it more in-line with rivals.

Citigroup, meanwhile, reported a surge in investment-banking revenue as it stole share from rivals in the business of advising companies on mergers and underwriting stock and bond offerings. The unit was up 22% from a year ago to $1.486 billion, the biggest quarterly haul in seven years."
Ctit Group,Why the Post Office Gives Amazon Special Delivery," Jul 14, 2017",1,"In my neighborhood, I frequently walk past ""shop local"" signs in the windows of struggling stores. Yet I don't feel guilty ordering most of my family's household goods on Amazon. In a world of fair competition, there will be winners and losers.

But when a mail truck pulls up filled to the top with Amazon boxes for my neighbors and me, I do feel some guilt. Like many close observers of the shipping business, I know a secret about the federal government's relationship with Amazon: The U.S. Postal Service delivers the company's boxes well below its own costs. Like an accelerant added to a fire, this subsidy is speeding up the collapse of traditional retailers in the U.S. and providing an unfair advantage for Amazon.

This arrangement is an underappreciated accident of history. The post office has long had a legal monopoly to deliver first-class mail, or nonurgent letters. The exclusivity comes with a universal-service obligation -- to provide for all Americans at uniform price and quality. This communication service helps knit this vast country together, and it's the why the Postal Service exists.

In 2001 the quantity of first-class mail in the U.S. began to decline thanks to the internet. Today it is down 40% from its peak levels, according to Postal Service data. But though there are fewer letters to put into each mailbox, the Postal Service still visits 150 million residences and businesses daily. With less traditional mail to deliver, the service has filled its spare capacity by delivering more boxes.

Other companies, such as UPS and FedEx, compete with the Postal Service to deliver packages. Lawmakers, to their credit, wanted a level playing field between the post office and its private competitors. The 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act made it illegal for the Postal Service to price parcel delivery below its cost.

But with a networked business using shared buildings and employees, calculating cost can be devilishly subjective. When our postal worker delivers 10 letters and one box to our home, how should we allocate the cost of her time, her truck, and the sorting network and systems that support her? What if the letter-to-box ratio changes?

In 2007 the Postal Service and its regulator determined that, at a minimum, 5.5% of the agency's fixed costs must be allocated to packages and similar products. A decade later, around 25% of its revenue comes from packages, but their share of fixed costs has not kept pace. First-class mail effectively subsidizes the national network, and the packages get a free ride. An April analysis from Citigroup estimates that if costs were fairly allocated, on average parcels would cost $1.46 more to deliver. It is as if every Amazon box comes with a dollar or two stapled to the packing slip -- a gift card from Uncle Sam.

Amazon is big enough to take full advantage of ""postal injection,"" and that has tipped the scales in the internet giant's favor. Select high-volume shippers are able to drop off presorted packages at the local Postal Service depot for ""last mile"" delivery at cut-rate prices. With high volumes and warehouses near the local depots, Amazon enjoys low rates unavailable to its competitors. My analysis of available data suggests that around two-thirds of Amazon's domestic deliveries are made by the Postal Service. It's as if Amazon gets a subsidized space on every mail truck.

I do not know which stores in my neighborhood will be gone five years from now, but I am certain my household will continue to receive numerous boxes from Amazon. I also believe that society would be better off if competing retailers, online or brick-and-mortar, continue to thrive. Congress should demand the enforcement of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, and the Postal Service needs to stop picking winners and losers in the retail world. The federal government has had its thumb on the competitive scale for far too long."
Ctit Group,Roku Aims For IPO This Year," Jul 14, 2017",1,"Roku Inc., which makes streaming-media devices and software, is preparing an initial public offering it expects to launch before year-end, according to people familiar with the company's plans.

The Los Gatos, Calif., company recently hired Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc. and Allen & Co. as underwriters on the IPO, these people said. The company could file confidentially in the next few weeks, one of the people said.

Roku is seeking a valuation of roughly $1 billion, a person with knowledge of the company's plans said. It isn't clear whether Roku can achieve that number, though, and troubles with two offerings this year -- Blue Apron Holdings Inc. and Snap Inc. -- mean determining the right valuation likely will be difficult in the coming months, buyers and sellers of IPOs say.

Roku has spent much of the past two years transforming its business from one that generated revenue largely from hardware to one that gets a more significant portion of its top line from ads on its streaming services featuring content from Hulu, Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube, as well as from revenue-sharing deals with these companies.

Roku and its underwriters will likely seek to pitch it as the future of television and a firm that can capture significant market share -- and revenue -- as more content moves off traditional networks and more consumers shift away from traditional cable.

In 2016, Roku generated nearly $400 million in revenue, and its media and licensing segment accounted for more than a quarter of that, according to the company.

As of June 30, Roku said it had 15 million monthly active accounts, which was a 61% rise from the same time a year earlier.

Roku originally worked with banks on a possible IPO in 2014, but at the time, it would have gone public as a hardware company and it was moving toward generating more revenue from its streaming-related services. The company expects that the market will now give it more credit for its new mix of revenue, people familiar with the company's thinking said.

21st Century Fox Inc., which shares common ownership with Wall Street Journal owner News Corp, is an investor in Roku. Roku also counts Sky PLC, Hearst Corp., Fidelity Investments, Menlo Ventures and Globespan Capital Partners as investors."
Ctit Group,Past Flop May Help Big Tobacco," Jul 13, 2017",1,"What consumer good offers the best growth potential? It could be one in long-term decline: the cigarette. Some stock-market valuations have yet to catch on.

As unit sales have fallen in the U.S. and other rich countries, manufacturers have generated profit growth by ramping up prices and -- helped by marketing bans -- trimming costs. Meanwhile, spending on smokes in developing countries has risen. This formula has yielded huge gains for tobacco investors in recent years.

Now there is an added source of growth: cigarette substitutes. The popularity of heat-not-burn products in Japan has transformed the most recent quarterly results of Philip Morris International.

Unlike vaping products popular in the U.S. and U.K., heat-not-burn cigarettes contain tobacco and generate a ""throat hit"" similar to traditional varieties. But instead of being lit with a flame, they are heated by a sleek holder to generate a nicotine-laden inhalation.

Heat-not-burn technology was a costly flop when pioneered in the 1980s by Reynolds, yet it sowed a seed that under Reynolds's rival Philip Morris has grown into a credible product: IQOS. Released in Japan in 2014, IQOS accounted for 7% of cigarettes sold in the country in the first quarter.

Crucially, PMI gains even if IQOS replaces Marlboro, because heat-not-burn smokes are more lightly taxed than conventional cigarettes in most countries. Citigroup estimates that a pack of IQOS generates 30% more revenue for PMI in Japan than a pack of Marlboros, even at similar prices.

The brokerage is penciling in 8% organic sales growth at PMI this year, at least double what can be expected at consumer-products groups. They earn higher margins than vaping products.

Buying PMI stock is the obvious way to play this theme. A smarter bet could be London-listed British American Tobacco. BAT's valuation gap to PMI is near its widest in at least a decade; investors are excited about IQOS but give BAT no credit for its challenger product, glo. BAT's lower margins also suggest potential for cost cutting, particularly given its merger with Reynolds, due to complete later this year.

Buying PMI stock at 23 times prospective earnings amounts to an uncertain wager that IQOS finds converts beyond Japan. Japan's consumer culture can be insular, and smokers in the country like lighter menthol cigarettes, for which IQOS is a good substitute. It may be harder to win over those used to stronger smokes.

At less than 18 times earnings, well below not just PMI but also consumer-goods peers, BAT stock should prove a safe investment -- whether or not heat-not-burn lives up to its early promise."
Ctit Group,The Favorites to Win in Second-Quarter Bank Earnings," Jul 13, 2017",0,"Following the recent rally in bank stocks, the coming earnings season offers an opportunity to sort out who can keep rising, and who is due for a pause.

Higher interest rates and higher capital payouts have boosted bank shares across the board. From the end of May through Tuesday, the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index had risen 8.5%. But other aspects of the banking business have been less positive. Loan growth, trading volumes and mergers and acquisition activity were all tepid in the second quarter.

J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial will kick off second-quarter earnings on Friday, with other major financial firms reporting next week. The big universal banks look better positioned than both regional lenders and Wall Street brokers.

The lending slowdown that began late last year hasn't abated. At the end of June, total loans and leases by commercial banks in the U.S. were up just 3.3% from a year earlier, compared with 6.4% for all of 2016, according to Federal Reserve data. Commercial and industrial loans were up just 1.9% at the end of June. In the first quarter, this trend hit regional banks hardest, along with Wells Fargo, whose business profile is similar to a regional lender.

Executives at multiple banks also publicly warned during the quarter that trading volumes were down around 15% from a year earlier. A late-quarter bump up in rates could boost profits in the second or, more likely, third quarter for big universal banks with strong footprints in so-called macro products like interest rates and currencies, says UBS analyst Brennan Hawken. In the U.S., that would be J.P. Morgan and Citigroup.

Goldman Sachs's trading results could disappoint yet again because of its large exposure to commodities, Mr. Hawken notes. Last quarter, its trading revenue was basically flat, compared with double-digit increases for its rivals. Among other factors, Goldman blamed low oil-market volatility.

Unfortunately for Goldman, this continued in the second quarter. The firm's own analysts said recently that commodity volatility was down by around one-third in the second quarter.

Goldman and Morgan Stanley are most exposed to weak M&A. Total world-wide revenue from realized M&A deals was down 9.2% from last year's second quarter, according to Dealogic.

Rising interest rates and more flexibility to pay out capital are powerful levers that could keep pushing the whole sector higher. The biggest gains, though, will likely come from the biggest banks."
Ctit Group,Trump to Appoint Fed Bank Regulator," Jul 11, 2017",1,"WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump plans to put his first mark on the Federal Reserve by nominating Randal Quarles, an investment-fund manager and former Republican Treasury official, to be the central bank's top official in charge of regulating big banks.

The choice of Mr. Quarles, expected for months and confirmed by a White House official Monday, would put a more industry-friendly voice in perhaps the most powerful U.S. bank-regulatory post: Fed vice chair of supervision.

That job was created by Congress in 2010 and was never filled during the Obama administration, although former Fed governor Daniel Tarullo filled the role de facto. If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Quarles would take a lead role in carrying out the Trump administration's goal of rethinking many financial regulations adopted during the Obama era.

Mr. Quarles would also weigh in on monetary policy as one of seven members of the Fed's board of governors, now short-staffed with only four members. His views in that sphere could put him at odds with his new colleagues, notably because he has criticized the Fed's policy of keeping interest rates near zero for years following the financial crisis, and advocated for a monetary-policy rule, or formula, to guide rate decisions.

The Fed board has three vacancies, and the White House hopes to offer two more nominees as soon as possible, the official said. The administration has also begun the search for the next Fed chairman, though Mr. Trump hasn't ruled out nominating Chairwoman Janet Yellen to a second term, to begin when her current term expires in February.

Mr. Quarles has donated to Republican candidates for years and served in the Treasury Department in both Bush administrations, working on both international affairs and as undersecretary for domestic finance, a senior job that involves coordination with the many U.S. agencies that oversee the financial sector.

He left the government in 2006 and was a managing director at the Carlyle Group private-equity firm, investing in troubled banks. He is now managing director at Cynosure Group, a Utah investment firm.

Mr. Quarles, in a March 2016 Wall Street Journal op-ed that he co-wrote, said he didn't support ""arbitrarily taking an ax to big banks and irreparably damaging the economy."" He endorsed a review of postcrisis regulations but warned that ""the consequence of a dramatic increase in bank capital is an increase in the cost of bank credit.""

Analysts and government officials have said nominating Mr. Quarles, an establishment Republican, would be a sign that the White House favors more incremental rather than radical changes to the Fed, an institution that has long engendered mistrust among the economic nationalists who backed Mr. Trump during his campaign last year.

Mr. Trump's team has advocated a rethink of Wall Street rules but has few officials in place at financial regulatory agencies. If confirmed, Mr. Quarles would immediately take over the job of overseeing the Fed's regulatory staff, which supervises some of the largest U.S. financial firms including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc.

He could push for changes in the way the Fed oversees those firms, but he couldn't change the rules on his own. For that, he would need the support of other members of the Fed's board and other agencies.

The choice of Mr. Quarles ""shows that we're looking for a change to the heavy-handed approach to regulation from the prior administration,"" the White House official said Monday. Mr. Quarles, the official said, ""has a track record of working well with others to implement public policy.""

Obama administration officials have said stricter curbs on financial risk-taking were warranted in the wake of the financial crisis.

Mr. Quarles would find some familiar faces at the Fed. He has worked before with Fed governor Jerome Powell, who is now the point person on the Fed's regulatory efforts and also served in the George H.W. Bush administration and worked at Carlyle Group.

Mr. Quarles is married to Hope Eccles, who is a relative of Marriner Eccles, the New Deal-era Fed chairman whose name is on the building where Mr. Quarles would have his office.

Ms. Yellen is set to testify on Wednesday and Thursday on Capitol Hill, where she will likely be asked about Mr. Quarles and the Fed's agenda. In the past, she has said she is open to changing some bank rules but not what she regards as core changes adopted after the 2008 financial bailouts.

Ms. Yellen has objected to proposals to require the Fed to use a mathematical monetary-policy rule, an approach popular among some conservatives who argue central banks have too much discretion and should be more accountable to the public.

Mr. Quarles said in the 2016 op-ed that low-interest-rate policies have ""led to a rise in speculative positions"" across the financial system and that a monetary-policy rule would reduce the incentive for big banks and smaller firms to take dangerous risks.

Mr. Quarles's path to the nomination illustrates a broader trend in which nominees across the executive branch have faced delays completing the traditional background clearance and screening process.

Top White House officials had identified the vice chair post as a priority weeks after Mr. Trump's election last year, and after an extended search process, officials identified Mr. Quarles as their top pick in April. At the time, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had indicated a nominee for the post was imminent.

The White House expected Mr. Quarles's nomination to receive broad Republican support. He needs a simple majority to be approved by the Senate, where Republicans control 52 out of 100 seats.

The White House has also been considering economist Marvin Goodfriend to fill a second vacancy on the Fed board, according to people familiar with the situation. It isn't clear when his nomination might be announced and submitted to the Senate.

Ctit Group,"For Phones, an ATM Role --- Fingerprints stored on mobile devices give users access to cash; limiting hack dangers"," Jul 10, 2017",0,"In 2015, Citigroup Inc. began testing an ATM that would scan a customer's iris and make four-digit access codes obsolete. Two years on, Citi has shelved the project.

Among the reasons: the cost and complexity of collecting and managing millions of customers' biometric data. A large database of biometric data is also a particularly juicy target for hackers.

""If I steal your password, you make a new password,"" said George Avetisov, chief executive of HYPR Corp., a banking-technology startup. ""But how do you make a new fingerprint?""

Perhaps as a response to that issue, banks are taking a different tack on collecting biometric data. They aim to use the information to replace personal-identification numbers and passwords but are relying on customers to store and safeguard it themselves -- via their own smartphones.

Over the past year, lenders such as Wells Fargo & Co., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. have started to roll out automated teller machines that can link to customers' mobile devices. Customers will sign in through their phones, potentially using a fingerprint, and transmit a code to the ATM.

Though this adds a step to the identification process, customers are nonetheless eager to ditch the numerous PINs and passwords needed for transactions. Mobile phones are also one device on which biometrics has worked, as about two billion units globally can use fingerprints, pictures of eyes and faces, and voice recognition, according to HYPR. Those tools are already widely used for signing in to mobile-banking applications.

Citigroup's apps, for example, use voice, face and fingerprint recognition, although the bank has yet to roll out cardless ATMs. As for the iris-reading ATMs, Citigroup has ""reasons ranging from logistical to operational"" for not pursuing them at this time, a spokesman said.

Other banks have shared similar difficulties with how to approach biometric data. A survey by the U.K.'s University of Oxford and Mastercard Inc. published in June found that while nine out of 10 bankers wanted to take advantage of biometrics, only about a third reported a good experience so far using the technology.

An added complication is that, unlike some other countries, the U.S. doesn't have national identification databases. In countries such as Chile, which does have such a database, banks could tap into it to enable customers to sign into an ATM with a fingerprint. So, banks in the U.S. are on their own to figure out how to record and store customers' biometric markers. That process adds complexity and cost.

The need for next-generation ATMs is urgent. For one, card fraud is rising despite new security measures such as chip-enabled cards. Fair Isaac Corp., a credit-data provider, has said it detected a 70% uptick in compromised cards being used at ATMs and merchants in 2016.

Though ATMs -- introduced 50 years ago -- might seem quaint in the mobile age, their usage remains strong. Last year, J.P. Morgan increased the number of ATMs it owns by 4%, even as it closed 3% of its branches. In January, Citigroup nearly doubled the size of its ATM network with a deal to add 30,000 locations at retailers.

In their quest to use smartphones for biometrics, banks are relying on processes that are already well established. A customer using a phone at an ATM would authenticate her identify, using, say, a fingerprint as is the case with Apple Inc.'s iPhone and Apple Pay.

The phone would then create a digital token and transmit that to the ATM. That would validate the transaction without revealing any underlying biometric data to the bank. That means banks wouldn't have to protect treasure troves of genetic templates from hackers. This is because the biometric data would be stored on individual devices, not in a central location.

""With tokens, there's no use in attacking the bank server,"" said HYPR's Mr. Avetisov. Such digital tokens are widely used in mobile-payment applications and they are also generated by the chips now embedded in most credit cards."
Ctit Group,"Seeking Partner, Dish Cozies Up With Amazon"," Jul 7, 2017",1,"For years Dish Network Corp. Chief Executive Charlie Ergen has sought out deals and partnerships with just about every major telecom company, from Sprint Corp. to T-Mobile US Inc. to AT&T Inc., but to no avail.

Now, the satellite-television mogul is turning his attention to the technology world, and a new -- and somewhat surprising -- potential partner has emerged: Amazon.com Inc. CEO Jeff Bezos.

The two men -- eccentric billionaires with geek tendencies and shared interest in space and robotics -- have gotten to know each other better over the past year and have discussed a partnership to enter the wireless business, according to people familiar with the matter.

Among the possibilities: Amazon could help finance a network Dish is building focused on the ""Internet of Things"" -- the idea that everything from bikes to delivery drones can have web connectivity everywhere. Another idea is that Amazon, as a founding partner of Dish's new wireless network, could invite Prime members to pay a little more a month for a connectivity or phone plan, one of the people said.

No deal is imminent and it is unclear if the companies will move forward with a partnership. Dish has discussed versions of the ""founding partner"" concept with other technology firms, one of the people familiar with the matter said.

Amazon ""is taking a walk versus a run approach with Dish,"" adds one person familiar with the talks. An all-out acquisition of Dish by Amazon is highly unlikely, the people say. Amazon and Dish declined to comment.

The possibility of an Amazon-Dish tie-up comes amid a swirl of deal and partnership talks in the wireless industry. Cable companies, tech giants and the incumbent telecom carriers are all trying to position themselves, as smartphones and the mobile web capture more of consumers' attention, and as Washington regulators engender both new opportunities and obstacles.

Sprint was holding merger talks with T-Mobile before putting them on hold to explore a deal with Comcast Corp. and Charter Communications that could bolster those companies' plans to offer wireless service. Some industry observers think the Sprint-cable talks could push T-Mobile and its parent, Deutsche Telekom AG, to rekindle deal discussions with Dish after an earlier round in 2015 collapsed.

Messrs. Ergen and Bezos have been crossing paths more often. They spent time together in March at a satellite convention, where Mr. Bezos's rocket company, Blue Origin LLC, gave a presentation to Mr. Ergen's EchoStar Corp., a Dish sister company that builds satellite technology, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Ergen in March also attended Mr. Bezos's secretive, invite-only MARS robotics and space conference. More recently, the two moguls met in May in Seattle, other people familiar with the matter said.

The two executives are both eager disrupters: Mr. Ergen founded Dish in 1980 to take on cable TV and in 2015 launched Sling TV, the first online live TV service created by a traditional pay-TV provider to appeal to cord-cutters. Mr. Bezos has upended business models from books to media and is venturing into food retail with Amazon's planned acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc. valued at $13.7 billion.

Joining with Dish on a wireless network could potentially advance the online retail giant's ambitions in a range of new businesses. It could give the company quality control over connectivity for its Amazon Dash buttons -- which allow people to reorder household goods easily -- and its Echo speaker powered by its artificial intelligence assistant Alexa. And it could help improve Alexa's technology by putting the intelligence throughout the nodes of a wireless network, said one wireless executive who has worked with Amazon and Dish, enabling Alexa to be faster and more humanlike in its responses to searches due to proximity to users' locations.

It also could help Amazon's plans to operate a network of drones delivering packages to customers, wireless executives and people familiar with Amazon's thinking said. The company could ""command and control"" those drones and ""consider real-time changes in directions or multi-stop delivery routes through messages from the network,"" wrote Citigroup analysts speculating about a Dish-and-Amazon partnership in the wake of a May report from Satellite Business News.

Dish has been seeking to enter the wireless business for several years, as its core satellite TV business shrinks. Dish and its affiliated entities have spent more than $21 billion over the course of a decade to acquire airwaves nationwide, but Dish lacks a network to deploy the spectrum and has been on the hunt for a partner.

To meet a March 2020 government-mandated deadline to offer service on some of its spectrum, Dish is building a bare-bones, ""fifth-generation,"" or 5G, network that will cost less than $1 billion.

Citi analysts said a partnership between Dish and a technology giant like Amazon or Google could take many forms. Amazon could become a ""preferred customer"" on a new wireless network and commit to spending a certain amount on connectivity in exchange for a below-market rate. It could also provide cash upfront in Dish's network to help pay for the build out, in exchange for a significantly discounted price upon the launch of the network.

In a private meeting with investors and J.P. Morgan analysts in May, Mr. Ergen indicated he believed technology firms could be looking seriously at the wireless business, especially as the Trump administration seeks to roll back ""net neutrality"" rules that were meant to guard against carriers extracting tolls from content companies for better service, according to an attendee.

""They're going to have to make sure that in a world of net neutrality . . . being eliminated, that they're positioned so that they're not in a situation where their connectivity is clogged,"" Mr. Ergen said earlier in May."
Ctit Group,"Banking &amp;amp; Finance: Banks Face Hurdles After Stress Tests --- The Fed's approvals fuel a rally, but tough conditions on lending, rates are still an issue"," Jul 5, 2017",1,"Bank stocks soared after lenders handily passed the Federal Reserve's stress tests, but the upbeat finish to the second quarter belies a tough spell amid challenging lending and interest-rate conditions.

Those trends threaten to drag on banks' performance in coming months, a potential counterweight to the higher dividends and share buybacks many banks announced last week. In the second quarter, growth in business lending fell to its slowest pace since spring 2011. Long-term interest rates remain close to historically low levels, despite an uptick in the last week of June. And market volatility remains subdued, resulting in muted trading activity.

""As we head into the second half of the year, the question is how long can banks fight the fundamentals,"" said James Chappell, an analyst at banking group Berenberg. ""Earnings expectations may be too high.""

Worries about banks' underlying performance have weighed on their stocks this year, even though first-quarter results were strong. Financial stocks in the S&P 500 have led all sectors since November's U.S. election, but the bulk of the gains came in late 2016. In the first half of 2017, financial stocks trailed the broader market.

In the second quarter, the KBW Nasdaq Bank index, which tracks 24 of the U.S.'s biggest banks, lagged behind the S&P 500 until the stress-test results were announced June 28. The end-of-quarter surge happened as banks announced shareholder payouts -- through dividends and share buybacks -- that are just shy of their highest level relative to earnings in nearly two decades, according to analysts at Barclays.

Regional banks didn't get the same bump. The KBW Regional Banking index was nearly unchanged in the second quarter, trailing the broader market. In the first half, it was down more than 4%.

Besides the immediate prospect of more cash in hand for shareholders, the stress tests also bolstered investor hopes that the Trump administration would usher in a period of less-stringent bank regulation. That approach could help bolster returns on equity, which have remained tepid.

Donald Trump's election spurred hopes for even broader changes from Washington, namely a tax-code overhaul and policies, such as major infrastructure spending, that would promote stronger economic growth. But these have yet to bear fruit.

That has led to a decline in confidence that growth will accelerate. As a result, long-term interest rates slid in the second quarter.

At the same time, short-term rates have marched higher thanks to continued increases in the Fed's rates.

The result: The difference in yields between 10-year and two-year Treasurys, which is a proxy for the profits banks can make from borrowing and lending money, fell below 1 percentage point in mid-May. It has stayed there since and closed the quarter at 0.90 percentage point. In the wake of the election, the spread topped out at 1.35 percentage points in late December.

Bank of America Corp. Chief Executive Brian Moynihan told investors in May that the bank's potential net-interest income growth in the second quarter could be lower by tens of millions of dollars compared with the first quarter. ""We always follow the [yield] curve, and it's been lower,"" Mr. Moynihan said at an investor conference.

The other point of concern, slowing lending activity, is a bit of a mystery. Bank executives have been at a loss to explain the decline, especially given the surge of optimism among business owners following the election.

Loans and leases in bank credit, which are counted on a weekly basis, were up 3.8% in late June compared with the same period in 2016, according to Fed data released on Friday. That was the slowest rate of growth in more than three years. The week before the presidential election, banks registered a 7.3% rate.

Meanwhile, trading activity has been held back as hopes for an uptick in inflation, which would lead long-term interest rates higher, have faded. Also, volatility levels during the quarter plumbed historic lows, which also suppressed trading.

Executives at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. warned during the second quarter that trading revenues may be down by double-digit percentage points from those of the year-earlier period."
Ctit Group,Overseas Deal Making Stays Brisk," Jul 3, 2017",1,"LONDON -- European deal making is set to march on in the second half of the year despite Britain's latest election surprise and early signs of an acrimonious breakup with the European Union, some investment bankers say.

U.K. voters this month unexpectedly denied British Prime Minister Theresa May a majority government, while disagreements overBritain's financial commitments to separate from the EU are flaring.

Both developments pose potential challenges for deal-making, particularly in the U.K. -- among Europe's most active merger-and-acquisition markets -- as political uncertainty brings potential changes to tax, trade and other policies that make valuing transactions more difficult.

Still, deal value has soared in Europe this year despite recent geopolitical quakes that have surprised markets, most notably the Brexit vote.

Overall, deal value in which the acquirer or target is a European is up nearly 16% in the first half of 2017 from the year-earlier period, according to Dealogic, a data provider, despite a drop in the number of transactions by 1.3%.

That trend highlights the preferences for mergers and acquisitions for some big North American and European companies as they seek to cut costs, boost investment in new technologies or seek new sources of revenue to boost profit. They are encouraged by cheap financing and rising equity markets.

""Investors like M&A at the moment because it's an alternative to organic growth,"" for companies that face weak demand from their existing business or technological disruption, said Dietrich Becker, a senior investment banker at Perella Weinberg Partners. ""That's an overriding theme [and] that's something that's going to continue to drive people's agendas.""

If European companies don't seize the initiative to act, activist investors are showing signs of impatience. Nestle SA faces such a scenario in the form of U.S. hedge fund Third Point LLC, which disclosed that it bought a 1.25% stake in the packaged-foods giant for $3.5 billion and urged changes to help boost the company's stock price.

Several large deals announced this year have set the pace for the rest of 2017.

Among them Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.'s $5.2 billion deal to acquire Patheon NV, a Dutch-based drug development technology company, and the 16.3 billion euro ($18.5 billion) bid that same month by Italian infrastructure group Atlantia SpA for Spanish rival Abertis Infraestructuras SA.

As other big deals are completed -- such as the $49 billion merger between Luxottica Group SpA and Essilor International SA in January -- bankers expect a raft of smaller deals to take their place.

""We are going to see more smaller-scale deals"" for the rest of the year, said Wilhelm Schulz, Citigroup Inc.'s chairman of M&A for Europe, Middle East and Africa.

Experts don't expect the activity to be led by China. Chinese deal making into Europe, last year a key driver of activity, remained muted in the first half due to Beijing's restrictions on capital outflows.

In another potential setback, China's banking regulator recently initiated a review of the borrowing activity of some of the country's more acquisitive conglomerates, including Anbang Insurance Group Co., HNA Group Co. and Fosun International Ltd.

However, the country's global ambitions remain. China Investment Corp. in June agreed to buy Blackstone Group LP's European warehouse business for 12.25 billion euros. China's Fortune Fountain Capital, meanwhile, recently agreed to acquire 90% of Baccarat from a group of private-equity firms for 164 million euros, aiming to accelerate the French luxury crystal maker's expansion plans in Asia and the Middle East.

""There's ample rationale for, and evidence that, Chinese groups will continue to make acquisitions in Europe and elsewhere in the West,"" said Thierry d'Argent, global co-head of coverage and investment banking at Societe Generale.

The trend in rising mergers and acquisitions is also underpinned by the confidence CEOs are feeling from the availability of cheap financing and strengthening equity markets, some bankers say.

Interest rates in Europe remain near record lows, continuing to benefit from central-bank efforts to stimulate economic growth in part through bond-buying programs.

Assets held by the European Central Bank on its balance sheet total 4.2 trillion euros, almost double the amount at the start of 2015."
Ctit Group,Markets Review &amp;amp; Outlook: Second Quarter: Investors Lose Faith in OPEC Cuts --- Market went into bear territory in June as U.S. oil production beat expectations," Jul 3, 2017",1,"Oil prices tumbled in the second quarter, swinging into a bear market as many investors who at the start of the year clung to hopes of rapidly shrinking stockpiles finally cut their losses.

Crude ended the quarter 9% lower and sank as much as 21.9% in June from highs set in February. A loss of 20% or more typically signals the start of a bear market.

It is a sharp shift from the first months of 2017, when investors had been divided over whether members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would stick to pledges to cut output but generally believed those cuts would help ease the global supply glut and lift prices.

For a time, it seemed almost nothing could shake oil investors out of their malaise. Prices fell even after OPEC announced it would extend its cuts into next year and the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. stockpiles fell nearly every week during the quarter.

At the same time, U.S. output has risen more quickly than many predicted: The EIA is now forecasting that it will average a record of 10 million barrels a day next year. Output from Libya and Nigeria, OPEC members exempt from the production-cut agreements, has ramped up as well.

Bullish investors ""are burned, they are tired and they are surly. Now they're starting to go short,"" said Robert McNally, president of Rapidan Group. ""Hell hath no fury like a hedge fund scorned.""

Hedge funds and other speculative investors have piled into bets on falling oil prices. Bullish bets still outnumber bearish ones but by the slimmest margin since August, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Prices ended the quarter on a high note, rising 2.47% Friday, after oil-field services firm Baker Hughes Inc. reported that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. edged lower by two, the first weekly decline since January, raising hopes that U.S. drillers are responding to lower prices by pulling back. During the last week of the quarter, prices of U.S. crude futures rose 7% -- the largest weekly increase since Dec. 2, the week OPEC struck its deal to cut output. The seven-session streak of gains assuaged worries that prices were on course to fall below $40 a barrel.

But the world is still awash in oil.

""All the bearish things are kind of still in play"" said David Leben, director of commodity derivatives at BNP Paribas.

Even though many analysts still say that crude inventories are falling and that OPEC's efforts will work, many investors are no longer buying it. Increasingly, the market is divided between those who believe OPEC's efforts are paying off and those who don't.

""It's alarming to people because this cycle has played out very fast,"" said Robin Wehbe, managing director of Boston Co., who runs the Dreyfus Natural Resources Fund. ""The oil market has gone from a cartel-managed business to an open-market-driven business.""

Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de facto leader, has a lot riding on higher oil prices. The country is targeting oil prices of $60 a barrel to smooth the way for the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, its national oil company. That is one reason some investors still hope that OPEC will make deeper cuts.

Citigroup Inc. is among the firms that believe the market is actually getting tighter, but the firm's analysts say for now, negative sentiment could be hard to shake.

Citigroup analysts say the chances that Brent crude futures will climb to $60 by the end of the year are less than 50%, down from their previous estimate of a 65% chance. Brent settled at $47.92 Friday.

""The fund community has been burned so badly as to reduce the likelihood of them jumping back in no matter what the fundamentals,"" the analysts wrote in a June 26 research note.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on Wednesday also cut its three-month forecast for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for crude, to $47.50 a barrel from $55.

Investors are increasingly turning their attention to 2018, where the outlook is murky.

Many wonder whether OPEC producers will unleash a flood of oil once their agreement ends.

The Goldman Sachs analysts said there is a ""shrinking window of time"" for global oil supplies to fall before OPEC is tempted to start churning out more oil. That leaves the analysts ""cautious of calling for a sharp bounce in prices here,"" they said."
Ctit Group,Ford CEO Presses Decision Making," Jul 1, 2017",0,"Ford Motor Co.'s new chief executive is enforcing a ""shot clock"" on lingering decisions at the auto maker to implement plans faster and regain competitive footing in vital segments of the car business.

CEO Jim Hackett, speaking to analysts this week, rolled out the shot-clock idea -- borrowing from a rule employed in basketball to quicken the pace of the game -- as part of his agenda for the first 100 days in his new job.

Mr. Hackett, who succeeded Mark Fields at the helm in May, spoke Thursday with Wall Street analysts, the first such meeting for Ford's new chief as he confronts an underperforming stock price. The company has been widely criticized for appearing indecisive on important technology bets, including self-driving cars or electric vehicles.

In addition to setting firmer deadlines on decisions, Mr. Hackett said he plans to focus on costs, according to analysts' reports recounting the event. He also wants to move faster to target weaknesses in the business, such as slumping U.S. sedan sales.

""Mr. Hackett acknowledged that past slow decision-making -- sometimes caused by confusion over 'who was in charge' within newer efforts -- has been an issue at Ford,"" said Itay Michaeli, an analyst with Citigroup.

Ford and other conventional auto makers are scrambling to counter the automotive ambitions of such tech giants as Alphabet Inc., Intel Corp. and Apple Inc., and electric auto maker Tesla Inc.

Ford is now investing in autonomous-vehicle research, including taking financial stakes in startups, and is spending more than $4 billion to improve its electric-car lineup. Mr. Hackett signaled an openness to revisit the strategy he inherited from Mr. Fields, the analysts said.

The CEO change, coming as Ford's stock traded about 40% below its level when Mr. Fields became chief in 2014, is seen as an attempt to fix the 114-year-old company's culture.

A Ford spokesman confirmed the meeting with analysts took place."
Ctit Group,Bank Stocks Rally on Higher Dividends," Jun 30, 2017",0,"Bank stocks rallied Thursday after strong stress-test results led many lenders to increase dividends and share buybacks. The surge came on a day when the market overall slumped on falling technology shares.

The green light from the Federal Reserve for big banks to return loftier levels of capital led investors to put aside for the moment worries about the future direction of long-term interest rates or policy ructions in Washington.

Instead, they were salivating over the prospect of higher dividend yields at banks.

""The capital return tide has turned,"" Morgan Stanley bank analyst Betsy Graseck wrote in a note to investors Thursday. ""Yield investors will have to start paying more attention to bank stocks, expanding the investor base.""

Consider that Bank of America Corp. shares were yielding about 1.26% Wednesday, based on the bank's prior annual dividend payout of 30 cents a share. The bank said Wednesday, following the release of the stress-test results, that it would jack the annual dividend up to 48 cents a share.

That would push the prospective dividend yield to around 2%, even taking into account the increase in Bank of America's stock Thursday. The shares rose 1.8%.

While yields on U.S. Treasury securities have risen in recent days, such dividend-yield increases put some bank-stock payouts more in line with longer-dated government bonds. The five-year U.S. Treasury note, for example, yielded 1.85% in Thursday trading.

Shares of other big banks, such as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co. and Citigroup Inc., also rose Thursday. Those banks, too, had announced increased dividends the evening before. Sweetening the pot, banks also announced sizable increases in their expected share buybacks over the coming year.

Overall, banks increased their payouts more than analysts had expected. Ms. Graseck noted that dividends could continue to increase, forecasting a median 11% increase in 2018 for stress-test banks following a 12% increase this year.

Reflecting the upbeat sentiment, the KBW Nasdaq Bank index rose more than 1% Thursday even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 167.58 points, or 0.8%.

Michael Levine, manager of the OppenheimerFunds $4 billion Equity Income fund, said he remains optimistic on banks in part because of likely dividend growth, especially at Citigroup, one of the fund's biggest holdings.

He sees the dividends as a sign of tangible progress for banks.

Between the November election and the end of 2016, the KBW index rose 23%. That was largely due to investor hopes for higher economic growth that would lead to higher interest rates, and so bank profits, as well as a reduction in bank regulation and an overhaul of the U.S. tax code.

While the Fed has raised short-term rates and there have been some signs of regulatory relief, investors' hopes have yet to be fully realized. A rise in longer-term rates in recent days, for example, hadn't brought much relief to banks. The difference in yields between the 10-year and two-year Treasury was just 0.90 percentage point, a low level that can signal a squeeze on bank profits.

Given that, capital returns become even more important. ""We don't think rates are going to skyrocket, and regulatory change has become more vulnerable,"" Mr. Levine said. ""But you're still going to have relatively attractive dividend growth.""

Even with Wednesday's announced dividend increases, yields often remain below pre-financial crisis payout levels. Shares in Bank of America, for instance, had an average yield of 3.36% from June 1997 to June 2007, according to FactSet.

One unknown, though, is how consistent growth will be in coming years for capital returns. That depends on the Federal Reserve.

Before the financial crisis, bank boards decided on dividend or buyback increases. Now, though, the banks must go through annual stress tests and the Fed must sign off on their capital plans.

Not everyone was joining the bank-stock celebration. Terry McEvoy, a bank analyst at Stephens Inc., remained more focused on whether looser regulation and tax changes will materialize. He said he believes those are necessary for bank shares to advance further.

Meanwhile, Citigroup bank analyst Keith Horowitz wrote Thursday that the only development was a change in the timeline for when capital would be returned.

Because investors knew the capital would eventually be returned, the announcement had little impact on his valuation estimates.

""This is why we do not share the view of others that these results are a big positive,"" Mr. Horowitz wrote."
Ctit Group,"Banks Boost Payouts After Passing Tests --- In turning point for industry, Fed sanctions large increase in dividends, buybacks"," Jun 29, 2017",1,"Big U.S. banks plan to increase dividend payouts and share buybacks to their highest levels in years after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved capital plans for all 34 firms taking part in its annual stress tests.

The approvals -- the first time since the annual tests began in 2011 that all firms got passing grades -- reflect a turning point for big financial institutions that have been shackled by tighter regulation since the financial crisis. They could also herald a return to precrisis days when banks were reliable dividend payers and shareholders flocked to them.

Bank of America Corp., for example, said that it would increase its dividend by 60% to 12 cents a share per quarter, putting it above a threshold where Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. may convert a stake in the firm into common stock and become the bank's largest shareholder. The second-biggest U.S. bank by assets also said it received approval to repurchase up to $12.9 billion of its shares, far above the $7.7 billion it bought back over the previous year.

On average, the group of firms taking part in the stress tests requested payouts that are near 100% of their expected earnings over the next year, up from 65% last year, senior Fed officials said. That means banks in some cases will be able to start whittling away at capital buffers that many bank executives say are well in excess of what is needed to absorb potential losses.

Such moves signal an easing of the Fed's hardline stance toward banks since the crisis and could provide a durable pillar of support for higher bank stock prices. Those soared following President Donald Trump's election but largely have treaded water so far in 2017 amid lackluster economic indicators, political defeats for the White House and a flattening yield curve that threatens to weigh on bank profits.

The KBW Nasdaq Bank index is up 2.8% year to date versus an 8.9% gain for the S&P 500. That said, bank stocks are still well ahead of the broader market when measured from November's election. Big-bank shares rose in many cases more than 1% in after-hours trading Wednesday, while some, like Citigroup Inc., were up more than 2%.

The payouts announced by banks Wednesday were in many cases above investor expectations. Citigroup, for instance, said it planned to return $18.9 billion to shareholders over the coming four quarters. That is equal to 132% of what Wall Street analysts expect the bank to earn over the same period. Analysts had expected the bank's payout ratio would be around 110%.

Morgan Stanley and Alabama-based Regions Financial Corp. were also among those that were approved for payout ratios in excess of 100%, according to FactSet estimates and Wall Street Journal reviews of corporate filings.

""The absolute minimum is there won't be increased capital in these businesses,"" Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman said earlier this month. ""There shouldn't be and there won't be.""

Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and State Street Corp. cleared one of the Fed's yardsticks by just tenths of a percentage point, suggesting they have gotten more adept at figuring out how to squeak through the tests.

The latest result was the second part of the Fed's test results. In the first leg, released last week, the Fed said all big U.S. banks were able to survive a hypothetical recession.

Fed governor Jerome Powell said the stress-test process, now in its seventh year, ""has motivated all of the largest banks to achieve healthy capital levels.""

Born of the financial meltdown, the stress tests have come to command bankers' and investors' attention. Executives manage with the tests in mind and have collectively spent billions of dollars to develop risk-management systems to meet the Fed's expectations.

This year's passing grades suggest that those efforts have paid off. Banks today are better capitalized and more conservatively managed than before the financial crisis and have better insight into risks lurking in their own books.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the nation's biggest bank by assets, was approved for a 12% increase to its dividend and a $19.4 billion buyback program. CEO James Dimon said the bank was ""pleased to further increase capital returns to our shareholders while continuing to invest in our businesses.""

In a nod to progress at banks, the Fed has made changes to the exams. This year, only 13 of the biggest, most complex banks faced a qualitative exam of their risk-management abilities. Others, such as the U.S. arm of Spain's Banco Santander SA, had to pass only a numerical assessment.

The results had some banks breathing sighs of relief. At Santander, the U.S. chief executive said he planned to hold a champagne toast in the boardroom after the Fed approved its capital plan. The bank had failed the tests the previous three years.

Wells Fargo & Co.'s approval, too, is a sorely needed win for the bank, which has been in the spotlight for months over a sales-practices scandal. Some analysts had predicted that the Fed might flunk Wells Fargo on ""qualitative"" grounds even if it passed the numerical part of the exam.

Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said this spring that the bank was ""very self-aware"" of that risk and that it had ""sized our [capital-return] ask appropriately.""

The Fed said the largest and most complex firms, however, still have work to do in maintaining accurate data and identifying risks in new products.

One spot hit hard this year was credit cards. Credit-card defaults are rising after years in record-low territory and were a chief focus of Fed officials who designed this year's tests. Last week's results forecast $100 billion of credit-card losses in a severe downturn across the industry.

Two of the largest stand-alone card issuers, Capital One Financial Corp. and American Express Co., revised their payout requests downward after receiving the results of the stress test's first part last week."
Ctit Group,U.S. News: Breaking Down the New Dividends and Buybacks," Jun 29, 2017",1,"The largest U.S. banks all said they would increase their dividends and share buybacks, a move cheered by investors that followed the banks receiving passing grades on the Federal Reserve's stress tests Wednesday.

Here is how the new dividends and buybacks break down at the biggest banks:

-- Bank of America Corp. boosted its quarterly dividend 60% to 12 cents a share from the current 7.5 cents.

The bank also plans to buy back $12.9 billion worth of shares over a four-quarter period versus $7.7 billion in the previous period.

Warren Buffett has said a dividend of this size would prompt his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to swap its preferred shares in the bank into about $17 billion worth of common stock.

-- Citigroup Inc. is increasing its quarterly dividend to 32 cents a share from16 cents.

It also plans to buy back $15.6 billion compared with $10.4billion in its buyback plan last year.

The bank's capital return plan of $18.9 billion over the next four quarters is above the $15 billion to $18 billion that Citigroup said it needed to achieve to be credible with shareholders hoping for a solid return.

-- J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. plans to increase its quarterly dividend to 56 cents a share from the current 50 cents a share.

The largest U.S. bank by assets also plans to buy back up to $19.4 billion of stock in the four-quarter period versusthe $10.6 billion it planned for the 12 months ending June 30.

-- Wells Fargo & Co. plans to boost its quarterly dividend to 39 cents from 38 cents.

The bank also plans to buy back up to $11.5 billion of stock versus $8.3 billion for the four-quarter period ended March 31.

Wells Fargo has been in the spotlight since last September when its sales practices scandal emerged. It then paid a $185 million settlement but has continued to face public scrutiny over investigations and other regulatory problems. Analysts for months have also pressed the bank's management about its CCAR submission."
Ctit Group,Federal Reserve's Stress Tests Fuel Rally in Bank Shares," Jun 29, 2017",1,"The next leg of the banking rally is taking shape.

Bank stocks soared after the November election on expectations that economic growth and interest rates would rise. The rally stalled this year as investors become less optimistic on the economy, and long-term interest rates declined.

Now, factors are aligning again for a new bank rally. Long-term interest rates are rebounding, not only in the U.S. but also sharply in Europe and the U.K. This is significant since ultralow rates abroad had been acting as an anchor on U.S. rates.

Even more important, major banks have now all passed the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests. On Wednesday, the Fed gave the country's biggest lenders a green light to substantially boost dividends and share buybacks.

On Wednesday, Citigroup doubled its quarterly dividend and said it would buy back $15.6 billion of stock over the next four quarters, up from $10.4 billion in the previous stress-test cycle. Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase also increased their dividends and buybacks.

Analysts raised concerns last week that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley might have to scale back their capital-return ambitions after they came close to hitting regulatory limits on a new measure of overall leverage in the tests. But the two banks received approval for their capital-return plans anyway.

Morgan Stanley boosted its quarterly dividend by 25% and said it would buy back $5 billion of shares over the next four quarters, up from $3.5 billion the previous four.

These payouts are crucial for bank shares. Not only do they go directly into shareholders' pockets, they help the banks whittle down piles of excess capital that weigh on their returns. Particularly for lower-valued banks like Citigroup and Bank of America, reducing this dormant capital is crucial to achieving higher valuations.

The only institutions that had to dial down their payout plans were two consumer lenders -- Capital One Financial and American Express. The biggest negative surprise of the Fed's stress tests this year was higher-than-expected losses on credit-card loans in a recession scenario.

This suggests that consumer debt, including credit cards as well as auto and other personal loans, is a potential risk area for the entire sector.

Credit losses are still very low and bank shares have rallied this week on higher rates. The Fed's tests will add to the enthusiasm. After a long pause, the bank rally is back on."
Ctit Group,"Business News: UPS Set To Freeze Pensions For 70,000"," Jun 28, 2017",0,"Corrections & Amplifications

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters union was incorrectly called the United Brotherhood of Teamsters in a Business News article Wednesday about United Parcel Service Inc.'s plans to freeze pension plans for nonunion employees.

(WSJ June 29, 2017)

United Parcel Service Inc. will freeze pension plans for about 70,000 nonunion employees, seeking to contain the burden of a retirement fund with a nearly $10 billion deficit.

The package carrier is the latest major U.S. corporation seeking to corral rising pension obligations, which have swollen after years of low interest rates. The collective deficit in pension plans of S&P 1500 companies totaled $408 billion at the end of last year, according to consulting firm Mercer.

The Atlanta-based company, which is spending billions to expand its network to handle the surge in e-commerce shipments, said Tuesday it will freeze pension benefits in five years for nonunion workers. It will move those individuals to 401(k) accounts and contribute funds to those retirement plans.

UPS has more than 434,000 workers worldwide, with more than 80% in the U.S. Most of them are unionized and won't be affected by the changes. But the move could set up a showdown with the United Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 268,000 UPS workers and is preparing to negotiate a new contract.

A pension freeze puts UPS in line with a wide swath of American corporations. In 2014, 37% of Fortune 500 companies with defined benefit plans had frozen them in some way, compared with 35% with open plans, according to the consultancy Willis Towers Watson. That was the first year that frozen plans outpaced all other types, including closed or terminated. As recently as 2010, half of large companies with defined benefit plans were open.

UPS is trying to make a dent in a U.S. pension deficit that reached $9.85 billion at the end of 2016, according to its annual report. The plans, with $41.07 billion in obligations, were 76% funded at that point, down from nearly 90% at the end of 2013.

Like most corporate pension sponsors, UPS fell victim to historically low interest rates. Companies calculate the value of future benefits based on interest rates. Obligations rise when rates fall. A precipitous drop in interest rates -- which have stayed lower for longer than many pension managers expected after the financial crisis -- helped drive up the shipper's deficit.

While interest rates have pushed up the obligations, UPS helped compound the problem, by neglecting to add enough to the plan to make the up the difference. Although the company contributed almost $5 billion into its fund between 2012 and 2016, it only made minimum contributions required by law in 2012. In 2013 it put no money into the plan.

UPS says it has adequately funded its pension. While it didn't make a contribution in 2013, its pension deficit went down more than $3.6 billion that year due to interest rate changes. ""We make funding decisions for each year and over a longer time horizon,"" UPS Finance Chief Richard Peretz said in an interview.

Teamsters spokesman Galen Munroe declined to comment.

UPS's pension struggles mirror broader funding problems among companies that offer retirement benefits. The median S&P 1500 pension plan's funded status was 76% at the end of 2016, according to a report by the financial strategies group at Citigroup Inc.

Companies are required by law to close those gaps over time, but the deficits have persisted, even though S&P 1500 firms collectively have contributed more than $550 billion into the plans from 2008 to 2016."
Ctit Group,Citi Picks European Banker as Adviser," Jun 27, 2017",1,"Citigroup Inc. has hired a high-profile former J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank AG investment banker as a senior adviser.

Karl-Georg Altenburg also takes a seat on a newly formed advisory board that the U.S. bank and its corporate clients can tap as they navigate Britain's impending split from the European Union and other major changes taking place across the region.

Currently based in London, Mr. Altenburg, 54 years old, brings with him deep knowledge of the German and surrounding markets. He was most recently Deutsche Bank's co-head of corporate finance in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, before retiring in late 2015. That decision followed the restructuring of the Germany-based bank's investment bank into two operations, one focused on investment banking and the other on trading and global markets. In March, Deutsche Bank moved to recombine the two units. Before joining Deutsche Bank, Mr. Altenburg headed J.P. Morgan's operations in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

Citi's new advisory board brings together former politicians and bankers from the U.K., Germany, the Nordics and France with several senior Citigroup executives overseeing the bank's EMEA operations. The aim is to help strengthen the bank's corporate and investment-banking business in EMEA. Many of the board members already have roles at Citi. The bank hopes the board's creation will give members more opportunity to share ideas that the bank can take advantage of to help foster client relationships.

The effort comes as Citi's business advising on mergers and acquisitions in the EMEA arena is having a strong year. It is ranked atop the M&A league table for the region."
Ctit Group,Banking Stress Tests Less Stressful," Jun 26, 2017",0,"WASHINGTON -- ""Stress tests,"" long dreaded by executives at the nation's largest banks, are getting easier.

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday will release the final results of this year's tests, which probe firms' ability to withstand a severe financial shock. Officials made the tests easier for some banks this year, and for the next time around they are preparing to further change the exams in fundamental ways.

The most significant shift would remove a major risk for banks: failing the tests purely for subjective reasons. The qualitative part of the tests has in past years created embarrassing failures for firms such as Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, and Banco Santander SA.

Fed officials now envision a system where firms would generally only fail the test if their capital levels falls below the level the Fed views as healthy -- in other words for quantitative reasons, not qualitative ones.

That likely means fewer test failures. Between 2014 and 2016, the Fed gave banks a failing grade nine times. Only once did a bank fail the test because of a low capital ratio: Zions Bancorp. in 2014.

The tests will continue to matter to investors. The Fed will still use them to audit banks' plans to boost dividends and buybacks for shareholders, and the numerical part of the exams will still be crucial to determining those payouts.

Nevertheless, a reduced emphasis on the subjective aspects of the exams could make the tests far less tense for bankers.

""The qualitative [part of the tests] is a lot of process work,"" William Demchak, chief executive of PNC Financial Services Group Inc., said in a June interview.

He said the risk committee of the bank's board discusses aspects of the exams at each regular meeting, even though sometimes ""there is no reason to"" do so because there haven't been significant changes to the firm's program. ""But we do, to prove [to the Fed] we have a quality review.""

PNC has never failed the tests.

The idea of a bank supervisor publicly calling out a bank's failings has always made some policy makers nervous. After all, one of supervisors' primary jobs is to prevent damaging ""runs"" that occur when the public loses confidence in banks and withdraws deposits en masse. If regulators have problems with bankers, they almost always address them privately.

Former Fed governor Daniel Tarullo, who helped build the tests while serving as the Fed's regulatory point man between 2009 and earlier this year, has said the Fed departed from a tradition of privacy in part because he and other officials were ""stunned"" during the financial crisis at what they viewed as banks' inability to quickly assess the risks they faced.

They created an annual stress test with two main parts. One judges whether banks' plans for paying out capital to shareholders would still allow them to withstand a hypothetical economic downturn. The other part is a ""qualitative"" evaluation of how they manage risks. If a bank fails either part, the Fed discloses they have failed the tests and rejects their requests for higher payouts.

""The potential for embarrassing, public"" stress-test failures ""was intended to, and has, focused the minds of banks' senior management on their capital positions and capital planning processes,"" Mr. Tarullo said in an April speech.

In 2014, Mr. Tarullo and other senior Fed officials judged Citigroup hadn't made enough progress in improving risk management. The firm failed the qualitative portion of the tests and spent about $180 million during the second half of that year to meet the Fed's expectations. The failure also meant Citigroup couldn't boost shareholder dividends.

Other firms spent tens or hundreds of millions of dollars on the tests to ensure that they didn't end up in Citigroup's spot.

In 2017, Fed officials changed the rules. For 21 of 34 big banks, the qualitative part of the tests would no longer be a basis for failure. The 21 firms -- those with less than $250 billion in total assets and less than $75 billion in assets in nonbank businesses -- could still face a reprimand from the Fed, but that would happen privately as part of the Fed's yearround oversight.

In proposing the rule change, the Fed cited ""the high public profile"" of the tests and the risk that ""noncomplex firms will overinvest in stress testing,"" even though they pose less risk to the financial system than larger, more complex peers.

The change means those 21 firms are breathing easier ahead of Wednesday's results.

Mr. Tarullo also said in April ""the time may be coming"" to remove the qualitative portion of the tests for all firms, even large, complex ones such as Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Fed governor Jerome Powell, serving in Mr. Tarullo's role until President Donald Trump nominates a Fed vice chairman in charge of bank rules, supported the same idea in Senate testimony Thursday.

""Many of our largest banking firms have made substantial progress toward meeting supervisory expectations,"" Mr. Powell said. ""If that progress continues, I believe it will be appropriate to consider removing the qualitative [part of the tests] for those firms that achieve and sustain high-quality capital planning capabilities."""
Ctit Group,"World News: Fixing Economy Will Test Saudi Heir --- Crown prince pushes his ambitious plan to modernize, but law, tradition curb results"," Jun 23, 2017",1,"DUBAI -- Now that he has secured his place as next in line to the Saudi throne, Mohammed bin Salman faces his next big test: overhauling the kingdom's ailing economy.

As deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman last year championed a plan to transform the kingdom's oil-dependent economy by creating jobs, boosting the private sector and attracting foreign capital.

But more than a year later, the so-called Vision 2030 overhaul plan has made little headway. Saudi Arabia's revenues still largely rely on oil sales and with crude prices low, the kingdom has been forced to borrow heavily to shore up its finances.

The troubles bolster a perception that now-Crown Prince Mohammed has been fast to promise and slow to deliver. More important, they raise the prospect that the most unpopular economic overhauls he has promoted could be reversed.

""The promulgation of the new vision went at supersonic speed,"" said Florence Eid-Oakden, chief economist at Arabia Monitor, a London-based research and strategy firm. ""The implementation is going more slowly.""

The crown prince's push has come up hard against the bureaucratic and legal obstacles that have long made Saudi Arabia a difficult place to do business. In the World Bank's Doing Business Index, Saudi Arabia ranks 94 out of 190 economies. For ease in starting a business, the kingdom ranks 147, trailing Gulf neighbors Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

There also remain pockets of resistance to an overhaul among members of the royal family, the religious establishment, the business elite and the civil service, analysts say.

Not all members of the Allegiance Council, which has the final say over the issue of succession in the Saudi royal family, voted in favor of Prince Mohammed's promotion. This suggests there are still some in the royal family who aren't fully behind him.

Still, some analysts say the crown prince is better positioned to push ahead with an overhaul now that he is next in line to the Saudi throne, supplanting his more-cautious cousin Mohammed bin Nayef. He can consolidate domestic power and more effectively counter opposition to the 2030 plan, these people say, and eventually redirect and revitalize the region's biggest economy.

""The change in succession cements the prospects of the successful implementation of Vision 2030,"" said Giyas Gokkent, an economist at the Institute of International Finance, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representing global financial institutions.

Just hours before Mohammed bin Salman's promotion was announced Wednesday, index provider MSCI Inc. said that it would consider classifying the kingdom as an emerging market as early as next year, a move that could draw billions of dollars to the economy.

During his recent visit to Saudi Arabia, President Donald Trump also provided a vote of confidence. Mr. Trump was accompanied by a large delegation of prominent business leaders eager to explore opportunities in the kingdom and betting that its economic liberalization will prove profitable.

Banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. play a key role in advising and financing Vision 2030 overhauls, such as the listing of Saudi National Oil Co., or Aramco, a state asset that the new crown prince has previously valued at $2 trillion. Citigroup Inc. recently obtained a much-coveted banking license. General Electric Co. and other companies have pledged to invest billions of dollars in the Saudi economy."
Ctit Group,What Could Go Wrong in Federal Reserve's Stress Tests," Jun 22, 2017",1,"Investors are looking forward to a stress-free round of bank stress tests this week. But there could be complications.

The Federal Reserve will reveal on Thursday which of the 34 banks it tests have passed hypothetical negative scenarios while maintaining required capital levels.

Then next week it will say whether it has approved their plans to return capital to shareholders, a higher bar.

Last year, every bank subject to the test passed, and all but two got the nod for their capital payouts.

Investors expect another positive outcome this year. Going into the tests, banks overall have higher capital levels and better earnings prospects than last year. Analysts figure that Citigroup and Morgan Stanley could be in a position for the first time to pay out more than 100% of their projected profits.

Compared with last year, this year's test assumes a slightly more severe domestic recession.

Notably, it features a sharper decline in commercial real-estate prices -- 35% versus 30% in last year's tests.

Multifamily properties are assumed to suffer even bigger declines.

This means regional lenders with big commercial real-estate portfolios are probably at greater risk of failing.

In a report, analysts at Goldman Sachs Group pointed to Key Bank, M&T Bank and Zions Bancorp as having the highest ratios of commercial real-estate exposure to risk capital.

For investors, the more important results will be next week when the Fed says how much capital banks can pay out.

In an era of slow growth and low rates, bigger dividends and stock buybacks would be important drivers of bank shares.

Even if these regional lenders do pass the first round of the stress tests, and that is likely, if their capital levels come close to regulatory minimums in the ugly scenarios, the banks may scale back their payout requests. That could hurt their stocks.

Some investors are also concerned that Wells Fargo could have its return plan denied on ""qualitative"" grounds as part of the extended fallout from last year's account-sales fiasco. But Goldman's analysts figure this is unlikely given the amount of work the bank has done to reform its sales practices.

The most likely scenario is still that banks will pass this year's tests easily. But these few names are the ones to watch for potential surprises."
Ctit Group,Banks Rally Even as Yield Curve Flattens --- Unusual trend shows divergent opinions on which way the economy is headed," Jun 21, 2017",1,"Financial stocks are getting their groove back -- and they are doing it without help from the bond market.

S&P 500 financials are up 4.9% this month, on pace to be the best performer among the benchmark's 11 sectors. If that holds through the end of June, it would be the best month for the sector since February, when investors were still betting on an economic boom fueled by President Donald Trump's plans for tax cuts and deregulation.

The KBW Nasdaq Bank index is up 5.4% this month through Tuesday, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is up 6.6% and Morgan Stanley is up 9%.

The stocks of banks, insurers and other financial institutions typically climb when the differential between short-term rates and long-term rates is rising, a development known as a steepening yield curve. That is often thought to boost the net interest margins that banks harvest from borrowing at low short-term rates and lending at higher long-term rates.

But what is remarkable is that financials have rallied while the yield curve has been moving in the opposite direction. The differential between the two-year Treasury note yield and 10-year yield was at 0.81 percentage point on Tuesday, near its smallest since 2007. That is down from 0.92 percentage point at the end of last month.

The rally in financial stocks is at the center of diverging outlooks on the economy. Major stock indexes, and sectors such as financials that are sensitive to the economic outlook, have been gaining steam in recent sessions. At the same time, bond yields have been falling, signaling a less robust outlook for growth and inflation.

""As much as the bond-market vigilantes like to think they are right, it's not always the case,"" said Julian Emanuel, an equity and derivatives strategist at UBS. ""Price is a very powerful signaling mechanism, and the fact that the financials have outperformed while the yield curve is flattening leads us to believe there is a distinct possibility that the yield curve will stop flattening.""

During the week that ended June 14, investors poured $1.4 billion into funds that invest in the financial sector, the largest inflow in 14 weeks, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Investors also put $9 billion into bond funds, the 13th straight week of inflows. Meanwhile, investors have cooled on technology stocks in the past week, but still put $100 million into funds that invest in them.

Before the recent upturn, many investors had soured on financials in recent months as Mr. Trump's policy agenda stalled and economic data took a weaker turn. Citigroup Inc.'s U.S. economic-surprise index, which measures how data compare with forecasts, was at its lowest since 2011 on Friday after inflation and retail-sales numbers came in below economists' expectations.

If the economy continues to weaken, it could put the gains in the financial sector at risk. But at the moment, some see the economic outlook as excessively negative, meaning it is poised to rebound to match what bank stocks show. Plus, even if U.S. data continue to be soft, the global economy is expected to accelerate at the fastest pace since 2010 next year, according to Fitch Ratings.

""The market is making new highs here and expectations for the economy have gone straight south,"" said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. ""That to me suggests the potential for an upside surprise is much greater than the potential for a downside surprise.""

There are signs that the new administration wants to take a lighter touch to financial regulation. And while low market volatility can pose a challenge to banks' trading businesses, some analysts say volatility is poised to tick higher."
Ctit Group,The Ad Maze (A Special Report) --- New Publicis Chief Takes On a Turbulent Era," Jun 20, 2017",1,"Madison Avenue has a new power player: Arthur Sadoun.

Mr. Sadoun was installed earlier this month as the new chief executive of advertising giant Publicis Groupe SA. The 46-year-old is only the third chief executive to lead the storied ad conglomerate in its 91-year history.

Known for his client-handling skills, Mr. Sadoun has big shoes to fill. He takes over from Maurice Levy, the widely respected ad chief who led the Paris-based firm for almost 30 years and was named chairman of the supervisory board. Mr. Levy transformed Publicis into the third-largest ad holding company in the world, with 9.73 billion euros ($11 billion) in revenue last year and 80,000 employees crafting marketing for brands such as Nestle SA, Samsung Electronics Co. and Citigroup Inc.

Mr. Sadoun is charged with navigating the company through the most turbulent time in marketing. Technology now enables consumers to more easily avoid ads, the dominance of Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google continues to grow, and the trust between agencies and marketers in the $529 billion global ad business has been damaged by a report that was released last year that said the U.S. ad industry is full of nontransparent business practices.

Mr. Sadoun will need to help the company get back on track after losing significant assignments from a rash of companies such as Procter & Gamble Co. Its bold acquisition of Sapient has also failed to live up to expectations.

The Wall Street Journal caught up with the newly installed ad czar to discuss the brewing tensions between advertisers and tech giants, the challenges ad companies face, and how rising populism is affecting marketing.

Edited excerpts:

WSJ: What is the biggest threat to ad companies?

Mr. Sadoun: If the industry does not bring back growth to our clients' business, we will be in danger. We have to overcome the fragmentation that now makes marketing splintered. We must be delivering expertise in technology and data and think very broadly about creativity.

WSJ: Have Google and Facebook done enough to calm the concerns marketers have about brand safety and measurement?

Mr. Sadoun: We've been pleased to see Google and Facebook's recent efforts in this area. But there is a lot more they will need to do. Clients are worried by the lack of transparency on how and where their marketing messages are distributed and/or seen, how the algorithms work and the 'just trust us' approach. Today, leveraging data is key to marketing, but the limited amount of data clients get back about their [marketing] programs and the lack of a true ability to work across platforms, like they can do on the open internet, is a problem. It's the clients' money and data after all. We need a lot more access.

WSJ: Publicis recently wrote down the value of Sapient, a digital-technology company. What's been the biggest challenge?

Mr. Sadoun: The premium we paid for Sapient was not completely justified due to slower growth than we had anticipated. So we reflected this slower growth by taking this noncash charge. The struggles for growth, partly, came from us underestimating how difficult it is to get technologists and marketing working together. They are different cultures. We have been winning business and seeing momentum globally.

WSJ: There is a real lack of trust between agencies and marketers following the Association of National Advertisers' probe that discovered a lack of transparency in the way agencies conduct business. How can ad companies repair the relationships? [euro]

Mr. Sadoun: At Publicis, we believe any areas of conflict of interest must be eliminated right away and clients should never feel that there is any part of the process that they do not have transparency into. While we have passed all the audits to date, we remain committed to reaffirming a trusted and principled relationship.

WSJ: There has been a huge rise in populism around the world. What does that mean for marketers?

Mr. Sadoun: We have to acknowledge that there is almost everywhere in the world a middle class that is really in pain. This is something that we need to take into account at the political level, but also in the way we communicate. It has never been so important to make sure that whatever you do, you make people understand what you bring into their day-to-day life. This is what we are trying to do with our clients. A brand that is strong is a brand that is playing a concrete role in people's life.

WSJ: Where will ad companies be in five years?

Mr. Sadoun: The one prediction I will make is that there is likely to be more changes in our industry in the next five years than in the past 20."
Ctit Group,Citigroup Looks to Go on Offense --- CEO Corbat faces a growing consensus that now is the time for bank to shift tack," Jun 20, 2017",1,"Investors want Michael Corbat to change the narrative at Citigroup Inc.

Since taking the bank's helm in October 2012, Mr. Corbat's Citigroup has played defense. It has scaled back businesses, shrunk the firm's global retail-banking footprint and wound down crisis-era assets that dragged on returns.

For shareholders, it has been a slog. Citigroup's total return has underperformed those of its biggest rivals, save for Wells Fargo & Co., since Mr. Corbat arrived on the scene. The bank has yet to show it can consistently generate returns that exceed its cost of capital; in the first quarter the bank's return on common equity was a tepid 7.4%. And the stock trades at just 85% of book value, the lowest valuation of the big U.S. banks.

Now, investors, analysts and even top executives within the bank say it is time for Mr. Corbat, a former Harvard football star, to shift to offense. That means boosting growth and profitability in areas such as credit cards, Wall Street stock trading and retail banking.

""What investors want now is to understand what's next in the story,"" said Conor Muldoon, fundamental portfolio manager at Causeway Capital Management LLC. ""What can you do to make the valuation better over time?""

Citigroup is among the largest holdings in the firm's Global Value fund.

The first test comes this week and next with the Federal Reserve's annual bank stress tests. A key indicator will be the bank's so-called payout ratio under the tests, a measure of whether it is given a green light to return more capital to shareholders than it is expected to earn in coming quarters.

Citigroup shareholders want to see the payout ratio top 100%, meaning the bank would begin drawing down its capital pile rather than continue adding to it. If it can't do this, gains in its business won't accrue to shareholders.

Assuming that won't be the case, investors want Mr. Corbat to boost returns over the long term by generating more profit on lagging businesses, notably the bank's consumer-lending and retail-banking arm.

In anticipation of this, Mr. Corbat has been honing the bank's focus, a notable change for a firm that was once a sprawling global behemoth.

Ctit Group,"Business News: EQT, Rice Energy in $6.7 Billion Natural-Gas Deal"," Jun 20, 2017",1,"EQT Corp. agreed to buy Rice Energy Inc. for $6.7 billion in the latest proposed tie-up between energy producers suffering from low oil and gas prices.

EQT said the deal was driven by the opportunity to drill longer horizontal wells by adding Rice's acreage to its own footprint. Rice's pipeline assets will also allow EQT to get more of its natural gas to markets including the Gulf and to benefit from benchmark pricing at Henry Hub in Louisiana.

Rice shares rose 25% Monday, while EQT's stock fell 9%. Rice shares had highs above $33 during a big discovery in 2014.

EQT and Rice have significant amounts of debt and have suffered from the glut of natural gas that has caused gas prices to fall 60% from June 2014.

EQT Chief Executive Steve Schlotterbeck told an analyst call Monday that the deal will create the country's biggest natural-gas producer. Tim Rezvan, a managing director at Mizuho Securities, said the combined output would top 3.5 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas.

Rice shareholders are to receive slightly more than one-third of a share of EQT stock and $5.30 a share in cash, the companies said. The deal is expected to close toward the end of the year.

Rice, which focused on the Marcellus Shale in southwestern Pennsylvania and the Utica Shale just across the border in Ohio, drilled a 2014 gas well called Bigfoot 9H that by one measure ranks among the most successful in U.S. history.

It hit an initial production of 41.7 million cubic feet a day, enough to power every home in Pittsburgh for 36 hours.

Even after a year of other gushers in the Utica Shale, Bigfoot still ranked fifth among the most successful in that area at the end of 2015, putting it among the biggest onshore gushers in U.S. history at the time, according to Morgan Stanley.

Rice and EQT at times have been victims of their own success. The monster wells and rich reserves they have found in the Utica and the overlapping Marcellus added to a glut that was already severe, helping push prices to record lows as recently as last year.

EQT is based in Pittsburgh and focused on Appalachian-area natural-gas production, gathering and transmission, but it hasn't been able to move all the gas produced there for lack of pipeline capacity and has struggled with low prices for that output.

Rice's network will enable EQT to ship gas to markets in the Midwest and the Gulf, where it can fetch better prices.

Rice made its stock-market debut in January 2014 in an offering that valued the stake of its controlling Rice family at $900 million.

The stock's strong start fizzled that summer when oil prices began to fall, prompting a broad selloff in energy stocks, including those of U.S. gas producers.

Chief Executive Daniel Rice IV runs the company alongside younger brothers Toby and Derek, the company's chief operating officer and exploration head, respectively. A fourth brother, Ryan, joined in 2014 as a petroleum engineer.

Citigroup Inc. acted as financial adviser to EQT, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz acted as legal adviser. Barclays PLC acted as financial adviser to Rice Energy, and Vinson & Elkins LLP acted as legal adviser."
Ctit Group,Business News: Morgan Stanley Joins Robo-Advisory Era," Jun 17, 2017",0,"Morgan Stanley is rolling out a welcome mat for the investing masses, part of a push to get a foothold with a new generation of wealth-management clients.

Starting this fall, investors with as little as $5,000 can use the New York bank's robo-advisory service known as Morgan Stanley Access Investing, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

Since ramping up in wealth management several years ago with the acquisition of Citigroup Inc.'s Smith Barney brokerage, Morgan Stanley has pushed its brokers to meet the investing needs of individuals with millions of dollars. Now, the bank is in the midst of a digital transformation that will let the U.S.'s biggest brokerage by number of financial advisers embrace some of the country's smallest investors.

""These robo-advisory solutions make sense for that segment of the market that has frankly been traditionally underserved,"" said Naureen Hassan, Morgan Stanley's chief digital officer for wealth management, while speaking at Morgan Stanley's financials conference this past week.

Morgan Stanley told brokers on Thursday it would begin testing its robo service with a small group of employees in June, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Similar to other robos, Morgan Stanley's automated-investing service relies on an algorithm to gauge an investor's appetite for risk and then recommends an appropriate portfolio of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, according to the filing. The service, which will cost 0.45% of the invested assets annually, will also give investors the option to further customize their portfolios around certain themes, such as focusing on sustainable investments or other socially responsible investment themes.

Morgan Stanley is gearing the service initially toward people it already has a relationship with, such as the children of current clients or people who participate in employee stock-purchase plans administered by Morgan Stanley, Ms. Hassan said."
Ctit Group,"Streetwise: This Time, the Fed May Turn Out to Be Correct"," Jun 16, 2017",1,"There are two ways to trade the Fed. One is to look at what the Federal Reserve says, compare it with your own forecasts for inflation, growth, productivity and wages, and decide whether Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen was right to show a flicker of hawkishness on Wednesday. This is what almost every major fund manager does, investing huge amounts of time and effort in econometric analysis. Most is wasted.

The alternative is to look at the market's assumptions to see what's being ignored. Right now, it is the reflation trade, abandoned along with President Donald Trump's credibility on Wall Street.

After the election, investors bet big on Mr. Trump and the Republican Congress adopting growth-friendly tax cuts, spending boosts and cuts to red tape. The Fed, they thought, wouldn't derail growth. Since shortly after the Fed's mid-December rate increase, investors' assumptions have completely reversed. A divided Congress won't be able to do anything, the Fed might be making a mistake to tighten and inflation isn't just resting, it is in a coma.

The reverse of the reflation trade is visible in equities, bonds and the economy. How one feels about it depends on a critical shift by the Fed, from being ""data dependent"" -- backward looking -- to return to the traditional central-bank approach of setting policy according to what it expects to happen, not what's already happened.

The data on which the Fed no longer depends have indeed shown little of the dynamism needed to justify rate increases on a backward-looking basis. Wages have been rising fast in some sectors, but overall are growing only a little above inflation, despite unemployment well below the Fed's estimate of what counts as full employment (which Fed policy makers keep cutting, with the median estimate down again on Wednesday to 4.6%). Inflation remains stubbornly below the Fed's target. And economic data have been disappointing, with the most unpleasant surprises compared with forecasts in more than two years, according to a Citigroup index.

Yet, all this and more is now priced in. The bond market is priced for inflation over the next 10 years to average just 1.72%, now below both where it stood on election day and the Fed's 2% target. The 10-year Treasury yield is back down to where it was the day after the election, and on Wednesday its post-Fed rise wasn't enough to offset its drop in response to earlier disappointing inflation figures.

As a result, the closely watched gap between two-year and 10-year yields dropped below 0.8% for the first time since last summer's fears of deflation. In the past when it has fallen below zero, a recession has almost always followed.

Back in late November and December, I was skeptical that Mr. Trump could deliver enough to justify the huge run-up in cyclical stocks and bond yields, which seemed to be based on wild overexcitement from investors. Now those same investors expect the administration to achieve nothing and have returned to their pre-election gloom about the economy.

Investors should accept that they know far less about what's likely to happen to growth, wages and inflation than economists like to make out.

The Fed might turn out to be right this time, and wages and then inflation might pick up as job vacancies prove hard to fill. Further, the Republicans will surely soon realize that they have to pull together and pass something -- anything -- on taxes and red tape to avoid going into next year's midterm elections with nothing to show voters.

Economic and political analysis is worth trying. But the hurdle to success for the reflation trade is much lower, and the idea that Mrs. Yellen might be right this time is worth a punt."
Ctit Group,"Fed Lifts Rates, Readies Asset Cuts"," Jun 15, 2017",0,"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve said it would raise short-term interest rates and spelled out in greater detail its plans to start shrinking its $4.5 trillion portfolio of bonds and other assets this year.

The moves on Wednesday mark the latest test of the economy's ability to grow on its own as the central bank dials back the unprecedented stimulus measures it unleashed through successive bursts of bond purchases after the 2008 financial crisis.

""The economy is doing very well, is showing resilience,"" said Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen at a news conference following the Fed's two-day policy meeting.

The Fed said it would increase its benchmark federal-funds rate on Thursday by a quarter percentage point to a range between 1% and 1.25% and penciled in one more increase later this year if the economy performs in line with its forecast.

Together with the decision to raise interest rates, the balance-sheet plans show confidence in the economic expansion, which has been unspectacular but is also the third-longest on record.

""We should want the Fed to raise rates because it signals something good about the underlying economy,"" said Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at Citigroup. ""When it gets overheated and the Fed has to cut if off, that's when you get worried.""

Markets were little changed after the expected moves. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 46.09 points, or 0.2%, to a fresh high of 21374.56. The S&P 500 fell 2.43 points, or 0.1%, to 2437.92.

Wednesday's decisions mark a new chapter for the Fed and Ms. Yellen, whose tenure has been defined by meticulous plans to slowly drain reservoirs of stimulus that she and other Fed leaders forcefully advocated in response to the financial crisis that deepened the 2007-09 recession.

Ms. Yellen's tenure as Fed chairwoman began in early 2014, as the Fed began to slow its purchases of Treasury and mortgage securities, the conclusion of the latest -- and broadest -- effort to spur household and business investment by pushing down long-term interest rates.

The Fed stopped adding to its holdings, also known as its balance sheet, in October 2014, but it has continued to reinvest the proceeds of maturing assets to maintain the portfolio's size. Since then, central bankers in Europe and Japan have ramped up similar bond-buying experiments.

""The Fed has done a tremendous job helping the economy grind its way out of an extremely deep and disruptive recession,"" said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays and a former Fed economist.

Plans revealed by the Fed on Wednesday would start reducing the central bank's holdings gradually by allowing a small amount of net maturities every month. It would start by allowing up to $6 billion in Treasury securities and $4 billion in mortgage bonds to roll off without reinvestment, and let those amounts rise each quarter, essentially setting a speed limit for the wind-down.

The limits would ultimately rise to a maximum of $30 billion a month for Treasurys and $20 billion a month for mortgage-backed securities.

Ms. Yellen said if the economy performed in line with the central bank's forecasts, the Fed could set those plans into motion ""relatively soon,"" which market strategists believe could mean September or October.

Officials have taken pains to communicate their strategy in advance to avoid a rerun of the 2013 ""taper tantrum,"" when investor concerns over the Fed's decision to slow down asset purchases triggered market turmoil, including a sharp increase in Treasury yields and capital outflows from emerging markets.

""The plan is one that is consciously intended to avoid creating market strains and to allow the market to adjust to a very gradual and predictable plan,"" Ms. Yellen said Wednesday.

Allowing some of the holdings to mature without reinvestment could push up long-term rates. The Fed has been buying around $24 billion in mortgage securities a month this year and around $17.5 billion in Treasurys, according to FTN Financial.

The Fed said all participants at its policy-setting meeting had agreed with the balance-sheet plans. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari cast the lone dissenting vote on Wednesday's decision to raise rates because he wanted to hold them steady.

Since officials last met in early May, they have faced conflicting signals about the economy on two items that matter most: employment and inflation. Solid job gains have pulled down the unemployment rate to lower-than-expected levels, at 4.3% in May, but inflation has unexpectedly slowed.

Ms. Yellen said officials are ""monitoring inflation developments closely,"" but warned against reading too much into recent one-off declines in consumer prices, such as wireless-phone plans, that have weighed on inflation gauges.

Fed officials marked down their projections for inflation this year, though they still see annual price gains reaching their 2% target by the end of 2018, in part because they expect tighter labor markets to ultimately help firm up prices.

Officials' median expectation for the federal-funds rate showed few changes from projections released in March, and implies three more quarter-point increases in 2018 and three more in 2019."
Ctit Group,Uber Picks 14 Bosses To Run Company," Jun 15, 2017",1,"The decision by Uber Technologies Inc.'s chief executive to take an indefinite leave of absence will put management of the world's most valuable startup in the collective hands of more than a dozen managers -- a challenging structure for a company that has favored a strong central leader and pitted executives against each other.

The ride-hailing firm said it would turn the company reins over to a group of 14 senior executives while CEO Travis Kalanick regroups following a punishing half-year of scandals and setbacks, capped by the death of his mother in a boating accident that left his father seriously hurt.

The recent exits of Mr. Kalanick's effective second-in-command, Emil Michael, and the previous deputy, Jeff Jones, and of several other direct reports to the CEO have left Uber with no real line of succession.

The company now has made the unusual choice of having Uber run by the heads oflegal, human resources, communications, products, operations and other units.

""A committee is very implausible,"" said Joseph Bower, a Harvard Business School professor emeritus of business administration. ""You can't make decisions that way.""

Mr. Kalanick, in his note to staff announcing his leave, said ""I will be available as needed for the most strategic decisions, but I will be empowering [the committee] to be bold and decisive in order to move the company forward swiftly.""

An Uber spokesman said the company has ""a strong leadership team including veterans who helped make the business what it is today, and new talent who are helping to drive the changes we're committed to making.""

Uber has been grappling with accusations of sexism and sexual harassment and on Tuesday rolled out reforms to upend its workplace culture after a monthslong investigation led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.

Adding to the complexity, the company is seeking a laundry list of executives, including chief operating and chief financial officers, general counsel and a marketing chief. Board Director David Bonderman stepped aside Tuesday after making a sexist remark during a company all-hands meeting. There is little precedent for Uber's transition of power in the corporate world.

""If your bet is that Travis will come back, you want to show that you're his man or woman,"" said Sydney Finkelstein, a management professor at Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College and author of ""Superbosses: How Exceptional Leaders Master the Flow of Talent.""

The history of business successes where rule is split between more than a single CEO is spotty. Oracle Corp. has been operating with co-CEOs since 2014 when Larry Ellison relinquished the top job -- the stock is up about 13% since then -- and Samsung Electronics Co. remains the top global seller of smartphones by market share under three CEOs.

At other companies, the results have been less stellar. BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd. battled investor discontent for years over its co-CEO structure and ultimately put in a single leader, though the business still plunged into irrelevance.

Similar co-CEO arrangements at Citigroup Inc., Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. and Workday Inc. were quickly scuttled.

Last year, Whole Foods Market Inc., too, eliminated the co-CEO structure after six years. Amazon.com Inc.'s Zappos unit has been experimenting with an unusual management philosophy called Holacracy, in which titles and bosses are eliminated, since 2013. But the structure sowed confusion and when the shoe seller offered severance in 2015 for those who wanted to quit, 14% took the offer.

Rarer still are firms led by committee. Watch and jewelry maker Cie. Financiere Richemont SA has been operating without a CEO since Richard Lepeu stepped down in March.

Top executives report into the chairman and decisions are made by consensus. DPR Construction has senior leaders rotate through an eight-member management committee. Employees at those firms have said committees can sometimes make decisions painstaking and cause infighting.

At Uber, the transition will be particularly tricky since Mr. Kalanick has structured the San Francisco company to funnel big day-to-day decisions through him, say people familiar with the matter.

Mr. Kalanick, known for his relentless and punishing will to win, was also reluctant to be challenged as CEO and could lash out at what he felt was insubordination, these people say.

Uber said it would divide the management committee into four units: business; people and organization; product and engineering; and legal safety and policy and communications.

The 14 executives include Rachel Holt, Andrew MacDonald and Pierre Dimitri Gore-Coty, the heads of operations in the U.S. and Canada; Latin America and Asia Pacific; and Europe, Middle East and Africa, respectively.

Also included are Ryan Graves, the first Uber CEO, a board member and senior vice president of operations; CTO Thuan Pham; Chief Security Officer Joe Sullivan; communications and policy chief Jill Hazelbaker; product-management head Daniel Graf; chief of self-driving vehicle development Eric Meyhofer; product leader Jeff Holden; HR boss Liane Hornsey; and Chief Legal Officer Salle Yoo.

The group also includes two new additions to upper management at Uber: David Richter, who was promoted just this week to fill Mr. Michael's role, and recent hire from Harvard Business School, Frances Frei, a senior vice president of leadership and strategy.

Mr. Finkelstein of Dartmouth said he expects two or three managers to rise to the top of Uber's new committee of leaders, and that there may be a division in the company's top ranks between those who support Mr. Kalanick's vision for the startup, and those who prefer to steer it in new directions.

""The ones that campaign to bring him back, or discretely seek his advice, may see an opportunity to take over while the CEO is in the penalty box,"" he said."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp; Finance: Lawsuit Links Deal to Malaysian Scandal --- U.S. alleges that funds stolen from 1MDB were used to finance purchase of energy firm," Jun 13, 2017",1,"U.S. authorities are investigating the $2.2 billion purchase of a U.S. energy company by a Middle Eastern government investment fund that was arranged by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and netted one investor a $300 million windfall in less than a week, according to a government lawsuit and people familiar with the investigation.

Investigators allege that the investor was an important player in the scandal involving Malaysian government-investment fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd., or 1MDB. Goldman earned hundreds of millions in fees arranging $6.5 billion worth of bond deals for 1MDB.

Investigators in the U.S. and other countries have said several billion dollars was misappropriated from 1MDB.

The U.S. Justice Department, in an asset seizure lawsuit dated Wednesday, provided detailed allegations that in 2013 and 2014 funds allegedly stolen from 1MDB were funneled via a series of bank accounts and shell companies to partly finance the purchase of Coastal Energy, a Houston firm controlled at the time by legendary Texas oilman Oscar Wyatt Jr. The lawsuit seeks to seize proceeds from the Coastal deal, but not Coastal assets.

The Coastal deal involved many people believed by investigators to be involved in the alleged schemes to defraud 1MDB: The buyer was a joint venture between a company owned by Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund International Petroleum Investment Co., or IPIC, and a shell company controlled by Jho Low, a Malaysian financier, according to the Justice Department asset seizure lawsuit. Goldman advised the IPIC unit that paid nearly all of the purchase price.

Last summer, the Justice Department filed a $1 billion asset seizure lawsuit against properties controlled by senior executives of IPIC and against Mr. Low. In a complaint dated Wednesday, the Justice Department expanded the lawsuit to include property in London allegedly purchased with money it claims was taken from 1MDB and fraudulently washed by Mr. Low and his family through the purchase of Coastal Energy.

Mr. Low, who was being informally advised by Goldman at the time, first approached Coastal in 2012 about a possible acquisition, people familiar with the matter said. Skeptical that Mr. Low could come up with the cash necessary, Coastal executives told him to find a bigger partner, a person familiar with the matter said. He returned with IPIC's Spanish energy unit, Compania Espanola de Petroleos SAU, or Cepsa, the people said.

Mr. Low invested $50 million in the deal, with Cespa funding the remainder of the $2.2 billion purchase, according to the Justice Department lawsuit and statements announcing the acquisition.

One week later, Cepsa transferred $350 million to Mr. Low's shell company, according to the lawsuit. ""The commercial basis for this nearly immediate 600% return on investment is not immediately apparent,"" the Justice Department lawsuit said. IPIC and Cepsa didn't respond to requests for comment.

Before an agreement with the U.S. energy company could be reached, Goldman's compliance department told its bankers to stop working with Mr. Low or his entity on the deal, citing concern over Mr. Low's wealth, people familiar with the matter said. Goldman recently had turned down a request by Mr. Low to open a private bank account for the same reason, according to the people.

Mr. Low remained a participant, though, through a shell company called Strategic Resources (Global) Ltd, according to deal documents. Goldman advised Cepsa, which was paying nearly all of the deal's purchase price, according to the complaint, merger documents and statements announcing the deal. PricewaterhouseCoopers was a financial adviser to both Cepsa and SRG. PricewaterhouseCoopers declined to comment.

Goldman said in a statement that neither Mr. Low nor any firm controlled by him was a Goldman client in the Coastal deal. ""Prior to reading the government filing, Goldman was not aware of, and had no involvement in, any transaction in which SRG sold its stake in a joint venture back to Cepsa,"" the firm said.

Goldman had roughly $600 million in revenue from 1MBD in 2012 and 2013 for selling $6.5 billion in bonds. Much of the money raised by Goldman was taken out of 1MDB by Mr. Low and IPIC executives and used to purchase mansions, pay gambling debt and fund a Hollywood movie company, the Justice Department lawsuits claim. Goldman has also said it has no knowledge of any fraud at 1MDB.

A January 2014 press release issued by Coastal Energy, Cepsa and SRG announcing the deal's completion referred to Strategic Resources as a firm controlled by Mr. Low's father, Larry Low. When executives and advisers met for dinner to mark the deal's close, Szen Low, Mr. Low's brother, joined the celebration, one person said.

Jho Low, whose whereabouts are unclear, has denied wrongdoing. 1MDB has consistently denied wrongdoing and said it would cooperate with the investigations. The Justice Department lawsuit cited Mr. Low as saying Cepsa bought out his stake because it ""wanted full control and ownership of the business.""

The Justice Department is interested in the Coastal deal because it says the $50 million Mr. Low invested originally came from 1MDB. The Justice Department on Tuesday moved to seize London property that it says was bought with some of the $350 million proceeds of the Coastal deal. The Justice Department has questioned people involved in the deal in recent months, according to people familiar with the investigation.

Coastal was represented in the deal by Citigroup Inc., which advised its clients to tread carefully, one person said. The $2.2 billion purchase price for Coastal Energy was at a 28% premium to the company's stock price, earning Mr. Wyatt more than $500 million for his quarter stake in the company. An attorney for Mr. Wyatt didn't return calls seeking comment. A Citi spokeswoman had no immediate comment."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp; Finance: Goldman's Green Push Comes With Trading Twist," Jun 13, 2017",1,"A wind farm in Scranton, Pa., sitting over ancient coal seams, will soon power Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s data centers in New Jersey.

The Wall Street bank said Monday that it has agreed to buy 68 megawatts of electricity from the plant, which will come online in 2019. It is the first such agreement struck by a bank, according to trade group Business Renewables Center, and pushes Goldman closer to its goal of procuring 100% of the energy it uses from renewable sources by 2020.

The deal is Goldman's effort to stake a claim in a hot corner of the energy-trading market and to try to catch up with rivals.

Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley are already big in the renewables-trading segment. Goldman recently hired a Citigroup trader, Moe Hanifi, who will join Harry Singh and Joram Cukierman in spearheading the firm's effort.

Commodities trading has been a tough business across Wall Street since the financial crisis due to stricter capital rules.

It was among the businesses that Goldman blamed for disappointing trading revenue last quarter.

Goldman won't just be in the renewables market for its own needs. The firm's commodities arm has been building a business to connect corporate buyers of electricity with developers. That group, reporting to commodities chief Greg Agran, will manage the 15-year electricity contract, protecting Goldman from price swings, grid congestion and other risks.

It hopes to market that same service to a group of companies that are striking their own power agreements, Mr. Agran said in an interview.

The market for such deals has increased from next to nothing in 2012 to 1.5 gigawatts last year, according to the Business Renewables Center.

Large technology firms such as Apple Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. were early and remain the biggest players. But they have been joined by the likes of Anheuser-Busch InBev NV and General Motors Co.

As wind and solar prices continue to fall, demand is likely to increase. The catch: ""What developers want to sell and what these companies want to buy doesn't always match up,"" Mr. Agran said.

Goldman hopes to stand in the middle. The firm's traders, for example, can use derivatives to transform short-term contracts that companies typically want into 20- or 25-year terms that developers prefer. Goldman also can aggregate orders from smaller companies or buy big slugs of power from developers and syndicate it to many buyers.

Goldman's traders are working with the firm's investment bankers to drum up interest from corporate clients, Mr. Agran said.

The Scranton project, which is being developed by NextEra Energy Inc., will produce power equivalent to Goldman's usage across its North American facilities, said Cindy Quan, who runs the bank's real estate sustainability efforts. Goldman gets 90% of its power from green sources, mostly by buying credits created by other projects.

Ctit Group,"Markets &amp; Finance: Goldman, Citi Bosses Duped by Email Prankster"," Jun 13, 2017",1,"The chief executives of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. are the latest bank bosses to be hooked by an email prankster trolling top Wall Street brass,exposing a low-tech gap in banks' cybersecurity armor.

Goldman's Lloyd Blankfein and Citigroup's Michael Corbat, as well as Citigroup consumer-banking chief Stephen Bird, responded over the weekend to emails sent by the anonymous prankster masquerading as top executives at the two banks.

The hoaxer, who last month snared Barclays PLC chief Jes Staley and Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney, on Sunday published screenshots of the exchanges on Twitter. Goldman and Citigroup confirmed the email exchanges.

None of the executives disclosed sensitive information in responding to the prankster, but the repeated episodes flag concerns about whether banks have done enough toguard against online threats. It comes as more trading is happening on mobile devices and investment bankers are taking electronic pitch-books on the road.

The emails mimic a well-known scam known as ""phishing."" In this, scammers try to get victims to click on malicious links or try to capture sensitive information, such as passwords, via seemingly innocuous emails. These emails can take the form of invoices from customers, shared Google documents, or phony password-reset requests.

Last year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it had observed a 270% increase in business-email scams over a 15-month period. In these, criminals had impersonated executives to request a fraudulent money transfer or other fraudulent transaction. Between October 2013 and February 2016, law-enforcement officials received reports from 17,642 victims of this kind of scheme that amounted to more than $2.3 billion in losses.

The anonymous bank trickster so far has appeared to seek to embarrass executives rather than extract secrets or plant viruses.

The fear, though, is that if bankers can fall for cheeky pranksters, they might also fall victim to the kinds of phishing attacks that hackers used to breach the Democratic National Committee's email, enabled by a false email asking to reset a password.

Mr. Blankfein received an email that appeared to be from a top lieutenant, Harvey Schwartz. The prankster appeared to be looking for confirmation that a pair of recent tweets from Mr. Blankfein were a swipe at President Donald Trump's infrastructure agenda.

""Tweet won some online award for humorous tweet -- Trump will be so pissed ;),"" it read, according to the screenshots published on Twitter.

Mr. Blankfein largely declined to take the bait. He said that the tweet ""seemed like a good way to bookend my trip,"" though he did say he would ""settle for getting away with it.""

Messrs. Corbat and Bird received emails appearing to come from Citigroup Chairman Michael O'Neill.

Mr. Corbat sent only a brief response, while Mr. Bird traded a series of emails with the prankster. The emails were personal in nature and didn't pertain to business dealings of the banks or their financial workings.

""CEOs are trying to be hands-on these days, tweeting and emailing and responding to many things themselves,"" said Sandeep Kumar, managing director for capital markets at Synechron, an information-technology consulting firm. ""These firms have many layers of security and filtering. . . . But at times, emails will sneak in and somebody will be tempted to click on a wrong link or respond to someone they shouldn't.""

Many bankers, including those at Citigroup, access their email through third-party security applications such as those developed by Good Technology, now part of BlackBerry Ltd.Those apps screen links when they are clicked and block many of them. Mr. Corbat, in his response to the prankster, noted that he couldn't open the link."
Ctit Group,Currency Declines Lose Export Punch --- U.K. is test of how global supply chains lessen gains from devaluations," Jun 12, 2017",1,"For decades, economics textbooks argued that suddenly weaker currencies are a boon to growth, because they make a country's exports more competitive or profitable on the global stage, which in turn boosts domestic production and employment.

What if that theory no longer holds?

Economists and government officials are increasingly wondering if that effect is diminishing, especially among advanced Western economies with shrinking manufacturing capacity and supply chains increasingly interwoven with the rest of the world. The new idea is that much of the benefit from a falling currency is offset by the higher prices paid for components imported from overseas.

The U.K. is emerging as a test case for whether globalization has diminished the effect. Although its currency has been battered by the financial crisis, the Brexit vote to leave the European Union -- which took place a year ago June 23 -- and the country's fresh bout of political uncertainty, its exporting power hasn't responded as textbooks might suggest.

Chemicals made at Chemoxy International Ltd.'s factory in Middlesbrough are worth about 20% more in the export market after last June's fall in sterling, given the beefed-up value of the currencies used to buy those goods overseas. Higher costs for imported materials, however, all but erased that advantage.

""We have a huge interdependency on international markets,"" says Chemoxy Chief Executive Ian Stark. The company exports more than 60% of its products and imports about 85% of its chemical raw materials. A weakerpound, he says, ""isn't revolutionary.""

British businesses ranging from car makers to food processors to lumber mills are discovering the same thing.

Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and a member of the Bank of England's rate-setting monetary policy committee between 2009 and 2012, says the effects of currency moves on exports have faded over time. After the financial crisis in 2008, a big sterling depreciation didn't result in the pickup in exports ""we would have expected,"" he says.

""You just don't get as much bang for your pound as you used to,"" said Mr. Posen.

Whether or how the relationship between a currency's strength and economic growth still holds has ramifications for international politics. In the U.S., manufacturers have long complained about the impact of a strong dollar. President Donald Trump has accused Japan and China of keeping their currencies artificially low, hampering U.S. exports.

In 1992, the pound fell by around 11% between September and the end of that year after the U.K. crashed out of the European exchange rate mechanism -- a precursor to the euro that required a stronger pound than the government could sustain. The U.K. economy then went on an export tear, which turned a trade deficit into a five-year surplus and jump-started a recovery.

Thepoundfell by nearly 25% against the currencies of its major trading partners between 2007 and 2010 and never recovered, sparking optimism in government that exports would rise. In 2012, then-U.K. Treasury chief George Osborne targeted an increase in exports to GBP 1 trillion by 2020, from GBP 499 billion that year. By the end of 2016, exports had risen to just GBP 547 billion.

When the currency took another beating after the Brexit vote, the impact was similarly muted. Car maker Aston Martin, which exports 80% of its vehicles, helps show why. Before Brexit, when the pound traded at $1.50, sports cars sold in New York for $150,000 would bring home GBP 100,000. With the pound now at $1.27, such sales bring an extra GBP 18,000. But over half the car's components must be bought from abroad, blunting the effect.

""During the past decade, a lot of auto suppliers have moved offshore,"" says Aston Martin Chief Executive Andy Palmer. ""In consequence, you don't get the benefits.""

In recent months, sterling has recovered from its post Brexit lows and is currently down 15% against the dollar and 13% against the euro. Analysts remain pessimistic about the currency as Britain heads for divorce from its largest trading partner, the European Union.

The pound fell 1.7% on Friday after Prime Minister Theresa May's ruling Conservative Party failed to secure enough seats in a snap general election to alone form a government.

Global economists are debating how much exchange rates affect trade for developed nations. Two recent papers, from the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, found movements in exchange rates had a declining impact on trade in several advanced economies.

The OECD paper said a plunge of sterling in 2008 and the yen's decline against the dollar in 2012 had little impact on trade. The study said evidence suggested companies had become more embedded in global supply chains. Between 1995 and 2011, the import content of exports rose from 14.9% to 24.3% among OECD nations.

In May, the Bank for International Settlements published new mathematical modelsfor estimatingreal effective exchange rates, one measure of the strength of a currency. It said without taking into account deep global supply chains, standard exchange-rate models ""are increasingly becoming obsolete.""

Other economists have resisted the idea, including a team at the International Monetary Fund, which came to a different conclusion and found ""little evidence of a weakening in the effects of exchange rates over time.""

In its analysis, the IMF suggests a significant currency depreciation -- where currencies weaken by at least 13% in advanced economies, or 20% in emerging ones -- results in a 10% rise in export volumes over five years.

The IMF had some caveats. The paper argues the impact of a weaker currency is strongest when the economy isn't running at full capacity, for example following a recession. It also suggests that financial crises dent companies' ability to take advantage of a depreciation, because of the lack of available credit.

""In general, however"" the authors conclude, ""the role of flexible exchange rates in facilitating the resolution of trade imbalances remains significant.""

Since Britain's vote to leave the EU, consumers abroad have been buying more British products. In the six months through April, the most recent month for which the U.K.'s Office for National Statistics has published data, goods export volumes increased 3.1% from the year-earlier period. Over that same period, import volumes rose even more, by 4.9%.

For some exporters such as Scotland's whisky industry, the pound's fall has been pure good news because most of what goes into a bottle of whisky is produced locally. The Scotch Whisky Association says exports increased 4% last year to over GBP 4 billion.

Most U.K. manufacturing industries, however, can no longer rely on domestic supply chains. In 2015, manufacturing represented 9.8% of the U.K.'s gross domestic product, down from 14.7% in 2000. In the U.S., by comparison, manufacturing represented 12.3% of the GDP in 2015, and 15.5% in 2000.

As U.K. manufacturing declined, service industries grew and now are responsible for 79% of GDP. Those industries are less sensitive to changes in exchange rates. In the services sector, the U.K. runs a trade surplus that grew to 5.4% of GDP at the end of last year. For London's huge financial sector, sterling's tumble has little benefit because business is often denominated in other currencies and demand for service industries tends to be less price sensitive.

Trade in goods, however, is an entirely different story. The U.K. deficit in that area has ballooned from 1.6% of GDP in 1995to 6.4% last year. It has kept rising despite imports becoming more expensive and exports more competitive. This year's goods deficit, through April, is GBP 42.8 billion, excluding oil and particularly volatile items such as aircraft.

Some economists have long been skeptical of the idea that trade can be shifted by currency depreciation in the longer term. As a currency weakens, the price of imported goods rises, raising inflation. Also, they say, structural problems, such as weak productivity and competitiveness, are often causes of trade deficits, which depreciation cannot address and may even prevent a country from tackling.

""Don't believe that Britain is going to depreciate itself out of its current account imbalances,"" says Willem Buiter, chief economist at Citigroup Inc. and a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee.

To make matters worse, Britain has become so reliant on imports to stock its stores that a weaker pound has increased inflation, making life more expensive and curbing consumer spending.

Britain now imports more than 60% of its fish. The pound's fall triggered a 15% overnight jump in prices for the crates of cod and haddock that Mike Woods buys from the docks of Grimsby, in northern England. That cost his food processing company, Albert Darnell Ltd., an additional GBP 15,000 a week.

Like other food manufacturers, Mr. Woods is passing on that increased cost to consumers. Fish and chips have become more expensive at the St. James Fish Restaurant in the center of Grimsby. ""We get people complaining now,"" says waitress Eve Barrow.

While more expensive imports should present opportunities for British manufacturers and suppliers to step in, it will take time for industry to adjust.

Around 80% of the timber used in U.K. construction is imported, mainly from Scandinavia, according to the Timber Trade Federation. It isn't easy for Britain's construction industry, which is responsible for around 7% of GDP, to shift quickly to domestic suppliers.

Keith Ainslie of James Jones & Sons Ltd, the U.K.'s largest sawmill, says the company's main plant in Lockerbie, Scotland, is already ""working full tilt."" Processing more logs would mean building another sawmill, a roughly GBP 60 million project that would take around three years to get up and running."
Ctit Group,A Turnaround Brews at Citigroup," Jun 9, 2017",1,"Citigroup, the last truly cheap major bank in the U.S., is approaching two key turning points that should help its shares close in on a better valuation.

The major overhang for the bank is excess capital. Its common-equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.8% is significantly higher than the three other largest U.S. banks. A ratio of around 11.5% would be sufficient to keep it comfortably above regulatory minimums.

These high levels of capital in turn drag down its return on equity, which at 7.4% in the first quarter remains decidedly subpar. This helps explain why the bank trades at just 0.8 times book value, compared with an average 1.2 times for its three closest peers.

The Federal Reserve holds the key to solving this problem through the annual stress tests, which determine how much capital banks can return to shareholders. Following last year's test, Citigroup announced that it would return $10.4 billion to shareholders over four quarters starting in the third quarter of 2016. It later raised this amount to $12.2 billion. That still falls well short of the roughly $15 billion of net profit that Citigroup is likely to have earn-ed over the period, meaning excess capital is still accruing.

The latest stress-test results will be announced in late June, and investors are expecting to see a significant increase in Citigroup's dividends and share buybacks. If the company can start paying out more than it earns, as appears likely, it will start the process of reducing the excess capital.

Coincidentally, Citigroup's aggressive expansion of credit-card lending is expected to start paying off around the same time, in the second half of this year. The bank began rolling out new cards in the middle of 2015 and said at the time that it would take around two years for them to become profitable as borrowers start to build up balances and pay interest.

Separately, Citigroup acquired American Express's Costco credit-card business in June 2016. It initially had to book provisions for losses on existing loans, but gave guidance indicating that the portfolio would start contributing to the bottom line in the second half of 2017.

The risk, of course, is that defaults could be higher than expected, especially on its $44 billion portfolio of cards issued in partnership with retailers, which target less-creditworthy borrowers. Given recent signs that consumers are getting overstretched on auto and student loans, this risk bears watching in the quarters ahead.

Nonetheless, the overall picture at Citigroup is of a bank finally turning the page on lingering issues. America's cheapest major bank looks like a good bet."
Ctit Group,U.S. News: Sessions Orders Settlement Change," Jun 8, 2017",1,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered prosecutors to stop settling corporate-wrongdoing cases by requiring companies to make donations to third-party groups, a feature of some Obama-era bank settlements congressional Republicans had opposed.

In a one-page memo dated Monday and released on Wednesday, Mr. Sessions told Justice Department officials they could no longer include any provision in a civil or criminal settlement ""that directs or provides for a payment or loan to any non-governmental person or entity that is not a party to the dispute.""

The Justice Department used the practice in several settlements after the financial crisis that resolved allegations that banks misled investors on shoddy mortgage-backed securities, including a $7 billion accord with Citigroup Inc. and a $17 billion settlement with Bank of America Corp., both in 2014.

Most of those settlements were in the form of penalties paid to the U.S. Treasury and reduced loan balances for struggling borrowers, but they also included tens of millions of dollars in payments to housing-counseling groups approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and to state-based legal-aid groups.

Bank of America, for example, was required to pay $50 million to community-development funds certified by the Treasury Department, $30 million to state accounts that helped low-income people with legal issues and $20 million to housing-counseling groups.

Republicans blasted the arrangement as a ""slush fund"" that directed money to Democratic interest groups and said the donations undermined congressional budget authority. The House of Representatives approved a bill at the end of the last congressional session in September to limit the practice.

Obama administration officials have defended the third-party donations as consistent with well-established practice and said the recipients were helping victims of the banks' conduct avoid foreclosures.

The new policy only applies to future cases but likely wouldn't have allowed the Justice Department to require Volkswagen AG to invest $2 billion in a network of U.S. electric-vehicle charging stations, according to a person familiar with the policy.

VW was required to make the investment as part of a settlement reached with civil and criminal authorities in the waning days of the Obama administration, in which the German auto maker admitted to cheating on emissions tests. Some state officials and auto makers have said the VW provision resembles a government-backed windfall more than a penalty."
Ctit Group,Benchmark Gives a Go Signal to Fed --- Measure of money markets' health shows central bank has the leeway to raise rates," Jun 7, 2017",0,"A measure that tracks stress in U.S. money markets tumbled to near its lowest level in seven years, a sign of loose financial conditions that could help prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next week.

The three-month dollar Libor-OIS spread -- the difference between the rate at which banks lend to each other and the market's expectations of central bank rates -- fell below 0.1 percentage point on Monday and remained there on Tuesday, at 0.0974 percentage point, the lowest since August 2015, according to Steven Zeng, interest-rate strategist at Deutsche Bank AG. The spread's lowest level in recent years was in March 2010, when it hit 0.06 percentage point.

As markets fret over whether the Fed will raise short-term borrowing rates too quickly, potentially constraining growth in the economy, the narrowing Libor-OIS spread is one indication that the U.S. central bank has the latitude to stay on its course of raising interest rates. The Fed lifted rates in December and March and is expected to act again at its June 13-14 meeting.

Some other indicators in financial markets, including lower Treasury yields, higher stocks and a weaker dollar, also point to loose financial conditions.

Tracking the Libor-OIS spread (London interbank offered rate and overnight index swap) helps investors and policy makers monitor the health of money markets. A higher reading signals increasing stress, while a lower one indicates easy funding conditions. The gauge soared to a record in October 2008 as banks lost trust in each other and money markets seized up.

To some analysts, the narrowing spread reflects the easy monetary policies that still dominate financial markets and could breed complacency in investors. The Fed has been raising rates only gradually, and the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have continued bond-buying programs to stimulate their economies. Prices of assets from stocks to leveraged loans to bitcoin to gold have risen in the meantime.

""The problem for the Fed is that despite its rate increases, market signals remain unresponsive, potentially generating financial asset bubbles,"" said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short-rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and a former trader and analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Ample liquidity also offers an explanation of why Treasurys have strengthened this year alongside a roaring stock market, a shift from late last year when bonds sold off as shares rallied.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note settled at 2.147% Tuesday, its lowest level this year and down from 2.609% in mid-March. Yields fall when bond prices rise.

But to many others, the narrowing Libor-OIS difference is more a byproduct of postcrisis banking regulations and the money-market overhaul that kicked in during October. Continued thirst among investors for income in a low-yield world has also contributed to the narrowing spread.

The banking system is more resilient because of the regulations since 2008, as firms shifted away from short-term borrowings without collateral, which have interest rates tied to Libor. Instead, banks are issuing longer-term debt as a way to reduce rollover risk, that is, the threat from having to replace maturing debt.

""The risk is that funding would run away for the banks in time of market stress,"" said Steve Kang, an interest-rate strategist at Citigroup Inc. ""Less reliance on short-term funding means more stable funding for banks, and there is still lots of liquidity in the system.""

One form of short-term corporate debt has fallen to roughly half of where it was 10 years ago. U.S. commercial paper outstanding stood at $987 billion as of May 24, data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis show. The amount topped $2 trillion in 2007.

The Libor-OIS compression has also been driven by the return of stability in U.S. money-market funds that focus on riskier instruments, which are called prime money-market funds. New money-market fund regulation that became effective in October caused investors to move money into funds perceived as safer, spurring large outflows from prime money-market funds.

But in the past few months, prime money-market funds have attracted money again, highlighting a global demand for yield. Investors get higher yields on commercial paper relative to Treasury bills, or government debt maturing in a year or less.

""Everyone is starving for yields, chasing different assets,"" said Jim Madison, money-market trader at Manulife Asset Management.

Prime funds' total assets stood at $609 billion at the end of April, according to data from the Securities and Exchange Commission. That is down from $1.7 trillion a year earlier, but the amount was the highest since September.

The Treasury's move to pay down a large chunk of Treasury bills this year linked to the looming debt ceiling was also equivalent to cash injections into global markets. Investors who received the cash needed a new home to invest, adding to the scramble for yields and compressing the Libor-OIS spread further, say some analysts.

Still, investors should expect the Libor-OIS spread to widen from the current extreme levels if the Fed continues to tighten policy, said Jerome Schneider, head of the short-term and funding desk at Pacific Investment Management Co. ""Investors should be preparing to embrace higher benchmark rates in the coming months and find ways to be defensive of interest-rate risk while earning income,"" he said."
Ctit Group,Markets &amp; Finance: Trump Set To Nominate Otting for Comptroller," Jun 6, 2017",0,"WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump will nominate Joseph Otting as comptroller of the currency, a post overseeing federally chartered banks, the White House said Monday.

The move, if approved by the Senate, would place a former banker in a key role as the Trump team reviews financial regulatory policies.

The confirmation process could take months. Mr. Otting had previously been reported as a candidate for the job and would replace Keith Noreika, the acting comptroller. The Trump administration installed Mr. Noreika about a month ago to replace former President Barack Obama's comptroller.

Not much is known about Mr. Otting's regulatory views. But he is expected to adopt a similar tone to other Trump administration officials, who have called for a review of banking rules they say went too far under Mr. Obama and are curbing legitimate lending.

The comptroller oversees most of the largest federally chartered U.S. banks, including Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp; Finance: Citigroup Adds a Quant Trader," Jun 5, 2017",1,"Citigroup Inc. has tapped a quantitative trading veteran to help the bank vault into that hot category, as part of a broader build-up of its equities unit.

Thomas Chippas will join as global head of quantitative execution, the bank said Friday.

Mr. Chippas previously led quant-trading units at Barclays PLC and Deutsche Bank AG, before leaving for jobs beyond Wall Street, most recently as chief operating officer of blockchain-technology startup Axoni Inc.

The return to Wall Street for someone who left to work at a tech startup is an indication of the growing importance of the highly complex and tech-heavy ""quant"" style of trading. Banks are trying to keep up with clients who are increasingly shifting away from fundamental trading strategies to ones dictated by data and patterns. The shift comes as banks' equity trading desks have struggled with low volatility and a growing emphasis on low-cost forms ofpassive trading.

""I would categorize the environment as being okay, but low volatility,"" Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said an at industry conference Thursday, echoing other bank chief executives who were expecting a dip in trading revenue in the second quarter.

The pressure led banks across Wall Street to invest in quant trading and prime brokerage, which provides technology and financing for clients.

Citigroup in particular has said that despite the tough environment for stock trading, it believes it can sharply grow its market share -- which has lagged behind peers in recent years -- in large part byinvesting in prime brokerage, which also provides clearing services for complex quant trading.

""We called ourselves out a few years ago"" for being too small in equities, Mr. Corbat said Thursday. ""I think you've seen us continually taking revenue share.""

Citigroup's first quarter equity revenue rose 10% from a year ago, versus smaller gains or falls among its larger rivals.

Mr. Chippas will oversee the global expansion of systems that allow hedge funds and asset managers to rapidly put on or take off trades based on quantitative signals, known as ""low-latency execution,"" the bank said. He will report both to the head of cash trading and the head of prime finance.

Such quant trading is ""critical in continuing the momentum of our prime and equities businesses,"" saidAdam Herrmann, Citigroup's global head of prime finance."
Ctit Group,"Banking &amp; Finance: AmEx to Issue Hilton Cards Alone --- Company will become the single issuer for the hotelier, muscling out Citigroup"," Jun 2, 2017",1,"American Express Co. has won the rights to become the exclusive issuer of Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. credit cards, according to executives of both companies,a much-needed victory for the card issuer.

The deal ends a long-held arrangement in which AmEx and Citigroup Inc. had each issued the hotel's credit cards. Hilton more than a year ago had opened a bidding process for exclusive rights to its cards and decided to move to a single issuer.

AmEx will become the sole issuer of the Hilton Honors cards in the U.S. beginning in January 2018, according to both companies. This is a boost for AmEx, which has lost several card partnerships since 2015, including Costco Wholesale Corp., JetBlue Airways Corp. and Fidelity Investments. Costco and JetBlue accounted for 23% of AmEx's U.S. balances at the end of 2015.

While Hilton is a loss for Citigroup, it was the issuer that wrested Costco away from AmEx, a far bigger arrangement.

The loss of partnerships like Costco diminished investor confidence in AmEx's ability to grow and pushed the issuer to increase lending to help boost revenue. The setbacks also occurred as AmEx has come under increasing pressure in the high-end rewards-card space, notably from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and its Sapphire Reserve rewards card.

The last time AmEx won a new credit-card partnership in the U.S. was in 2015, when it announced an exclusive agreement with Charles Schwab Corp. Yet co-branded cards remain important for AmEx.

Such cards accounted for 34% of the company's world-wide loan balances and 15% of its billings during the last half of last year. Its largest co-brand portfolios are with Delta, which accounts for 20% of world-wide loan balances, and Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., which accounts for 5% of balances, according to AmEx data. All of its other co-brands comprise 9% of balances.

""Co-brands are very important for AmEx . . . and this particular arrangement is meaningful for us,"" said Denise Pickett, president of U.S. consumer services at AmEx.

Meanwhile, Jud Linville, chief executive at Citi Cards, played down the loss, saying in a statement that ""during negotiations, it became clear that terms of exclusivity given the relatively small size of the portfolio were not economically viable.""

While Hilton is now in AmEx's win column, investors are also awaiting news about the fate of its Starwood relationship. Marriott International Inc. completed its acquisition of Starwood last year, and the hotel is reviewing several scenarios, including whether to merge the Marriott and Starwood credit-card programs, or to leave them separate.

Marriott's credit cards are issued by J.P. Morgan Chase. A decision will likely be made about the Marriott and Starwood cards by the end of the year, according to a person familiar with the matter."
Ctit Group,"Markets &amp; Finance: Venezuela Turns to Small Lenders --- As big banks keep their distance, the country must rely on little-known firms"," Jun 2, 2017",0,"CARACAS -- Largely shunned by Wall Street, Venezuela is turning to small firms to arrange financing for its operations amid a collapsing economy and daily riots.

The sale of $2.8 billion of bonds last week to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., brokered by a London firm with less than $5 million in assets, is the latest example of financing led by a small company. Big banks are shying away from doing deals with the administration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro because they are wary of the risks involved, especially to their reputations.

A $5 billion bond issue in December was structured by a small Paris private-equity firm. A Miami dealer that was fined in 2016 by regulators was hired last year by Venezuela's state oil company to try to swap $2.5 billion of debt.

Some of the world's biggest banks have scaled back business with embattled Mr. Maduro. The U.S. has leveled sanctions against some of his government's highest officials, and his rule has grown more authoritarian amid a deepening humanitarian crisis.

""There's a reputational risk here for investment banks, so the government is having to turn to little-known intermediaries,"" said Asdrubal Oliveros, director at Caracas-based consultancy Ecoanalitica.

Governments rely on big-name banks to market their securities because they can tap deep pools of capital in different regions and currencies. Small financial firms often lack economies of scale, market recognition and dedicated compliance departments, resulting in higher fees for the government and less transparency for citizens, said Orlando Ochoa, economics professor at Caracas's Catholic University.

Citigroup Inc., the U.S.'s fourth-largest lender by assets, last year closed its dollar correspondence account with Venezuela's central bank, saying it did so for business reasons. Mr. Maduro had accused Citi and other big banks of waging a ""financial blockade.""

Germany's Deutsche Bank AG and Commerzbank AG closed their trading platforms for Venezuelan clients last year, former users said. Representatives for both banks declined to comment.

Earlier this year, one of Japan's biggest investment banks, Nomura Securities, passed on a deal that would have involved lending $1 billion to the central bank in exchange for $3 billion of the bonds, most of which eventually went to Goldman Sachs, according to people involved in the deal.

Bank of America Corp. considered marketing the bonds, but backed away as the situation on the ground worsened, say familiar with the matter.

The central bank then tapped Dinosaur Merchant Bank Ltd. The London-based broker sold the bonds to Goldman's asset-management arm, said people familiar with the matter. Dinosaur booked a profit of $400,000 in the U.K. in 2015, according to its latest annual report.

Goldman is facing a backlash for buying the bonds, a transaction that the Venezuelan opposition said was effectively a lifeline to the Maduro administration because the central bank had held them.

While Nomura backed away from the earlier deal, which would have left it exposed to the risk of a default for years, the bank did buy about $100 million in face-value bonds from Dinosaur in the same transaction last week that involved Goldman, people familiar with the matter have said. Nomura aims to resell the bonds, purchased through its trading arm, to clients, the people said.

Dinosaur Chief Executive Glenn Grossman declined to comment Monday, and a managing director for the firm didn't respond to further requests for comment.

For its latest debt sale, Venezuela's finance ministry hired Paris-based investment group Global Emerging Markets, or GEM, to structure the $5 billion bond that was privately placed in December, according to the firm. On its website, GEM says it focuses on small private-equity transactions worth less than $100 million.

""When things are difficult and people and businesses are pulling out of the country, that creates opportunity,"" GEM manager Warren P. Baker III told The Wall Street Journal in January, referring to the deal. He couldn't be reached for comment this week."
Ctit Group,"LSE, Citi in Deal for Indexes, Analytics Services"," May 31, 2017",1,"LONDON -- London Stock Exchange Group PLC agreed Tuesday to buy a portfolio of fixed-income indexes and related analytics services from Citigroup Inc. for $685 million, the U.K. exchange operator's latest bet on the growth of passive investing.

The LSE is under pressure to identify targets as part of its strategy to bolster earnings after European regulators in March blocked its proposed merger with Deutsche Boerse AG. The European Union was concerned that the proposed $30 billion pan-European exchange tie-up would gain too much influence over the clearing of fixed-income trading.

The Citigroup deal fits with LSE's focus on expanding its operations selling market data and licensing indexes for institutional investors and developers of exchange-traded funds as new competition and computerized trading pressure fees from the more traditional business of operating venues for buying and selling stocks.

For Citigroup, the global bank gains a buyer that is committed to expanding its Citi Fixed Income Indices and Yield Book operations, which it had decided weren't key to its own strategy.

""This transaction is a positive outcome for The Yield Book and Citi Fixed Income Indices for both clients and employees,"" said Okan Pekin, Citigroup's global head of investor services, in a news release.

The LSE's index business is among the exchange operator's fastest-growing operations as the increasing popularity of low-cost funds that mimic benchmarks drives demand for indexes. In the first quarter, LSE's index business reported an 11% jump in organic revenue from the year-earlier period. The acquisition of Citigroup's fixed-income indexes are meant to augment that growth by broadening the exchange's offering of benchmarks to reach a larger customer base.

Citigroup's fixed-income indexes business, which includes the World Government Bond Index, has about 300 clients, including 200 buy-side fixed-income asset managers. The indexes will become part of the LSE's FTSE Russell's existing portfolio of indexes.

Citigroup's yield-book products are used to collect and analyze historical pricing data that are used to build indexes. The tools are applied to an array of fixed-income instruments such as mortgages, government and corporate bonds, and derivatives securities. The business services about 350 financial institutions globally, ranging from hedge funds to central banks.

Last year, Citigroup's yield-book and fixed-income indexes businesses generated $107 million of revenue."
Ctit Group,OPEC Chief Relishes Role As Ambassador for Group," May 25, 2017",1,"VIENNA -- During a turbulent year for oil prices, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' top official, Mohammad Barkindo, has embraced a role as the global energy industry's chief diplomat.

Since taking over as secretary-general almost a year ago, the wisecracking 58-year-old Nigerian with a closet full of Nehru jackets has reached beyond OPEC in a way few of the cloistered group's officials have in the past.

Mr. Barkindo was a main architect of the agreement last year bringing together the fractious 13-member group and almost a dozen other big producers for the first coordinated crude-oil supply cuts in eight years.

He served as an important channel between OPEC-member rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran, shuttling between the two countries when they didn't have diplomatic relations last year and brokering an oil-policy detente that cleared the way for a deal.

Mr. Barkindo traveled to Houston to meet U.S. shale producers this year and hosted meetings with oil traders in London and New York.

He has made a point of inviting big non-OPEC producers such as Azerbaijan to Vienna for talks. His latest mission is to keep OPEC's fragile coalition alive at this week's meeting in Vienna of OPEC members and nonmembers that have joined cuts, such as Russia, Mexico and Kazakhstan.

The group is expected to renew its pledges to withhold almost 2% of global oil supply and continue with efforts to drain a vast surplus that has weighed down crude prices.

Helima Croft, chief commodities strategist at RBC Capital Markets and longtime observer of OPEC, said Mr. Barkindo is the modern oil industry's version of Klemens Metternich, the 19th-century Austrian empire diplomat who helped reorder Europe's political system during the rise and fall of Napoleon.

""He is a diplomat rather than an expert, and that helps to get everyone in the room to get on,"" said Bhushan Bahree, a senior director on oil at U.S. consulting firm IHS and a longtime OPEC watcher.

Since taking over as OPEC secretary-general last August, Mr. Barkindo has transformed a role once seen as little more than the group's top bureaucrat with no real role in decision making into an important ambassadorship, serving as an emissary both inside and outside the group.

Mr. Barkindo plays down any efforts to elevate the role and says he is simply following his own experience through five oil-cycle downturns to get OPEC through ""challenging times.""

Ed Morse, the Citigroup Inc. oil analyst who counts Mr. Barkindo as a friend, says the OPEC chief ""has a mission to make OPEC relevant and to make it more professional.""

But when OPEC didn't achieve Mr. Barkindo's goal of reducing vast oil supplies as quickly as some thought possible, prices slipped late last month and early this month. Mr. Barkindo was part of the decision to frame OPEC's production cuts as a way to bring oil storage -- a proxy for a global oversupply -- down to a five-year average.

""It set up unrealistic expectations,"" Mr. Morse said.

Mr. Barkindo's style contrasts with that of his predecessor, Abdalla Salem el-Badri, who Ms. Croft said was seen as a technocrat who rarely engaged at the highest political levels.

Mr. Badri didn't respond to a request to comment.

The oil industry breeds diplomats, with its international nature and resources located in often troubled countries with autocratic regimes. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson got firsthand experience engaging world leaders over a decade as Exxon Mobil Corp.'s chief executive. Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, remains an important global oil emissary as well.

Mr. Barkindo has elevated the secretary-general role into that sphere of influence."

Ctit Group,Finance &amp; Markets: Blockchain Firm R3 Raises $107 Million," May 24, 2017",1,"R3 CEV, one of many firms trying to capitalize on the technology behind the digital currency bitcoin, said Tuesday that it had raised $107 million from a group of 40 global banks, including Citigroup Inc. of the U.S., France's Societe Generale SA, and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group of Japan.

The fundraising is one of the largest rounds for a firm developing so-called blockchain technology and trails only the $116 million raised by 21 Inc. in 2015. It occurred amid a burst of new interest this spring in bitcoin, alternative cryptocurrencies and the technology behind them. The price of bitcoin has more than doubled so far this year to about $2,280.

Blockchain is the distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin. Financial firms, and banks in particular, view it as having the potential to allow for secure, cheap and instantaneous transactions anywhere in the world.

New York-based R3 is looking to complete another round of fundraising later this year. It launched a partnership with nine banks in September 2015; the group now totals 80 banks.

Last August, R3 unveiled its technology platform, dubbed Corda. In some respects, it resembles bitcoin by enabling peer-to-peer transactions. But the platform is specialized for banking services, with an eye toward streamlining back-office operations."

Ctit Group,"Banking &amp; Finance: Citigroup, Nasdaq Team Up"," May 23, 2017",1,"Citigroup Inc. and Nasdaq Inc. are forging a partnership to match up the blockchain with real money.

The two companies said they have been working together, along with technology startup Chain Inc., for months to link Citigroup's business-payments services to Nasdaq's blockchain platform that has been used for activities such as buying and selling shares of private companies.

For blockchain, the move represents a notable chapter in its development. Blockchain is the peer-to-peer technology first developed to transfer ownership of the virtual currency bitcoin between people.

Bitcoin's value has soared this year, crossing over $2,000 in recent days. But it still hasn't found widespread traction in traditional banking. The recent WannaCry computer attack asked for ransom payments in bitcoin.

With the partnership, details of which were expected to be announced Monday, a blockchain is connecting to one of the largest and most established bank money-transfer systems. And it gives big banks a way to earn fees helping new networks facilitate business payments if traditional settlement or invoice systems are disrupted.

Overall, banks, exchanges, and other financial firms have poured more than $1 billion into projects and startups using forms of the underlying blockchain technology, according to Greenwich Associates.

The aim, still in the early stages, is to be able to move things such as stocks, derivatives and other assets between two parties much more cheaply than with existing systems.

But without bitcoin or another digital currency, however, those systems might be missing a crucial ingredient: money. Efforts to create digital versions of dollars and other government-backed currencies are in their infancy.

Starting last year, Citigroup and Nasdaq began working together to match up Nasdaq's Linq blockchain platform to Citigroup's Treasury and Trade Solutions unit, which moves trillions of dollars globally in business payments. Both firms are investors in San Francisco-based Chain, and have worked with the startup in their blockchain efforts. Citigroup invested in Chain through its venture arm, Citi Ventures, which worked with its treasury unit on the project.

The new system links CitiConnect, a tool that can be used to manage large-sum payments across borders and across currencies, to blockchains -- in this case Nasdaq's Linq. This speeds up a key part of the usual multiday settlement process for trades.

The companies have already used the new system to make payments on trades, they said. Citigroup would earn standard fees to facilitate the payments just as it would for any business-to-business transfer.

The new system is a pilot for Citigroup, which for now is working with Nasdaq and Chain, but could develop it for other clients as well, the bank said.

The new system ""will lead to relatively greater maturity of blockchain technology, and integrate it into our existing financial infrastructure,"" said Naveed Sultan, Citigroup's global head of Treasury and Trade Solutions. ""That may lead to greater adoption of venues powered by blockchain."""
Ctit Group,Streetwise: Time to Bring Back Pre-Trump Playbook," May 23, 2017",1,"A week is a long time in politics, and last week the reality-TV show that is Donald Trump's administration packed in enough extra episodes to fill a box set. But investors have hit mute.

Stocks remain strong, although not because of bets on tax cuts, easier regulation or an infrastructure boom.

In fact, quite the opposite. Stocks that should benefit from lower corporate taxes, cuts to red tape or infrastructure building have seen bets against them leap this year. J.P. Morgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou calculates that relative to marketwide short positions -- bets on a falling price -- there is now more shorting of stocks that should be tax-cut winners than before the election.

Stocks in S&P 500 high-tax companies that ought to be the biggest winners from lower taxes have this year given back all of their early postelection outperformance and more, according to Goldman Sachs calculations. Similarly, smaller companies have underperformed bigger rivals, which tend to be better able to manipulate loopholes in the tax code.

Investors don't think Mr. Trump will be impeached. But he was already finding it difficult to get his policies through Congress, and last week's White House shenanigans will make it harder still.

Even before the latest episodes of ""All the President's Tweets,"" speculators had been paring bets on the dollar, and it has now completed a full reversal of its postelection gains against developed currencies. Mr. Panigirtzoglou estimates dollar bets overall are now flat, with speculators positioned for the euro to gain.

So what should worry investors? The biggest support for markets as the Trump trade evaporated was the widespread belief in synchronized global growth. Europe, the U.K. and Japan have surprised economists with the strength of their recoveries this year. In the eurozone, there is even optimism about earnings again. Analyst upgrades outnumber downgrades by the most since the Greek bailout in 2010.

Yet, that synchronized growth seems to be leaving the U.S. behind. Estimates of U.S. output this year have been cut back, even as economists surveyed by Consensus Economics raised forecasts for Europe, the U.K. and Japan. U.S. economic data have been coming in below expectations this month, too, with Citigroup's economic-surprise and inflation-surprise indexes turning negative for the U.S.

The bond markets have already accepted weaker growth, with the 10-year Treasury yielding 2.25%, down from December's peak above 2.6%. The gap between the two- and 10-year yields, which typically widens when growth and inflation are expected, is again narrower than on Election Day.

S&P 500 companies make about a third of sales overseas, so they should show less concern than Treasurys about economic expansion. But even for equities the postelection euphoria about U.S. growth has gone, and with it the bets on growth-sensitive cyclical stocks and smaller companies. The extreme example is U.S. Steel Corp., which should win big from protectionism, lower tax rates, infrastructure spending and domestic growth. Its shares doubled from Election Day to late February, and have now fallen all the way back down.

Instead, U.S. markets have been led since the end of February by the big technology companies that can thrive even in a weak economy, and by the bond proxies of defensive utility stocks. (A rise in a third sector, consumer discretionary, is usually a sign that the economy is doing well, but this time it was because of the soaring price of Amazon.com Inc., by far its biggest component.)

Investors who still think Mr. Trump will be able to work with Congress to cut corporate taxes and boost the economy should be buying smaller stocks, infrastructure plays and nontech cyclicals.

The alternative for those who want to keep money in the U.S. market is to pick from the pre-Trump playbook of paying up for earnings growth in the tech sector or paying up for safe yield from the bond proxies. Faced with these expensive choices, a lot of money is being sent abroad, making it even more important that the European and Japanese economies don't, as so often, disappoint investors."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp; Finance: Breakup of Big Banks Not in Cards," May 19, 2017",1,"WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration took the idea of breaking up big banks off the table Thursday, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin telling a congressional panel that isn't what officials have in mind in reviewing the line between commercial- and investment-banking activities.

""We do not support a separation of banks from investment banks,"" Mr. Mnuchin said before the Senate Banking Committee. He said doing so would create problems for the ""financial markets, on the economy, and liquidity.""

The statement was a strong indication the Trump administration's review of U.S. banking regulations will be less onerous than Wall Street's worst fears. Officials say their priority is overhauling regulations with the aim of boosting lending and economic growth.

President Donald Trump's economic team has said it is considering a modern version of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act -- a partially repealed law that would force the largest U.S. banks to break themselves apart if it were still in effect. The issue has created confusion and angst among bankers and analysts every time an official mentions the topic.

One reason for the tension: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), a member of the banking committee, has introduced a bill she also calls the ""21st Century Glass-Steagall Act.""

Her bill, which has yet to receive support from any other committee members, mandates that a financial company can't own a traditional bank -- one that takes deposits, makes loans and processes payments -- alongside other business, such as underwriting and marketing stocks and bonds. The 1933 version of Glass-Steagall included similar prohibitions before it was partly repealed in 1999.

Those who support a revival of Glass-Steagall argue, among other things, that combining securities and banking activities allows financial firms to become too large and politically powerful, which in turn allows them to take excessive risks, exploit clients and rely on taxpayer bailouts if they get in trouble.

Behemoths such as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., and Bank of America Corp. would have to split apart under Ms. Warren's proposal. For other Wall Street titans, the impact might be less severe. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said on May 9 that although he doesn't believe reinstating Glass-Steagall makes sense today, ""our adaptation to that would be relatively easy,"" because the firm's bank is ""very minor"" compared with its other businesses.

Ms. Warren on Thursday said it was ""just bizarre"" that the Trump administration could claim to support Glass-Steagall without supporting bank breakups.

More details about how the Trump administration wants to tailor rules should come in June, when the Treasury Department is scheduled to report to Mr. Trump about a broad review of financial regulations.

National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn in April said, ""If we come up with a 21st-century, modern Glass-Steagall, we may be able to tailor regulation for different aspects of the financial markets and different aspects of financial institutions.""

Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika -- the only bank regulator the Trump administration has installed so far -- is skeptical of returning to Glass-Steagall. In an interview last week, he said banks are safer if they rely on several different businesses for revenue.

Mr. Noreika also said Glass-Steagall would have limited the government's options during the 2008 financial crisis. J.P. Morgan couldn't have purchased the teetering Bear Stearns investment bank, Bank of America couldn't have bought struggling Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley couldn't have converted to bank holding companies to stabilize themselves.

""It may sound like great politics to say we are going to bring back all the sections of Glass-Steagall,"" Mr. Noreika said, ""but do you want another Bear Stearns?""

Analysts say the administration could use existing regulatory authority to restrict interactions at subsidiaries of large financial firms, while cutting back regulations that apply to each type of business.

""Mr. Trump can have his Glass-Steagall cake and still eat regulatory relief because the rules for banks could get a lot less binding even as [bank holding companies] are severed into component parts,"" Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics Inc., said in an April note to clients.

A key question, according Ms. Petrou, is how the separate businesses will be regulated.

Under one proposal from Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Vice Chairman Thomas Hoenig, big firms' banking and securities businesses would have to fund themselves mostly separately and with a higher share of investor equity than they do today.

Ctit Group,Business News: Australia Beckons Amazon," May 18, 2017",1,"Amazon.com Inc. is preparing to bring its full retail offering to Australia, signaling a major competitive threat to the country's retailers and an important new beachhead for its global distribution network.

Australia's more favorable regulatory climate is also likely to offer Amazon opportunities to test deliveries via autonomous drones and road vehicles, a person familiar with the matter said. Australia last year rolled out new rules for remote-operated drones, and government officials are looking to develop national guidelines for autonomous-vehicle trials.

Amazon, which announced its Australia intentions last month, hasn't said when the full retail offering will roll out. Some analysts say 2018 is a likely date.

Australians can already order products from Amazon overseas, but they typically pay higher prices for shipping and wait longer for delivery than Amazon shoppers in other countries with domestic operations. This has constrained Amazon's challenge to online competitors such as eBay Inc. in Australia, as well as traditional retailers, which have until now been somewhat insulated from the demise of brick-and-mortar stores rippling across the U.S.

That could soon change. One analysis from Citigroup Inc. found that Amazon sales could grow from between 500 million Australian dollars (US$371.3 million) and A$700 million currently to A$4 billion in the medium term, a significant chunk of the roughly A$20 billion Australian e-commerce market. Electronics retailers are expected to be the hardest hit, with Citi lowering its long-term earnings-per-share forecasts for some Australian companies by more than 30%.

Australian retailers until now haven't faced the kind of competition that would have forced them to invest heavily in their online offerings, said Citi retail analyst Bryan Raymond. Retailers in other countries have ""been forced into it through Amazon or someone else pushing people that way,"" he said.

The Australian e-commerce market is small compared with the U.S., where online sales last year were estimated at $391 billion, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, but the lack of a truly dominant online retailer suggests there is an opportunity for Amazon. One measure from Citi gives Amazon 4% market share in Australia. In the U.S., Amazon's share is 31%, Citi says.

Australian e-commerce sales lag behind other developed countries, so there could be room for growth, making Australia an attractive market for Amazon as it seeks to expand its international footprint. The company is spending billions of dollars to secure growth in Mexico and India, and recently reupped its attempt to take on Alibaba Group Holding in China as it diversifies away from relatively saturated U.S. and European markets.

The Chinese market has proved tough to conquer. Amazon launched its Prime membership program there late last year, aiming to capitalize on Chinese consumers' desire for products from overseas, but it has been fighting to gain share against entrenched local incumbents. India has been more of a success story, where Amazon is one of two market leaders. Still, it is facing increased competition there, too, after No. 1 Flipkart Group's recent $1.4 billion fundraising round.

Amazon has cited its rapid international growth as a reason for higher spending in recent quarters. The company takes varying approaches by market when it expands internationally and balances growth carefully with management bandwidth, said Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky on a recent earnings call.

""We pick our spots carefully,"" he added.

In Australia, online sales were about 7% of total retail in 2016, compared with 11% in the U.S., 15% in the U.K., and 18% in South Korea, according to Euromonitor International."
Ctit Group,OPEC Tries To Beat 'Shorts'," May 18, 2017",0,"OPEC is trying harder than ever to win over big investors, but the group is finding that falling oil prices are making that a tough sell.

Dozens of hedge-fund managers and oil traders attended a series of closed-door meetings in recent months with OPEC leaders -- the first of their kind, according to Ed Morse, Citigroup Inc.'s global head of commodities research, who helped organize some of the events.

Group officials made the case for how supply cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would reduce the global glut. Instead, stockpiles have remained stubbornly high, oil prices are down close to 10% from their February peak, and some prominent hedge-fund traders are reeling.

Pierre Andurand, a French hedge-fund manager with a history of double-digit-percentage returns, met with a Saudi official from OPEC just before the Nov. 30 decision to cut production, said people familiar with the meeting. On the heels of a series of bullish bets, his main fund at Andurand Capital is down about 16% this year through May 5, according to a person who had seen the performance numbers.

The oil group is now intentionally countering ""shorts,"" funds that bet on falling oil prices, an OPEC official said. The official pointed to an announcement earlier this week that Russian and Saudi Arabian energy ministers would support another nine months of production cuts. It was a response to the recent fall in prices and designed to show how serious big producers are about cutting output.

""We are hitting back at the shorts,"" the official said. Oil rose 2.1% on Monday after the announcement.

Prices gave up some of those gains on Tuesday but edged higher again Wednesday, rising 0.84% to $49.07 a barrel after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that stockpiles continued to fall last week. But many traders see any extension as OPEC's acknowledgment that the first round of cuts wasn't effective and further evidence that the group's influence on the market has become severely limited.

""In my view, it's the wrong response,"" Doug King, chief investment officer at RCMA Asset Management and manager of that firm's $200 million Merchant Commodity hedge fund, said of extending the current cuts. ""We're not seeing what we needed to see,"" he said. ""They need to cut harder, right now.""

Mr. Morse of Citigroup said he arranged introductions between OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo and the more than 100 hedge-fund managers and other oil buyers who have met with Mr. Barkindo in Washington, D.C., New York and London since October.

The coordinated outreach was a new effort by the group to build bridges between its members and Wall Street, aiming to persuade investors that producers were serious about reining in supply, Mr. Barkindo said.

After asking what OPEC planned to do to boost prices, fund managers came away impressed, Mr. Morse said, adding that some still text with the OPEC leader.

OPEC's cuts started in January. Oil prices jumped 8.7% in December as traders anticipated an easing supply glut. Bullish bets by money managers hit a record for the 10 years of data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission early this year.

Many analysts aligned with the upbeat mood, forecasting that crude prices would reach $60 a barrel or higher by the end of 2017.

U.S. oil inventories have declined since OPEC's output cuts, but they remain near historic highs. That is in part because U.S. production has increased by about 200,000 barrels a day during the past two months.

If output continues to rise at that pace, U.S. producers could replace much of what OPEC has taken off the market, analysts say.

In recent weeks, hedge funds have cut their bullish position on oil prices to the lowest level since November as a gasoline glut raised worries that demand could falter.

Mr. Andurand told investors in an April 24 letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal that oil prices ""will reach new highs."" But three weeks later, he had abandoned most of his bullish bets, said a person familiar with the matter.

Veteran oil trader Andrew Hall also bet heavily that OPEC's strategy would work. A fund managed by his Astenbeck Capital Management LLC, a Southport, Conn., hedge-fund firm, lost 17% this year through April, said a person familiar with the matter.

Mr. Hall is one of a few still preaching patience. He recently wrote to investors predicting that inventory excesses would be eliminated, said the person familiar with the matter. Astenbeck and Mr. Hall didn't respond to a request for comment. It isn't clear if he or anyone at his fund attended meetings with OPEC."
Ctit Group,Global Finance: Citi Picks Leaders For New Group," May 13, 2017",1,"Citigroup Inc. has named veterans Mickey Bhatia and Carey Lathrop as co-heads of a new group spanning credit trading and securitization, key cogs in its growing fixed-income business.

The moves were announced by the bank in an internal memo Friday from Paco Ybarra, Citigroup's global head of markets and securities services, according to a copy reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Mr. Bhatia, who is currently head of global structured credit products, will, in part, take the role of Mark Tsesarsky, who earlier this month left Citigroup after three decades to join hedge fund Millennium Management LLC.

Alongside Mr. Bhatia will be Mr. Lathrop, currently Citigroup's global head of credit markets. Mr. Lathrop will still focus on credit markets, but will now also lead securitized markets.

The two will work together to further integrate the trading of bonds and other more-complex credit products.

The idea is to balance out swings in trading activity between the two areas. Bond activity tends to wind down during periods of low volatility, as is the case in today's markets. The opposite is true of structured credit products.

Though esoteric, securitized products are a big business for Citigroup. This involves the structuring and trading of bonds backed by corporate loans, consumer loans, mortgages, credit derivatives, and other more exotic assets.

Overall, Citigroup has the second-biggest fixed-income trading unit on Wall Street, after J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., generating $3.6 billion in revenue in the first quarter.

The bank credited an uptick in the trading of its securitized-products as a factor in its 19% first-quarter revenue jump from a year ago.

Mr. Bhatia, who holds a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, joined Citigroup 10 years ago from Deutsche Bank AG.

Mr. Lathrop, a veteran bond trader who started at Salomon Brothers in 1988, has been Citigroup's head of global credit markets since August 2008."
Ctit Group,Officials Expanded Bank Loans in April --- Medium- and long-term lending to corporations was the highest for the month in 10 years," May 13, 2017",1,"BEIJING -- Strong demand from households and businesses drove up bank lending last month, though nontraditional credit slowed as the authorities moved to restrict shadow banking.

Chinese financial institutions issued 1.1 trillion yuan ($159.3 billion) of new loans in April, up from March's 1.02 trillion yuan, data from the People's Bank of China showed Friday. That surpassed the 766.5 billion yuan median forecast by economists in a Wall Street Journal poll.

Medium- and long-term corporate loans, an indicator of loan demand, stood at 522.6 billion yuan in April, the highest for the month in the past 10 years, said economists at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. They said April's surprise credit expansion could also have been because of front-load funding demand ahead of further expected regulatory tightening.

Total social financing, a broader measurement of credit that includes nonbank lending as well as bank loans, was 1.39 trillion yuan in April, down from 2.12 trillion yuan in March.

Shadow banking's portion dropped to 12.7% of the newly increased social financing from 35.6% in March, Citigroup economists said. China's regulatory tightening has also affected banks' off-balance sheet credit, they said. Nontraditional lenders, such as trust companies and other nonbank companies, are known as shadow bankers."
Ctit Group,Microsoft's Focus on Cloud Area Should Keep Paying Off," May 8, 2017",1,"Microsoft may be designing its own personal computers these days, but it has successfully convinced investors that it is past its dependence on them. Now comes the hard part.

Over the past three years, Microsoft appears to have settled the existential crisis of being the company that ushered in the PC era but missed the mobile one. Microsoft's focus on building a large cloud platform to offer its software and services across any device or operating system has resonated with investors. Its stock is up nearly 90% since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in early 2014 to lead that push. The Nasdaq Composite is up about 51% in that time.

The addition of about $230 billion in market cap -- more than the total market value of about 97% of the companies in the S&P 500 -- means Microsoft's cloud now needs to deliver a big silver lining. Mr. Nadella is likely to focus heavily on the cloud come Wednesday, when he kicks off the company's annual Build conference that once served mainly as the showcase for the Windows operating system.

Two of Microsoft's three operating segments contain cloud-related businesses. The good news is those two segments are on track to comprise about 64% of total revenue for the fiscal year ending in June, compared with 54% two years prior. The bad news is Microsoft doesn't disclose enough information to tell just how well its cloud business is performing. Improving that would bolster the company's case for growth.

That is important because the cloud business is expensive to build and to operate and doesn't command the same profitability as Microsoft's past big businesses, such as Windows and Office. Adjusted operating margins have compressed to the low 30% range in the past three years, compared with an average of 37% for the five years prior. And Microsoft's growing efforts at hardware -- like the new Surface laptop introduced last week and a new supercharged Xbox coming this fall -- also weigh on its margins.

Microsoft has signaled that its margins are on pace to improve, and its capital spending is expected to moderate over the next year. It also needs to add more clarity to its cloud business. Walter Pritchard of Citigroup estimates Azure, the Microsoft cloud business that competes with Amazon's AWS, will hit about $3.5 billion in revenue for the fiscal year ending in June, compared with $1.8 billion the previous year.

That's still a lot smaller than AWS, which is projected to top $14 billion in revenue for the same period. But Azure's rapid growth rate is helping to close some of that gap. At 22 times forward earnings, Microsoft is fetching its highest multiple in more than a decade. But it is cheaper than Google parent Alphabet and Amazon, making it a reasonable bet for a rising cloud."
Ctit Group,"Hedge-Fund Ace Gets Burned in Silicon Valley --- After years of success, Wellington's Nick Adams dove into startups; apology and refunds"," May 5, 2017",1,"For a solid decade, Nick Adams averaged 28% annual returns on the money he managed for a secretive trillion-dollar investment firm.

Then he fell in love with Silicon Valley venture deals. That's when things took a very different turn.

Today, the Wellington Management Co. star has been reduced to steps unthinkable for most hedge-fund managers. He is admitting mistakes and apologizing. He has even agreed to refund fees, according to investors.

The travails of Mr. Adams, a 56-year-old descendant of the second U.S. president, has riveted Wall Street and startup circles. Wellington, with $1 trillion under management, is one of many old-guard investors, including giants such as Fidelity Investments and Tiger Global Management, that piled into startup technology companies in recent years trying to strike gold with the next Facebook Inc. The new money helped push investments in venture-backed companies to $77 billion in 2015.

The frenzy has since faded, turning Mr. Adams's misadventures into a cautionary tale about chasing Silicon Valley riches. Venture-capital investment plummeted 42% last year, putting pressure on existing investments by making it harder to attract new money at higher valuations. Fewer companies are filing for initial public offerings, a step that would allow them to repay their early backers. Fidelity has slashed its estimates of the value of some of its startup stakes, and Tiger Global reported double-digit investment losses last year.

Mr. Adams, who made his name investing in bank stocks, has lost money in two of the past three years. His funds poured hundreds of millions of dollars into two tech startups, Mozido Inc. and Powa Technologies Group PLC, and told investors they were growing ever more valuable, boosting his fees. Now both companies are financially distressed.

Wellington has been urging investors to stick around, according to people who have heard from the firm. Mr. Adams has made dozens of calls to clients. Wellington has told investors in writing that Mr. Adams had ""forsworn"" ever again investing in such private deals in his flagship fund.

Several large investors pulled their money, including the Blackstone Group LP, one of the world's largest hedge-fund investors. By the beginning of this year, Mr. Adams's portfolio at Wellington had shrunk to about $6 billion, down roughly 40% from its peak in 2014, reflecting both investor withdrawals and investment declines, according to people familiar with the firm's finances.

Wellington was formed one year before the 1929 stock-market crash. It was the first-ever so-called balanced mutual fund -- a diverse collection of stocks and bonds designed to produce steadier returns than investments in single companies. Wellington's founder hired Jack Bogle, who as chairman orchestrated mergers with other fund companies that in the 1960s left it with big holdings of several stocks that imploded in the 1973 stock-market crash. Mr. Bogle was fired. He later started indexing pioneer Vanguard Group, now Wellington's biggest investment client.

As a youngster, Mr. Adams sold used hubcaps he collected along the highway. His great-grandfather founded the Boston Bruins hockey team. After Mr. Adams graduated from Princeton University, he joined Wellington and quickly earned a reputation as a talented trader of bank stocks. When a rival offered to stake him to start his own shop in 1994, Wellington matched the offer by helping him raise millions of dollars from its own clients.

Mr. Adams used the money to start Wellington's first hedge fund, Bay Pond. Peers such as longtime bank investor Anton Schutz began following his moves. ""When I look at a company, I look at who owns it, and there are a couple of guys, when I don't see their names on the list, I ask, why not?"" Mr. Schutz explains. Learning Mr. Adams likes a company, he says, ""tells you it's OK.""

Inside Wellington, Mr. Adams also attracted attention for what some colleagues regard as eccentricities. He owns a miniature potbellied pig, named Mona Lisa, that he walks outdoors on a leash and takes with him on private jet flights. He persuaded Boston's Ritz-Carlton, where he keeps an apartment, to waive its policy against pigs by describing Mona Lisa as a therapy animal, people familiar with the matter say. He attracted attention from the local tabloid press by divorcing his wife and marrying his first cousin.

In the office, he developed a reputation as someone who steeped himself in financial details of investment companies and could easily get major bank chiefs on the phone. Investors say that in meetings, Mr. Adams often answers questions in a roundabout manner. ""You might ask an innocent question about the valuations of big banks and 20 minutes later you'll end up with a political statement about how terrible the Fed is,"" said one investor who recently cashed out.

At his peak, Mr. Adams helped manage roughly $10 billion for Wellington and its clients. He bought a Palm Beach, Fla., Spanish revivalist villa and a mansion in the Philadelphia suburbs formerly owned by film director M. Night Shyamalan featuring a $100,000 children's tree house with a drawbridge and trap door.

For one especially profitable year, 2007, Mr. Adams took home more than $26 million, according to records made public in his divorce.

The 2008 financial crisis marked a turning point. Rules subsequently imposed under the Dodd-Frank legislation limited some of the most lucrative activities of traditional banks, including operating proprietary-trading arms. Mr. Adams expressed worry about mounting lawsuits and government fines against big banks for their role in the housing bust.

He told clients he was shifting to areas such as online alternative lending, which provides money to consumers and small businesses generally ignored by traditional banks. He also expressed enthusiasm for mobile banking and payments. He told investors that he expected the sector to be one of the most profitable bets of his career.

Because those areas were so new, there was a dearth of public companies in which to invest. The solution, he believed, was startups.

He relied on a decades-old network of bank executives at firms including Barclays PLC and Jefferies LLC to introduce him to financial-technology upstarts both well-known and obscure. He asked some company founders to make the pilgrimage to Radnor, Pa., where he and his team work at a corporate campus hundreds of miles from Wellington's Boston headquarters. He touted his freedom to make investments quickly.

Banker James ""Chip"" Mahan, who founded companies that counted Wellington as an investor, introduced Mr. Adams to nCino Inc., a tiny financial-software maker that designs lending systems for banks, according to founder Pierre Naude.

Mr. Naude wanted to sell common stock -- a risky investment proposition when sold by an unproven company -- but traditional venture capitalists weren't interested, he recalls. Most investors, as a precaution, wanted an arrangement that gave them more rights in the company. Mr. Adams took the deal, paying $10 million for common stock in early 2014.

""I was too happy to get money from a brand name like Wellington,"" Mr. Naude says. The company has subsequently raised money from other investors and signed up major banks as clients.

Fledgling companies and hotter startups such as home-rental website Airbnb Inc. and ride-sharing service Uber Technologies Inc. redefined Mr. Adams's portfolio.

Four years ago, the largest positions in Mr. Adams's main fund weren't financial-technology companies, an investor document shows. Soon thereafter, Mr. Adams invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Mozido and Powa.

Mozido, based in Austin, Texas, makes software that allows consumers, particularly those without bank accounts, to send and receive money with cellular telephones. The company had flipped its business model several times, from developing retailer-loyalty programs in the U.S. to helping retailers sell in China. Wellington was part of a group that invested $185 million in 2014, a deal that valued the company at $2.4 billion, Mozido said at the time.

Powa operated a smartphone app that allowed shoppers to make instant purchases by scanning bar codes on advertisements. The company's founder previously had run an internet venture that sold after its shares dropped sharply. Wellington invested $197 million in Powa through 2015.

Unlike many venture capitalists investing in startups, Mr. Adams didn't ask for a seat on either company's board, and he promised not to meddle in their day-to-day operations, people familiar with the matter say. He never visited Powa's London headquarters, according to two of those people.

Some of Mr. Adams's investors say they told him they were concerned he was straying from his strong suit -- bank stocks. He responded that the banking industry was in a long-term stasis and that any growth in the sector would have to come from new entrants. He showed his confidence by shifting one of his smaller funds, which earlier had bet on a rebound for beaten-down traditional banks, to focus on financial technology.

His big picks, however, were struggling. Mozido's financial results, which aren't publicly disclosed but were reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, show that the year Wellington invested, the company posted a loss of $34 million on revenue that was only 2% of what had been forecast.

Mozido's African arm, also financed by Wellington, went out of business. Mozido went several months without paying employees. It was sued last fall for unpaid bills and is currently involved in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, according to court filings and the company's lawyers. The SEC didn't respond a request for comment.

Powa, meanwhile, had burned through much of its cash. It rented prime office space in New York and London and hosted raucous company parties, including one that featured strippers in neon paint.

Regulators allow investment managers to largely set their own valuations for hard-to-trade assets such as stakes in startups. Wellington periodically increased its valuations for Mozido, Powa and other such investments in his portfolio. Mr. Adams's funds, like many hedge funds, collect 20% of annual investment gains as a year-end performance fee.

In December 2015, Wellington boosted its estimate of what Powa was worth, investor documents indicate. Mr. Adams didn't tell investors that one month earlier Wellington had hired consulting firm Deloitte LLP to advise on whether the company was insolvent, according to documents in U.K. insolvency proceedings.

In a written statement, Wellington said it hired Deloitte to advise it on its ""options under U.K. insolvency laws at a time when Powa was struggling financially."" Several weeks later, it said, Powa announced it had signed a joint venture to roll out its technology in China. Wellington said it believed that ""would materially aid Powa's business and its ability to raise additional money.""

Powa subsequently entered the U.K. equivalent of bankruptcy proceedings.

Mr. Adams has since apologized to investors. In an investor letter last year, he said Powa was ""one of the most disappointing investments in my more than 30+ years of investing.""

Wellington agreed to reverse its boosted valuation for Powa, and to refund fees that it had collected on Mr. Adams's overall portfolio as a result, according to documents reviewed by the Journal.

Mr. Adams's flagship fund, Bay Pond, was down 7% last year. Two smaller funds concentrated in startup stakes were down by double-digit percentages.

Airbnb, Uber and other startup bets have been moved to a so-called side pocket that cannot be immediately cashed out, an acknowledgment that they might not be easy to sell, at least not at a price attractive to Wellington.

Now, Mr. Adams is going back to what worked before -- big stakes in traditional lenders, including Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. The early results are encouraging. His main fund was up more than 12% in the first quarter of 2017.

""He's had some tough years,"" said Mr. Schutz, the bank investor and longtime friend. ""He always figures out a way to make money and come back."""
Ctit Group,Business News: ITV Chief to Depart After a Strong Run," May 4, 2017",1,"LONDON -- ITV PLC said Adam Crozier would step down as chief executive on June 30, after seven years overseeing major growth at the ""Downton Abbey"" broadcaster.

With the amicable parting, Britain's largest commercial TV network loses a leader who has shown it is possible for traditional broadcasters to combat the viewership shift to online competitors such as Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.

ITV, with its production companies, remains a potential target for telecommunications giants such as John Malone's Liberty Global PLC, ITV's biggest shareholder and the world's largest international cable operator by subscribers.

ITV was navigating an advertising-market slump when Mr. Crozier took over in 2010. That year the company reported GBP 2.1 billion ($2.7 billion) in revenue and GBP 408 million in earnings before interest, taxes and amortization. The ad market improved during Mr. Crozier's tenure, boosting revenue to GBP 3.1 billion and Ebita to GBP 885 million in 2016.

Citigroup analysts said Wednesday that Mr. Crozier's team implemented a clear strategy, reducing reliance on ad revenue while boosting the size and quality of its content-production business, which has made shows including soap opera ""Coronation Street.""

The telecommunications and media industries have been exploring mergers as wireless carriers and cable operators covet content they can offer subscribers. U.S. regulators are reviewing AT&T Inc.'s blockbuster $85 billion bid to buy Time Warner Inc.

A spokesman for Liberty Global, which owns 9.9% of ITV, declined to comment on its plans for its stake.

ITV said it has a succession plan and that finance chief Ian Griffiths will lead the company in the interim. Mr. Crozier, 53 years old and the former head of England's soccer governing body, said he would explore a role in the private sector."

Ctit Group,Investors Tune Into French Debate --- Money managers say TV battle Wednesday could prove pitfall for front-runner Macron," May 3, 2017",1,"Is the rise of populism in Europe fading or is there space for a comeback? Many investors expect the French presidential debate Wednesday to provide some answers.

Far-right candidate Marine Le Pen's few remaining chances to clinch a last-minute victory in the second round of the French presidential election Sunday, investors say, will depend on her television performance. While research suggests the impact of debates is often limited, money managers see it as a potential pitfall for pro-business candidate Emmanuel Macron, who is leading comfortably in the polls but remains politically inexperienced.

""That debate will be key,"" said Holly MacDonald, chief investment strategist at Bessemer Trust, a New York-based wealth manager with more than $100 billion under its wing. Mr. ""Macron is somewhat of an untested candidate.""

Mr. Macron managed to hold his own against Ms. Le Pen during the first televised debate in March but shared the airtime with four other candidates. Conservative Francois Fillon and socialist Benoit Hamon now back Mr. Macron in a bid to defeat the far-right candidate. This, analysts say, dents his antiestablishment credentials.

In a note to clients last week, Citigroup Inc. warned that the debate could swing votes toward Ms. Le Pen, who is ""likely to focus her attacks on Macron's investment-banking past, his establishment status, relative lack of experience, acceptance of immigration, globalization and the diktat of the European Union.""

The importance of the debate in investors' minds can be gauged by the implied volatility of options offering insurance against future swings in the euro versus the dollar. Two weeks ago, as one-week contracts started maturing after the first round of the election, their implied volatility shot up to 0.17 percentage point from 0.07. But yet another rise happened when the options started maturing after the debate, going up to 0.2 percentage point.

The cost of insurance plummeted across the board after Mr. Macron finished ahead in the first round on April 23 with 24% of the vote, against Ms. Le Pen's 21%. The CAC-40 stock index is up 4.8% since, and the extra compensation investors demand to hold French 10-year sovereign debt over German paper has fallen to around 0.5 percentage point from more than 0.7.

Yet, the spread remains double what it was before French election jitters started settling in and has slightly edged up again over the past week.

""I expect more volatility,"" said Nicolas Forest, global head of fixed-income management at Candriam Investors Group, who highlighted the debate as ""the big important event for markets.""

The widespread belief remains that Mr. Macron will have an easy win: The latest polls show he is set to win around 60% of the vote, a distance seen by analysts as insurmountable.

Whether televised debates can deliver election swings has been thoroughly researched in the U.S. but remains unclear.

According to University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee professor of political science Thomas Holbrook, even though there is ""pretty thin evidence"" that debates steer election outcomes, they can sometimes ""change the narrative"" of a campaign.

In last year's U.S. presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton appeared to get a boost in the polls after each of the three debates she had against Donald Trump, but she lost the election. Research for the 2012 campaign that pitted Barack Obama against Mitt Romney found that much of these moves aren't due to people changing their minds on who to vote for, but rather because the winner's supporters become more eager to answer pollsters.

""When you have three or four debates, typically the net effect tends to wash out,"" said Robert S. Erikson, professor of political science at Columbia University, but short-term effects can be more powerful, which in this case might work in Ms. Le Pen's favor.

""What could be interesting is how many people will watch the debate,"" said Didier Saint-Georges, managing director and member of the investment committee at Carmignac, a French asset manager with 56 billion euros ($61 billion) under its wing. ""If viewing is very low, it could be perceived as a preview of a low turnout on election day,"" which could conceivably give Ms. Le Pen a fighting chance.

Even if he wins Sunday, Mr. Macron could struggle to secure enough support for his upstart platform En Marche (""On the Move""), which is barely a year old, if he can't field strong enough candidates in the legislative elections in June. This could hamper his pro-market agenda, investors say.

Meanwhile, Ms. Le Pen's simple presence in the debate is ""important, symbolically, in the long run,"" said Bastien Drut, strategist at Paris-based Amundi, Europe's largest money manager with more than 1 trillion euros under supervision, because it shows that Europe might grapple with anti-globalization parties for years to come.

When Ms. Le Pen's father, far-right firebrand Jean-Marie Le Pen, got through to the second round in 2002, his contender, Jacques Chirac -- who ended up winning with 82% of the vote -- refused to debate with him at all.

""Fifteen years ago, this was unthinkable,"" Mr. Drut added."
Ctit Group,The Economy's Vital Signs Start to Flag --- Weak data cast doubt on expectations; some investors see a slowdown ahead," May 3, 2017",1,"A soft patch in the economy is damping expectations for a stimulus-driven, postelection boom, prompting many investors to retreat from bets on growth.

The first quarter marked the weakest U.S. growth in three years, according to the initial Commerce Department reading on Friday.

The Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, the personal-consumption expenditures price index, dropped 0.2% in March from a month earlier, pushing annual increases back below the central bank's 2% target, data showed Monday. Even longtime economic bright spots such as consumer spending and car sales have recently begun to fade, with sales at General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. declining sharply in April.

Economists say these signs run counter to the bets on faster growth under President Donald Trump that fueled a postelection stock rally, reflecting early excitement about the likely impact of potential tax cuts, deregulation and infrastructure spending.

Investment managers are tempering their optimism, with 44% saying in a Northern Trust survey taken in late March that they expect the economy to accelerate over the next six months, down from 55% in the previous quarter.

""Moderate is going to be as good as it gets for the near term, with a longer-term outlook suggesting even weaker growth,"" said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Financial Corp.

Ms. Piegza believes the economy will expand at about 1.5% annually for the next year or two before a recession takes hold.

That has implications for the Fed, which is set to keep rates unchanged when it concludes its May policy meeting on Wednesday. Investors have penciled in two more rate increases before the end of the year, with fed-funds futures showing 70% chances of a June increase.

Some see the slowdown as a passing phase. For years, the first quarter has been weak for GDP growth, raising questions about the Commerce Department's seasonal adjustment methodology and fueling expectations for a rebound in the April-to-June period. The economy could well get a boost if the White House and Congress pass a tax-overhaul bill or other measures that encourage spending, some investors say.

Others expect the Fed to continue raising rates, noting that a falling U.S. dollar, near-record stock prices and narrow junk-bond spreads all point to loose financial conditions.

But the souring in the current outlook reflects the evolution of a broader postcrisis trend, in which the economy has expanded steadily while struggling to expand at an annual pace above 3%. The U.S. is in one of its longest periods of expansion since World War II, but many fear that the economy will struggle to maintain even its modest pace of growth, much less accelerate rapidly.

Lacy Hunt, executive vice president at Hoisington Investment Management Co. in Austin, Texas, noted that the supply of highly liquid money, called M2, an indicator of overall demand, has increased at a below-average annual rate of 5.5% over the three months that ended in mid-April, down from 6.8% in 2016. M2's pace tends to rise and fall with demand for goods and services.

Another measure of the relationship between money and GDP, known as velocity, hit a record low in the first three months of the year after more than a decade of decline. In effect, for each increase in the money supply, the associated increase in gross domestic product is smaller.

Together with decelerating credit growth, tightening lending standards and a rising fed-funds rate, slowing money growth and velocity suggest softer economic growth ahead, Mr. Hunt said.

""We're headed for a severe slowdown and the risk of an accident is high,"" he said.

Citigroup Inc.'s U.S. economic surprise index, which turns positive when data in aggregate are beating economists' forecasts and negative when they are missing expectations, turned negative on Friday for the first time since the week after the election. In mid-March, the index was at its highest since early 2014.

Tom Forester, chief investment officer at Forester Capital Management, is largely shunning stocks that are trading at high prices relative to their earnings, because economic growth doesn't show signs of accelerating. Recently, he has also stayed away from retail stocks, which are sensitive to a weakening economy and suffering from a deeper shift away from brick-and-mortar shopping. He suspects these declines could point to broader slowing.

""We've peaked and started rolling over on a lot of these things like auto sales, factory usage and homes,"" said Mr. Forester."
Ctit Group,"Goldman Sachs Embraces Lending's Bland Side --- The investment bank, seeking growth beyond its elite turf, turns to lending; takeovers to remodels"," May 2, 2017",0,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc. earned its elite reputation by dominating the glamorous end of finance -- investment banking, trading and managing money for the wealthy.

In the postcrisis world of Wall Street, however, these standbys aren't providing the growth it wants. So Goldman is expanding its reach with a prosaic strategy it once avoided.

Lending people money.

The firm has been opening its checkbook for the past several years to finance corporate takeovers, lend against mansions and art, and make personal loans for things such as kitchen remodels and fixing broken windshields.

It is exploring new credit businesses such as trade finance, equipment leasing and extending credit that consumers use for online purchases, according to people familiar with the discussions.

""We're a bank,"" Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said in a February interview. ""We should act like one.""

That Goldman is branching out, after long sticking to its knitting as rivals diversified, shows the challenges facing Wall Street this decade. Investors have been rewarding firms with diverse businesses that churn out safe, if smaller, profits. Most in the finance industry believe trading revenues will never return to precrisis levels.

Goldman ranks among Wall Street's top players in its core businesses, such as advising on corporate mergers and underwriting stock sales, offering little room for growth. In lending, ""we can only go up,"" said Stephen Scherr, who oversees the effort as CEO of Goldman Sachs Bank USA.

Loans outstanding across Goldman have doubled to $95 billion since 2011, filings show. Real-estate loans are up 10-fold. Business lending has tripled, while loans in its private-wealth division, secured by everything from stock portfolios to rare artwork, have quadrupled. Goldman doesn't report revenues tied to lending, which remains a small part of its overall business.

""It's not quite Bailey Savings & Loan,"" said Glenn Schorr, a research analyst who covers banks, ""but it's getting closer.""

The pivot has brought cultural shifts to a firm ruled by hard-charging deal makers and traders. Mr. Scherr recruited executives from finance arenas foreign to Goldman's world -- from Discover Financial Services, Capital One Financial Corp., regional banks and online lenders.

Into a firm known for courting the financial elite, he hired executives skilled at selling to the masses -- from underwear retailer Jockey International, food-delivery app GrubHub Inc., concert promoter Live Nation Entertainment Inc. In January, Goldman reorganized several hundred employees into a new division reporting to Mr. Scherr named Consumer and Commercial Banking.

Some Goldman investment bankers have privately grumbled at being cast as small-town lenders. Other current and former executives say the push is misguided, exposing Goldman to a new risk -- the American borrower -- in hopes of collecting a few nickels on the dollar.

Goldman's lending push comes as the financial system is awash in capital and demand for new loans is starting to flag. What's more, entrenched lenders such as Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. have deep relationships with CFOs and treasurers, who typically decide which banks to borrow from.

""When you need money and you pick up the red phone, it goes to J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Citi,"" said Tom Deas, former treasurer of chemicals maker FMC Corp. and now chairman of the National Association of Corporate Treasurers. ""That will be slow to change.""

Last month, Goldman got a reminder of why it must find new ways to make money. Its trading desk stumbled badly, reporting weak quarterly numbers that Chief Financial Officer R. Martin Chavez said ""served as a reminder of the benefits of having a diversified global client franchise.""

Goldman's push to lend -- still in its early days -- further blurs the lines that separated investment banks like it from commercial banks. The former made money on their wits, brokering deals and trading securities; the latter took depositors' cash and lent it, pocketing the difference.

Goldman began as a lender. In the 1870s, its immigrant founder Marcus Goldman sold short-term credit known as commercial paper to merchants along Manhattan's wharves.

As the firm grew, it focused on brokering deals and trading big slugs of stock, arenas where the fees were larger and the field less crowded. Goldman's specialty was turning over capital quickly, squeezing profit from the same dollar again and again. By contrast, lending money locked it up for years.

""We were in the moving business,"" Mr. Scherr said, ""not the storage business.""

After Congress in 1999 repealed a Depression-era law that had kept the two separate, J.P. Morgan, Citigroup and other commercial banks barreled into Goldman strongholds such as trading and underwriting, where margins were fatter.

Goldman decided not to reciprocate and challenge its commercial cousins on their turf. It lacked a big cache of retail deposits to fund loans cheaply, and its executives tended to view lending as pedestrian and commoditized -- a business built on brawn, not brains.

While rivals sent armies of lending specialists to Main Street, Goldman's M.B.A.s and Ph.D. ""quants"" stuck to doling out high-touch services to companies, hedge funds and governments. The firm rode one Wall Street wave after another to huge profits.

It did make occasional loans, principally to wealthy or corporate clients it hoped to keep close.

The first seeds of change were sown over a hectic September 2008 weekend. With its shares tanking and clients pulling cash, Goldman ceased to be an investment bank. Under pressure from the Federal Reserve, it legally converted to a commercial bank, gaining access to cheap government cash that calmed panicky investors.

Goldman welcomed the lifeline but had little interest in retail or commercial banking. Some executives debated trying to shed the firm's new status, which had brought additional federal oversight. The newly created banking entity sat mostly empty.

The postcrisis world proved a harder place to make money, amid new regulation, a global recession and low interest rates. Bond-trading revenues, a huge driver of profits, fell to $8.7 billion in 2013 from $21.9 billion in 2009. Mr. Blankfein, CEO since 2006, began pushing executives to find ways to grow.

Some floated the notion of moving into traditional lending, but there was still resistance. David Viniar, Goldman's long-serving chief financial officer, was skeptical of lending, according to people familiar with Mr. Viniar's position. He kept a toaster in his office as a reminder of Main Street banking gimmicks to avoid. Mr. Viniar left the post in 2013, remains on Goldman's board and supports the firm's current efforts.

At a management off-site in the Hamptons in the summer of 2014, executives batted around ideas for growth, according to people familiar with the meeting. Some made a case for looking for new revenues by using Goldman Sachs Bank USA, the legal entity created at regulatory gunpoint in 2008.

Goldman was being regulated like a Main Street bank, they argued, but wasn't reaping the benefits. What's more, they said, politicians had many Wall Street activities in their crosshairs but tended to view lending as a social good, helping small businesses thrive and families make ends meet.

""The feeling was that nobody was going to get hauled in front of Congress"" for writing simple loans, one executive remembers. Several Goldman officials had testified in Washington about the bank's crisis-era mortgage-trading activities, a scarring episode for the firm's image.

Mr. Scherr, whom Mr. Blankfein tapped to lead the effort, began assembling a team. He recruited Harit Talwar from Discover, the credit-card giant, and Dustin Cohn, Jockey's head of marketing.

Goldman launched a business last fall to make online loans of a few thousand dollars to individuals. Named Marcus, after Goldman's credit-selling founder, it targets borrowers carrying high levels of credit-card debt and offers to refinance at lower rates. It has lent about $1 billion in its first six months.

Years ago, Goldman would likely have ""securitized"" the loans, bundling them, slicing them up and selling the pieces. That would have freed up those loan dollars to be used elsewhere and earned lucrative fees for Goldman's traders. In perhaps the most striking sign of Goldman's newfound taste for plain-vanilla banking, the firm plans to keep the loans and pocket the interest payments.

""It's hard to get more boring than that,"" said Mr. Schorr, the analyst.

Goldman's lending push also extends into its investment bank, which advises companies on mergers and fundraising. It is the firm's second-largest division by revenue and its most profitable.

For decades, Goldman's bankers specialized in negotiating the sale of their clients to corporate buyers. Fees on the ""sell side"" are predictable, but usually lower than those earned by the acquiring company's banks, which raise debt to fund takeovers. Goldman earned $56 million for advising Botox maker Allergan on its 2015 sale; J.P. Morgan earned more than $200 million arranging a loan for the buyer, Actavis PLC.

Goldman has subtly pivoted in such deals, angling for a larger share of the fees that come from providing the money, not just advice, for deals. ""That was the white space on the map,"" said John Waldron, who runs the investment-banking unit in the U.S.

In late 2015, when Goldman's top retail-industry banker, Kathy Elsesser, was talking to Newell Rubbermaid Inc. about buying rival Jarden Corp., she brought colleagues who specialized in raising debt to early meetings. Their message, according to people who attended: ""We can do this. You don't have to go to"" a big commercial lender.

The $10.5 billion check Goldman wrote Newell to finance the deal was the bank's single largest loan ever. That was topped last summer by an $11.4 billion loan commitment backing Bayer AG's acquisition of Monsanto Co. Goldman ranked third last year in arranging loans for U.S. deals, up from ninth in 2012, according to Dealogic.

Much of that debt is sliced up and sold quickly, so Goldman doesn't carry much risk. Overall, though, corporate loans held on the firm's books grew to $28.7 billion in 2016 from $15.0 billion in 2014, filings show.

In its push to lend more, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is entering the unsexy world of rainy-day credit to companies.

It is one of the worst businesses on Wall Street because fees are low and companies tend to draw on the loans only when in trouble. Banks make these ""relationship loans"" in hopes of building client loyalty for better work later.

Goldman historically declined to play that game, even when marquee assignments were at stake. In 2001, it didn't participate in a loan Kraft Foods was raising. Some Goldman executives suspected it cost Goldman a coveted role on Kraft's IPO that year, then the second-largest in history.

That wouldn't happen today, said Susie Scher, Goldman's top banker for investment-grade debt. ""It's a cultural shift,"" she said. ""The mentality now is that we have to lend to support our clients.""

Still more lending initiatives are planned. Goldman executives have discussed adding trade finance, which companies use to import and export goods, and are looking for new ways to lend to individuals, perhaps by making car loans or advancing money for online purchases, people familiar with the firm said.

Funding the firms' loans is a growing stash of deposits. Goldman for years financed activities by borrowing against holdings of securities, a strategy that left it exposed during the financial crisis. It branched out in 2016, buying an online savings-account platform from General Electric Co. and began taking retail deposits for the first time. Meanwhile, it has been gathering more of its corporate and wealthy clients' extra cash.

Deposits have increased to $124 billion in 2016 from $28 billion in 2008, still a fraction of J.P. Morgan's $1.4 trillion.

Still, it is slow going overall. When AT&T Inc. needed $40 billion in debt to buy Time Warner Inc., it called J.P. Morgan and Bank of America Corp. Goldman executives chafed at the miss, said people familiar with the bank, which left it out of 2016's biggest takeover.

There is also a danger that Goldman, hungry for market share, takes on risky assignments. Two financing deals for private-equity buyouts last year earned Goldman a formal reprimand from banking regulators who felt the companies would carry too much debt. A third was rejected by bond investors, who forced Goldman's client to pay a higher interest rate.

And lending to consumers can be risky, especially because Goldman is targeting those already heavily in debt. Goldman is entering the space amid new cracks in the market: Store-card issuer Synchrony Financial and Capital One both set aside hundreds of millions of extra dollars last quarter to cover an expected rise in credit-card delinquencies.

""If you are driven by investment-banking mentality, retail banking, in the main, is different,"" said Deanna Oppenheimer, who ran Barclays PLC's retail operations and now runs a financial-services consulting firm. ""The products are simple, but the complexity is in the scale, and it's not a slam-dunk that they get that right."""
Ctit Group,Lenders Seek Change To a Measure of Risk," May 1, 2017",0,"Tucked inside a nearly 600-page legislative proposal to overhaul U.S. financial regulations are 93 words that could provide a windfall for bank investors seeking heftier dividends and share buybacks.

The words are contained in the bill to repeal and replace the Dodd-Frank Act, formally introduced last Wednesday by Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.

The section relates to an area of bank capital known as operational risk, a concept regulators have used since the financial crisis to measure the possibility that a bank's own actions, rather than unfavorable economic or market movements, could sink it. Operational risk is largely influenced by a bank's previous missteps, such as big legal settlements, and could require it to hold more capital.

While obscure and technical, the result is that the sins of the past linger on big banks' balance sheets. Bank analysts at Barclays PLC estimate $236 billion in capital is tied up in operational risk at the four biggest U.S. lenders alone.

Bankers have become increasingly vocal in urging regulators, lawmakers and the Trump administration to change the way risk is measured. They want to free up capital that could be returned to shareholders or used for more lending.

James Dimon, chief executive of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., lashed out at the requirements in his recent annual letter to shareholders, saying regulators' approach ""should be significantly modified if not eliminated."" At the bank's investor day in February, he called operational risk a ""false number.""

The shareholders letter highlights that operational risk in 2016 increased J.P. Morgan's assets adjusted for risk by $400 billion. Mr. Dimon added that U.S. banks hold about $200 billion in capital against operational risk.

One big gripe banks have is the backward-looking nature of the rules. Citigroup Inc., for example, still holds capital against operational risks in businesses it has been winding down since the crisis.

At Bank of America Corp., a big portion of the firm's operational-risk exposure stems from its purchase of Countrywide Financial, the defunct subprime lender for which it has paid billions of dollars in fines and settlements. Operational risk accounted for $500 billion of the bank's $1.5 trillion in risk-weighted assets at the end of 2016.

Bankers said it doesn't make sense to continue holding capital for such problems. Citigroup's finance chief, John Gerspach, last year said, ""When you incur an operational loss, it has got a plutonium-238 half-life.""

Others argue the lasting imprint reflects the outsize role banks played in fueling the financial crisis. ""The fines banks paid in the past may well be indicative of future risk,"" said Anat Admati, finance professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business.""There are enormous rates of recidivism in corporate misconduct. Paying a fine need not lead to significant change.""

So how does operational risk affect banks?

By some regulatory measures, the amount of capital a bank has to hold is based on total assets, which are then adjusted to reflect their risk. In some cases, this reduces the weighting of an asset because it is deemed so safe, for example U.S. Treasurys. In others, though, it inflates the size of an asset because it is seen as being very risky.

Operational risk does the latter. That ends up forcing banks to hold more capital.

Consider a bank with $1.5 trillion in risk-weighted assets and a requirement to have a 10% capital buffer. It would need $150 billion in capital.

Say then that operational risk makes up one-third of those risk-weighted assets. If operational risk was eliminated, risk-weighted assets would fall to $1 trillion and require capital of $100 billion -- freeing up $50 billion.

Granted, it is unlikely operational-risk weighting would be eliminated entirely should rules change.

But even a modest reduction could prove meaningful and free up capital.

Operational-risk weightings at five of the biggest U.S. banks are on average equal to about 29% of their risk-weighted assets. Combined, their $1.5 trillion of operational risk is equal to about 18% of the banks' total assets.

Ironically, moves by banks in recent years to slash holdings of assets that carry lots of market or credit risk have increased the effect of operational risk. In 2014 operational risk represented just 18% of those five banks' overall risk-weighted assets.

That's a contrast to the trend in banks' legal payouts. At J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, and Bank of America, litigation expenses were around $2 billion last year, down from $28 billion in 2014, according to analysts at Compass Point Research & Trading LLC."
Ctit Group,An Inflation Surprise in Eurozone," May 1, 2017",1,"Can the eurozone take up the reflation baton? Inflation data for April, released Friday, were surprisingly strong. This could shake the perception that eurozone inflation is going nowhere.

Headline eurozone inflation rose to 1.9% in April from 1.5% in March, according to Eurostat, matching the European Central Bank's inflation target. The real surprise, however, was in underlying core inflation -- which excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco. That rose from 0.7% to 1.2%, its highest reading since 2013. Services inflation jumped even more sharply, from 1% to 1.8%, another four-year high.

The increase was bigger than expected. The FactSet consensus forecast for core inflation was 1%.

Moreover, broader measures of eurozone inflation have been beating economists' expectations for six months now, according to Citigroup's inflation surprise index. The mantra has been that underlying price pressures remain subdued, a message that ECB President Mario Draghi repeated Thursday.

But consistent surprises tell a story of their own: They should start to change expectations. That is what the ECB wants to see in its battle to restore headline inflation sustainably to a rate of below but close to 2%.

April's inflation data thus raise the stakes for coming months. Europe isn't playing out according to the script for this year. Political shocks are notable for their absence, while economic surprises are continuing to be pleasant. That is a potentially powerful combination for investors."
Ctit Group,"Banking &amp; Finance: For Banks, Tax Cut Has Minuses, Pluses"," Apr 27, 2017",1,"A cut in the corporate tax rate would involve immediate pain for some big banks, namely Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp., but an eventual earnings boost should more than make up for that.

A corporate tax cut from the current 35% to 15%, which the White House proposed Wednesday, would lower companies' tax bills and fatten their bottom lines.

A lower tax rate would mean banks like Citigroup and Bank of America would have to take billions of dollars in charges against earnings to write down the value of their giant piles of deferred tax assets.

These assets consist of tax credits or deductions that typically spawned from big losses, like those the banks experienced during the financial crisis. They are essentially IOUs the banks can use to defray future tax bills.

If those tax bills are reduced in the future by a rate cut, the deferred tax assets would be worth less. That could lead Citigroup to write down their value by anywhere from $6 billion to $12 billion, based on some figures the bank has provided and analysts' calculations and depending on the ultimate contours of a tax-rate overhaul. Bank of America's hit could be around $4 billion.

Citigroup had $46.7 billion of net deferred tax assets as of the end of 2016, while Bank of America had $19.2 billion.

The hit to earnings would be a one-time event, though. The offset is that the banks ""are going to make more money for life,"" said John McDonald, a bank analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ""What the market does care about is earnings, and their earnings would be permanently improved.""

In fact, the gain to the banks' bottom lines from lower tax rates means they could potentially recoup the value of the write-downs in a year or two.

The banks ""should be willing to make the trade-off,"" said Michelle Hanlon, an accounting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management.

What's more, deferred tax assets are complex and it will take time to gauge just how much of a write-down banks will have to take.

Much of Citigroup's net deferred tax assets, for example, consist of state or foreign deductions and credits or other assets that wouldn't be affected by a cut in the federal tax rate.

John Gerspach, the bank's chief financial officer, told analysts last November that a drop to a 25% corporate tax rate could translate into a charge of roughly $6 billion.

A reduction in the rate to 15% could raise the write-down to $10 billion, Bernstein analysts estimated."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp; Finance: Citigroup Holders Approve Pay Plan," Apr 26, 2017",1,"Citigroup Inc. shareholders cast 95% of their votes at Tuesday's annual meeting in support of the bank's compensation plan for top executives, following a jump in the stock price and a pay cut for Chief Executive Michael Corbat.

That reversed tepid support last year, when the bank's annual ""say on pay"" resolution received 64% of votes cast. The average bank in the S&P 500 index received 91% support, according to proxy-advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.

In contrast to a rancorous Wells Fargo & Co. annual shareholder meeting that also took place Tuesday, Citigroup's conclave was relatively placid. But it wasn't totally uneventful: There was one major interruption when a group took the stage at the Cooper Union hall in New York for a few minutes to protest the bank's lending related to the l Dakota Access Pipeline.

Otherwise, Citigroup shareholders backed the bank's overall strategy, overwhelmingly rejecting a breakup proposal. The current board also received more than 98% support from voters. The breakup measure got 2.5% of votes cast, down from 3.5% last year.

A more extensive debate on the bank's performance could await Citigroup in July, when it will hold its first investor day meeting in several years.

The bank succeeded in tamping down the major concern at last year's meeting, executive pay. Following last year's say-on-pay vote -- which isn't binding but an indication of shareholder support -- Citigroup's board made a handful of changes.

For one, it cut Mr. Corbat's pay. For 2016, Mr. Corbat is expected to receive total compensation of $15.5 million, a 6% decrease from the previous year.

That helped the bank match up more favorably with its stock performance and peers. The cut came despite Citigroup stock generating a 16% total return in 2016 compared with negative 4% in 2015, when Mr. Corbat's pay rose.

Last year, proxy-advisory firms Glass Lewis & Co. and ISS recommended that shareholders vote against the say-on-pay resolution. This year, both firms recommended voting in favor, citing the measures the bank took after last year's vote.

""The board has demonstrated sufficient responsiveness,"" ISS said in a report this month.

Like most big banks, Citigroup's stock has jumped since the U.S. presidential election, partly on hopes that the Trump administration will give firms a wider berth to return capital.

Citigroup returned $11 billion to shareholders last year and expects to increase that amount. Mr. Corbat told shareholders that Citigroup pressed the case for a bigger payout when the bank made its 2017 stress-test submission to regulators.

The company made other changes after the 2016 vote, including shifting more pay from cash to stock and basing future performance-based stock grants partly on 2019 return on capital and profitability.

Mr. Corbat acknowledged that the bank fell short on several measures in 2016, such as declines in net income and return on assets.

He said that was driven by decisions to make new investments in several areas, including credit cards, consumer banking in Mexico and stock trading, which will generate faster growth and capital return."
Ctit Group,The Shattered Arguments for a New Glass-Steagall," Apr 26, 2017",1,"Gary Cohn may not be the first White House official you'd expect to favor reinstating Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that split commercial banks from investment banks. Yet Mr. Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs president who now leads the National Economic Council, urged just that in a private meeting with lawmakers, according to Bloomberg News. This is deeply disappointing, particularly coming from an administration that seeks to stimulate growth by removing the government shackles that suppress competition and burden markets.

The 1999 repeal of Glass-Steagall was unfairly blamed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Some people -- apparently Mr. Cohn among them -- mistakenly believe that investment banking is so risky that it should be once again kept separate from commercial banking. The truth is exactly the opposite: Traditional investment banking entails very little risk. The danger is stand-alone investment banks that are not diversified enough to survive a shock.

Traditional investment banks primarily underwrite debt and equity for corporations; provide advice on mergers, acquisitions and divestitures; buy and sell securities for institutions; and help clients hedge their risks. These activities involve almost no risk on the investment banks' own books. In contrast, commercial banks extend credit to people and businesses and retain a good deal of both the credit risk and the interest-rate risk. The repeal of Glass-Steagall allowed these banks to diversify their risks and revenues by providing fee-based investment services.

Banks are at risk of failure when they become too concentrated by geography, industry or product line. Risk needs to be diversified so that no one mistake can bring down the entire institution. Even firms like Citigroup and Bank of America that made a series of mistakes in the 2008 crisis survived because they were diversified. Investment banks that were not properly diversified did not survive: Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch.

The major perpetrators of the 2008 financial crisis were 20 or so institutions that had originated, securitized and distributed exotic subprime mortgages with toxic features. About 10 investment banks packaged mortgages made by savings-and-loan associations such as Countrywide, Washington Mutual and Indy Mac, and by state-chartered mortgage brokers -- many of which committed outright fraud. These S&Ls were the remnants of an industry that had cost taxpayers some $150 billion during the 1980s and early 1990s. Notably absent from this array of culprits were large commercial banks, with an exception or two.

Unfortunately, regulators failed to see or act on the growing problems until they had escalated into a full-scale financial crisis. The Securities and Exchange Commission failed to enforce adequate capital and liquidity requirements on investment banks, including Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, which had trillion-dollar balance sheets funded by volatile and expensive short-term wholesale funds.

As a consequence of the crisis, the offending investment banks and S&Ls were sold, liquidated or converted into regulated banking companies. The financial system has stabilized at historically high capital levels and the economy is growing again (albeit much too slowly).

Today there are no major stand-alone investment banks engaged in high-risk trading for their own accounts. After much turmoil and hundreds of billions of dollars in losses, they are finally gone. Investment banking now either is part of the regulated commercial-banking industry or is conducted in small boutique firms that are not highly leveraged. A separate hedge-fund industry exists for private investors interested in proprietary trading, private equity, exotic securitizations, and other high-risk businesses.

This is a positive change for the safety and soundness of the financial system. Yet almost unbelievably, there are calls to restore Glass-Steagall, re-create stand-alone investment banks, and allow them to operate once again outside the regulated banking system. The administration and Congress should not even consider putting America's economy at risk that way again."
Ctit Group,"The Future of Finance (A Special Report) --- Personal Banking Becomes Even More Personal: Financial institutions know a lot about their customers, and they are eager to make more use of that knowledge"," Apr 25, 2017",1,"Banks know more about their customers than ever, and increasingly are trying to get more use out of that information.

The results can be convenient, or just creepy.

Banks can look at customers' debit-card and credit-card transactions, online-bill payments and account activity to see what they're buying, who they're working for and other information. Now, from the largest Wall Street behemoths to small community lenders, the banks are looking to use that data in new ways, investing in more-advanced technology to better target prospective customers and sell more services to existing ones.

Such moves have been a long time coming in an industry not known for embracing technological change. But banks are under increasing pressure from well-funded startups that make snap lending decisions based on such unorthodox metrics as a customer's online-shopping record.

Developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning are giving the banks more firepower to spot patterns in financial or personal issues a consumer might be having. Online bill payments, call-center interactions and online chats with customer-service representatives have given the banks more data to play with than ever before.

But access by banks to so much personal information raises concerns about privacy and consumers' rights in this era of big data and the Internet of Everything. Richard Cordray, head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said at a recent industry conference that banks need to be careful about how they use and store customer data. ""We see the market moving quickly, with high stakes for all involved,"" Mr. Cordray says. New rules regarding data privacy are also on the way in Europe.

Some big players are already being careful as a result of what they know. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. is using customer data to determine when not to bug its customers. For instance, the bank doesn't want to pitch a new credit card to a customer who has recently been the victim of card-related fraud.

Generally speaking, though, banks, including Chase, know they are sitting on a large deposit of gold -- and they intend to mine it.

Chase, the largest U.S. bank by assets, tailors offers based on what it knows about customers' wealth, family size and recent spending and borrowing patterns, bank executives say.

""The last thing we want to do is sell somebody a product they don't want, or don't qualify for,"" says Kristin Lemkau, chief marketing officer at Chase. ""We want to strengthen the relationship, not cheapen"" it.

That means connecting the dots in ways customers feel comfortable with.

""If someone is buying a lot of things at the home-improvement store. . .maybe we should call them up and ask if they need a home-equity line, versus the old days, where everyone who walked into the branch, we would say, 'Hey, do you need a home-equity line?' "" says Bob Hedges, a partner at consulting firm A.T. Kearney.

Fifth Third Bancorp plans to experiment with cellphone location technology that will allow the bank to send customers a text message when they are close to a branch and encourage them to stop by.

Melissa Stevens, Fifth Third's chief digital officer, says her bank will move cautiously. ""There's that balance,"" she says. ""You want to show that you're utilizing and embracing new technologies, but you also don't want to freak people out and accidentally alienate customers.""

Contacts that make consumers look over their shoulders may still be welcome as long as the messages are appropriate or useful, bankers say. Rob Lee, chief product officer for banking and payments at financial-technology company FIS, says his company is helping banks with just-in-time marketing. If a bank notices a customer eating lunch at different college campuses all week, it might send offers or news about student loans, he says. Or customers who keep spending money on car repairs might be receptive to messages about how to qualify for a car loan.

Other pressures, besides competition from startups, are pushing banks to mine their data for more opportunities. For decades, they were more interested in buying other banks to become bigger, then integrating the target bank's technology to cut costs. The financial crisis largely put an end to such deals; now banks are looking inward to their relationships with customers.

When Wells Fargo & Co. customers have their paycheck deposited by a different employer, these days they might get asked if they need help switching their 401(k) over from the previous employer, says Charles Thomas, the bank's chief data officer. A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, which in September settled with regulators over charges that it opened accounts using fictitious or unauthorized customer information, says that data is helping it prevent fraud, process speedier transactions and make basic recommendations. The bank also hopes to use newer tools including artificial intelligence to do things like send customers text alerts about unusual transactions or offer virtual financial advisers.

At Citigroup Inc., the bank knows when customers have redeemed credit-card points for travel rewards, and in response it highlights travel options like flights and hotels when reminding those customers to redeem more points.

Some banks are hiring data-analytics firms to help them find out more about their customers, using data they already have. When First Financial Bancorp, a community lender based in Cincinnati, discovered that many of its customers weren't tapping the home-equity lines of credit they opened at the bank, it asked Segmint Inc., a data-driven marketing firm based in Akron, Ohio, to analyze those customers' credit-card transactions, online bill payments and other information. Then it started targeting those customers with messages based on what it thought would interest them. To some the bank sent messages noting that the money from a home-equity line would be a great way to help with home repairs. To others, it encouraged using the money to travel.

The project so far has increased the usage rate on the home-equity loans, says Lynda Crossan, vice president of marketing.

Not every profitable use of customer data requires an analytical or technological approach.

In 2014, Wells Fargo started sending birthday notes to customers via its mobile app. The following year, tellers in branches started offering birthday wishes as well. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman says customers ""love the personal touch."""
Ctit Group,More Chips to Play in This Sector," Apr 24, 2017",0,"Good news for the party raging in the semiconductor-manufacturing-gear business: Last call still seems to be a ways off.

Investors have good reason to wonder. A cyclical industry that depends mostly on a few big customers to foot the bill, semiconductor capital equipment has been on a tear of late.

The two largest companies by market value, Applied Materials and Lam Research, have increased sales steadily over the past three years and are expected to deliver double-digit growth this year. Their share prices are up 90% and 73%, respectively, over the past 12 months. KLA-Tencor has risen 40% since its merger with Lam was called off in October due to opposition from regulators.

For those accustomed to the boom-and-bust cycles of this industry, gains like these might seem a good time to take some chips off the table. But the chip-making business is in the midst of a somewhat unprecedented up cycle -- one that looks to last well into next year at least.

Most different this time is the market for flash memory, which is shifting to a new production process called 3D NAND. This has caused a supply shortage that has boosted NAND spot prices by 42% over the past 12 months, according to DRAMeXchange.

It also has spurred demand for equipment as memory makers upgrade their fabs. Wes Twigg of Pacific Crest projects that capital expenditures for Flash memory production will jump 25% this year. Atif Malik of Citigroup said he expects the current supply-demand balance to ""remain tight"" through 2018, which will likely keep pricing strong through then.

Last week, Lam Research reported a 64% jump in revenue year over year for its fiscal third quarter ended March 26. That is the biggest gain seen by the company in six years. Demand for 3D NAND gear was credited as a major reason. Applied Materials is expected to see a 43% jump in revenue for the fiscal quarter that ends this month. KLA-Tencor, which has less exposure to the flash market, is still expected to post a 26% jump in sales for the March quarter when it reports results later this week.

Demand for 3D NAND gear should extend well beyond the near term. In Lam's earnings call, CEO Martin Anstice said he expects just a little over half the installed base of NAND production equipment to be converted to 3D NAND by the end of the year -- thus leaving plenty of upside for next year.

And despite their recent gains, shares of Lam and Applied Materials are still trading at slight discounts to the peer-weighted PHLX Semiconductor Index as a multiple of forward earnings. This rally still has some flash left in it."
Ctit Group,"Oil Prices Stop Swinging for Now --- Commodity has been volatile in the past two years, but that has changed in 2017"," Apr 20, 2017",1,"The wild price swings that characterized the oil market for much of the past two years have faded in 2017, a welcome development for stock and bond investors whose holdings tend to suffer when crude turns volatile.

U.S. oil prices traded in a range of $50.82 to $54.45 a barrel for most of the past four months. No 60-day trading range has been that tight in nearly 14 years.

Two opposing forces have trapped oil prices in that narrow band: Production cuts by the major producing nations have limited price declines while growing U.S. supply has held rallies in check.

That doesn't mean the market is free from the occasional big price swing. Crude futures declined 3.8% on Wednesday after a surprising increase in U.S. gasoline stockpiles. But even those losses weren't enough to knock prices below $50 a barrel, and traders and investors are still betting that the market will remain stable in coming weeks.

The low volatility is a stark change from the previous two years, when prices often swung $10 or more monthly, as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ramped up production to compete with U.S. shale drillers. Prices fell from $100 a barrel to less than $30 before rebounding last year after OPEC began to explore reductions to output.

Oil-price stability is a bullish indicator for other financial markets, many investors say. Fuel and shipping are major costs for businesses, so big swings in energy prices can impair planning, said David Rolley, co-head of global fixed income for money manager Loomis Sayles & Co., which has $250 billion in assets.

A stable price ""makes us more optimistic about global growth,"" Mr. Rolley said, as businesses invest more and energy companies face a lower risk of bankruptcy.

Earnings growth for oil-and-gas companies could hit double digits in the first quarter of 2017, said Joseph Tanious, senior investment strategist for Bessemer Trust. ""When oil prices were dipping lower, that was having a drag on the overall results for the S&P 500,"" he said. ""Now we're seeing the opposite of that.""

Energy shares in the S&P 500 rose 24% in 2016. That made them last year's top-performing sector and helped boost the broader market, though these stocks have given back some of those gains this year.

Bond markets also have enjoyed a lift from oil. High-yield debt tends to move alongside crude prices because smaller energy companies have issued $190 billion of outstanding junk bonds, accounting for 15% of the U.S. high-yield market, according to research from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Dozens of these borrowers went bankrupt during the oil-price collapse.

The oil crisis forced many of those companies to cut costs, sell future production and assets, raise new equity and refinance debt. Rebounding prices stabilized their finances and steadied the high-yield market.

Markets have been steadier than they were in early 2016, when stocks and many commodities plunged amid fears that a global recession was at hand. Crude prices dropped 9% over three days in March but otherwise have been largely stable.

Options traders are betting that volatility in the next three months will hit its lowest levels since the autumn of 2014.

Not everyone has been pleased by the lack of volatility: Executives at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said during a Tuesday earnings call that stable oil prices meant fewer opportunities to make wagers on large price moves, hitting earnings.

And some investors remain unconvinced that volatility is going away. Oil's trading range is pricing in an OPEC decision to extend its production cuts for another six months, brokers and traders said. If OPEC reconsiders, that could send prices back to near $40 a barrel, analysts at Citigroup Inc. said last week."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp; Finance: Premium Card Battle Intensifies," Apr 20, 2017",1,"American Express Co.'s Platinum card is going to get even more competition.

U.S. Bancorp plans on May 1 to launch a premium card geared toward high spenders and millennials. This adds to the threats facing AmEx in a card category where it was until recently unrivaled.

AmEx launched the Platinum card in 1984 and for decades remained the only large force in the premium rewards card market. That changed in 2013 when Citigroup Inc. launched its Prestigecard; the pressure intensified last year after J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. launched its Sapphire Reserve card.

The hugely popular Sapphire Reserve offered a large sign-up bonus and a generous points system that in many ways trumped the Platinum card and has become a must-have with many millennials. AmEx has since upgraded its card benefits three times, though the company says the moves were in the works before the Sapphire Reserve launch.

Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp is less of a national threat to AmEx. But if ""U.S. Bank is thinking about it, then PNC [Financial Services Group Inc.] is thinking about it, KeyBank is thinking about it, and it means the barrier to entry is low, anybody can roll out"" one of these cards, said Vincent Caintic, managing director at investment banking firm Stephens Inc. who follows AmEx.

Called the Altitude Reserve Visa Infinite, U.S. Bancorp's card will offer three points per dollar spent on airfare, hotels and other travel categories and three points per dollar on any category when cardholders make the purchases with their mobile wallets. The card will cost $400 a year, which is lower than the $550 a year AmEx charges for the Platinum card or the $450 for a Sapphire Reserve card.

Like AmEx's card, the Altitude Reserve claims a host of benefits including access to celebrity chef tours, upgrades at high-end hotels, a concierge service for dinner, sports events and other reservations, as well as help with hotel and airfare bookings and free in-flight wi-fi. The card also offers points for spending with smartphone wallets, such as Apple Pay or Samsung Pay, which the bank is hoping will resonate with millennials.

Rivals have piled into the premium-card market to boost purchase volume among creditworthy borrowers. Consumers who sign up for these cards tend to be affluent and pay their bills on time."
Ctit Group,Debt Trading Drives Morgan Stanley Net," Apr 20, 2017",1,"Morgan Stanley rode a boost in debt trading to surpass rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and join other big Wall Street firms in posting strong results to start the year.

The firm reported a first-quarter profit of $1.93 billion, or $1 a share, on revenue of $9.75 billion, all above analyst estimates. The results were also well ahead of the prior year's quarter, which was a time of tumult for all Wall Street firms.

Morgan Stanley's shares rose 2%, to $42.04 on Wednesday.

The biggest surprise was $1.71 billion in revenue from Morgan Stanley's fixed-income desk, which trades corporate and government bonds, currencies and commodities. For years the runt of the Wall Street litter, the business is showing steady progress after a leadership change and layoffs last year.

The unit has strung together four quarters of $1 billion-plus revenue, a goal cautiously laid out 10 months ago by Chief Executive James Gorman. This quarter, the fixed-income desk added another feather to its cap: besting Goldman Sachs, which reported $1.69 billion in fixed-income trading revenue.

Morgan Stanley has topped Goldman Sachs in that business just one other time since the financial crisis, during a tumultuous stretch in the summer of 2011, when skittish Goldman executives pulled back on trading.

The rivalry between the two firms is decades old and has persisted even as their business models have diverged, with Morgan Stanley diving headlong into its retail brokerage while Goldman stuck to its banking and trading guns. Morgan Stanley's success on the fixed-income front only underscored the severity of Goldman's first-quarter stumble. On Tuesday, that firm's first-quarter report shocked investors with a year-to-year decline in overall trading revenue, while fixed-income revenue was flat with the prior year.

Other banks with big trading arms such as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. had posted double-digit percentage gains in these areas.

Morgan Stanley's trading gains also raised more questions for investors about what might have gone wrong at Goldman. While that firm cited slow trading in commodities and corporate credit, Morgan Stanley finance chief Jonathan Pruzan said corporate bonds, interest-rate products and commodities saw strong demand.

With its latest results, Morgan Stanley hit several targets Mr. Gorman had set publicly. Its return on equity, a closely watched measure of profitability, was 10.7%, finally beating a 10% goal. It would have been 10% without the benefit of an accounting change that lowered its tax payments in the quarter, a spokesman said.

The firm's giant wealth-management business posted a 24% profit margin, a record and safely inside the raised bar set by Mr. Gorman two years ago.

The margin, though, still trailed the 27% posted for the first quarter by its main rival, Bank of America's Merrill Lynch unit.

One factor helping Morgan Stanley was a spike in interest income. This was the fruit of a push across the brokerage business to lend more.

Loans in the division rose 20% to $70 billion. Mr. Pruzan said growth was split across the bank's three main products: mortgages; loans backed by securities portfolios; and tailored loans secured by art, business interests and other valuables.

""In these types of markets, our business performs well,"" Mr. Pruzan said in an interview. ""We clearly have to prove it the rest of the year.""

Meanwhile, the firm kept a lid on costs. Excluding compensation, which rises in lockstep with revenue, expenses rose $100 million while revenue increased $2 billion.

""Solid as a rock,"" Steven Chubak, an analyst with Instinet, wrote in a note to clients.

One area of weakness occurred in the firm's strongest franchise, stock trading. Revenue in this area fell 1.9% to $2.02 billion from a year earlier. That business has grappled with lower commissions and more money moving to passive managers that trade less often."
Ctit Group,Goldman Posts Rare Trip-Up In Trading," Apr 19, 2017",1,"A rare trading stumble from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ended a streak of strong earnings for big U.S. banks and set the Wall Street powerhouse, fresh off a leadership transition, on its heels early in the year.

Goldman reported first-quarter net income of $2.26 billion, or $5.15 a share, on revenue of $8.03 billion. All three figures were better than a year earlier but fell below what Wall Street analysts had forecast.

The reason: a 2.4% decline from a year earlier in all-important trading revenue, which was well behind results reported by rivals.

The lackluster result shows that for all of its postcrisis changes -- dialing down risk, adding consumer-facing businesses and embracing lending -- the unpredictable and unforgiving business of swapping stocks, bonds and commodities remains critical to Goldman's fortunes.

Of course, one quarter of weakness is far from a trend, and investors still view Goldman as having one of the strongest trading franchises on Wall Street. The firm had a dismal first quarter in 2016 as well, only for results to bounce back later in the year.

But the rare misstep comes amid a transition atop the firm. Gary Cohn, the former No. 2 to Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, departed for a job in the White House in December and was succeeded by a new pair of top lieutenants.

R. Martin Chavez, who takes over as chief financial officer later this month, spent his first analyst earnings call explaining the misstep. ""We didn't navigate the market well,"" Mr. Chavez said. ""There are always things we can do better . . . but no one quarter defines the franchise.""

Goldman shares fell 4.7% Tuesday. The biggest contributor to the Dow Jones Industrial Average's postelection run, Goldman shares have been the index's biggest laggard this year as investors' skepticism about enactment of the Trump administration's agenda has increased.

Goldman's results contrast with those of big-bank rivals. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. beat estimates last week, powered by huge trading gains, and Bank of America Corp. followed suit Tuesday. Morgan Stanley is scheduled to report Wednesday.

Goldman's return on equity, a closely watched measure of profitability, was 11.4% in the first quarter, though it would have been 8.9% without a tax adjustment. That is below the bank's theoretical cost of capital of around 10%, a threshold Goldman rarely falls below.

Investors expected a better performance, in part because the Federal Reserve in recent months has twice raised interest rates. That bodes well for trading businesses as investors buy products to protect themselves from future increases and bet on interest rates moving in different directions.

But Goldman didn't get the boost seen elsewhere. Its fixed-income revenue was essentially flat compared with a year earlier, while J.P. Morgan posted a 17% gain, Citigroup was up 19% and Bank of America led with a 29% increase.

Mr. Chavez blamed calm markets, which present clients with fewer opportunities to make wagers on price moves. For example, the price of U.S. crude oil hasn't been this stable in more than two years, by one measure. That stings Goldman, which is bigger in commodities trading than rivals.

In other areas, Goldman tripped while rivals shone. Bank of America singled out corporate-bond trading as a bright spot, while Goldman said that dragged on its results. The Charlotte, N.C.-based bank also generated $1 billion more in overall fixed-income trading revenue than Goldman, the largest-ever gap between the two firms.

""Hard to put lipstick on these results,"" UBS Group AG analysts wrote in a note to clients. Goldman's trading desk hasn't been Wall Street's biggest by revenue in years, eclipsed by J.P. Morgan and others. But it has long been seen as its fiercest and most profitable, relying on its brains rather than size.

Making matters worse, the first quarter is typically the strongest for trading desks as investors reposition portfolios for the new year. The slow start is also likely to raise questions about whether the firm has the right mix of trading clients.

Goldman's traditional strength in peddling complex trading products to hedge funds, a high-margin business, once powered its results. But that focus became a liability in recent years as these clients struggled with poor returns and investor preference shifted to simpler widgets that, for example, protect against currency or interest-rate swings.

Goldman has pushed over the past year or so to emphasize those plain-vanilla products and do more trading business with corporations and asset managers. Mr. Chavez said Tuesday that the firm's efforts in that area were still under way.

The bank also shuffled leadership in its fixed-income trading business last fall and has been heavily courting quantitative funds. These use algorithms, rather than human hands, to trade heavy volumes of securities."
Ctit Group,Goldman's Traders Strike Out," Apr 19, 2017",0,"Goldman Sachs Group's strengths became weaknesses in the first quarter as its dominance in commodities trading and deal making worked against it.

Investors shouldn't be overly concerned at quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in what remains an exceptionally strong investment-banking franchise. But the bank does risk losing its halo among shareholders as a consistent outperformer.

Net profit in the first quarter was $2.26 billion, nearly doubling from an especially weak year-earlier period. But earnings per share and revenue both came in substantially below analyst expectations, and shares fell 4.7% Tuesday.

Revenue from M&A advisory, in which Goldman holds top global market share, fell by 2% from a year earlier. That isn't shocking given similarly tepid results from peers, but it weighed more significantly on Goldman given the importance of this business to the bank.

More worryingly, Goldman said the backlog of investment-banking business decreased from the end of last year. This suggests that political uncertainty may be holding back activity.

Goldman underperformed most significantly in trading. Fixed income, currencies and commodities trading revenue rose 1% from a year earlier. That compared with rises ranging from 17% to 29% at J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America.

In a conference call, Goldman's new chief financial officer, Martin Chavez, said oil-market volatility fell to its lowest level in around two years. But he also acknowledged that poor execution played a role.

Overall, Goldman Sachs posted a respectable 11.4% return on equity, but this was boosted by an accounting change in the treatment of taxation on share-based awards. On a like-for-like basis, return on equity came to 8.9%, down from 9.4% for all of 2016.

Stepped-up capital returns could help bring ROE back over 10%, and Goldman took a step in this direction by raising its quarterly dividend. But expenses are also worth a harder look. Last year the ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues actually rose.

If weak results continue at Goldman, the next thing to decline will be the bankers' cherished compensation."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp; Finance: M&amp;T Bank Results Top Estimates," Apr 18, 2017",1,"M&T Bank Corp. led financial shares higher after reporting earnings that beat expectations, helped by the recent uptick in interest rates.

The Buffalo, N.Y., bank also reported increased lending from a year ago, though its chief financial officer cautioned against assuming that loan demand would continue at the same speed.

""Loan growth, despite the optimism for change and a more business-friendly administration, has yet to materialize in a meaningful way,"" Chief Financial Officer Darren King said in a call with analysts on Monday.

Still, the bank's shares rose 3.9%, well ahead of the 1.9% gain in the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index.

Donald Trump's surprise win in the presidential election in November sent bank stocks higher. But analysts and investors have wondered whether the stock market gains will translate into loan demand.

At M&T, run by Chairman and CEO Robert Wilmers, both commercial and consumer lending were up from the first quarter in 2016.

Mr. King said there is ""still reason for optimism,"" but he added that the bank's outlook for 2017 loan growth is ""a little lower than it was in January.""

The regional bank's results were similar to those of PNC Financial Services Group Inc., which reported earnings last week that beat expectations. PNC and M&T are among the first regional lenders to disclose first-quarter earnings, setting the tone for the rest of the banks. Regions Financial Corp. is slated to report Tuesday.

At larger banks that have reported earnings, including Wells Fargo & Co. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the lending picture has been more mixed, though trading helped the bottom line at both J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc.

M&T posted earnings per share of $2.12, above the $1.93 analysts expected. Net interest margin, a key measure of lending profitability, and net interest income both rose, in part due to a rise in short-term interest rates.

Net interest margin rose to 3.34% from 3.18% a year earlier and from 3.08% in the December quarter. This drove an increase of taxable equivalent net interest income to $922 million from $878 million a year earlier.

The Federal Reserve raised its target short-term rate in both December and March, welcome news to banks that have been crimped from charging higher rates on loans. Still, Mr. King noted that higher rates have at least one disadvantage for banks: They challenge mortgage banking, where consumers are influenced to buy when rates are low. Consumer real-estate loans were down."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp; Finance: Chain Taps Tech Executive From Goldman," Apr 18, 2017",0,"Chain Inc. has hired a senior technology executive from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Tom Jessop, to boost its efforts deploying the technology behind bitcoin.

Mr. Jessop, who spent about 17 years at Goldman Sachs, most recently led global technology business development at the Wall Street firm. At Chain, which started in 2014 and is based in San Francisco, he will be president, working closely with Chief Executive Adam Ludwin, the company said Monday.

Mr. Jessop is the latest in a steady stream of bankers with a technology bent leaving to work at financial-technology startups, particularly those focused on blockchain, a broader term for the type of peer-to-peer network that was first used by digital currency bitcoin.

Early on, some fintech startups dreamed of disrupting Wall Street and displacing traditional banks. But many startups now say it will be more effective, and lucrative, to join with the incumbents. Mr. Jessop, who aims to open a New York office for the firm, is expected to work on such partnerships.

""On Wall Street, there's a lot of good work happening, but it's going to take a long time for things to evolve,"" he said. ""You are dealing with a regulatory regime and legacy technology.""

Among the projects Mr. Jessop worked on at Goldman Sachs, as a top executive in its principal investments team, were electronic trading venues such as Direct Edge and Japannext.

Chain makes money licensing a more secure and robust version of its open-source blockchain networking platform.

Last year it said it was working with Visa Inc. on a new system for business-to-business payments.

In 2015, Chain raised $30 million in a round from Visa, Capital One Financial Corp., Nasdaq Inc., the Citi Ventures unit of Citigroup Inc., and others.

It also has venture-capital backers including Khosla Ventures and Thrive Capital.

Ctit Group,"Neiman Marcus Finds Wealthy Want Deals --- High-end retailers, after years of raising prices, are now facing troubles of mass-market chains"," Apr 17, 2017",0,"Lysa Heslov used to be a loyal Neiman Marcus shopper. Now, she buys most of her clothes, shoes and handbags at websites that carry the same designer brands, often at cheaper prices.

""I price compare now much more than I ever did before,"" said Ms. Heslov, a 52-year-old documentary film director who lives in Los Angeles.

Neiman Marcus and other luxury retailers were long thought immune to the troubles of mass-market chains -- falling foot traffic and the constant price wars that have triggered widespread closure of brick-and-mortar stores.

But high-end chains, which raised prices incessantly over the past decade, are learning the hard way that even wealthy customers are hunting for better deals and selection, whether online or at shops run by individual brands.

""Even a very rich person can say, 'Enough is enough,' when it comes to price,"" said Matthew Singer, Neiman's former men's fashion director, now with his own clothing line.

Sales of personal luxury goods, such as designer apparel and handbags, fell 1% last year, the first decline since 2009, according to Bain & Co. The slowdown contrasts with 4% growth in the global luxury market, which reached $1.16 trillion when including expenditures on pricey cars, travel, restaurants and such.

""In the past, women had loyalty to a particular department store, and they would come in with a page torn from the retailer's catalog and say, 'I want that look,' "" said Robert Burke, the former fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman who now runs his own consulting firm.

The shift in consumer tastes has put pressure on several storied brands, including Tiffany & Co. and Ralph Lauren Corp., which both recently ousted their chief executives.

""Consumers no longer prefer a one-stop approach to shopping,"" said Deborah Weinswig of Fung Global Retail & Technology, a think tank. ""This coincides with the current sentiment that big is the opposite of cool, making it very difficult for major retailers and brands to maintain a high level of cachet.""

Few are feeling the heat as much as Neiman Marcus Group Ltd., which holds nearly $5 billion in debt that has grown through more than a decade of private-equity ownership. The company, which lost $406 million on sales of nearly $5 billion in the year that ended in July, recently abandoned plans to go public; credit-rating firms have warned there is a high risk it will default on its obligations.

With their equity practically wiped out, Neiman's owners, Ares Management LP and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, are looking for an exit. They recently approached Saks Fifth Avenue parent Hudson's Bay Co., about buying the retailer, according to people familiar with the situation. The continuing talks, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, are aimed at combining Neiman with its chief rival to cut costs and boost clout with suppliers.

The company is ""well-positioned to deal with both the secular and cyclical changes taking place in the luxury market,"" said Neiman board member and Ares co-founder David Kaplan. ""The brand remains a preferred destination for customers who value the expertise of the store associates and a differentiated product offering as well as for the design community.""

Once upon a time, all Neiman needed to do to lift profits was raise prices. That model has since fallen out of fashion.

Neiman Marcus opened its first store 110 years ago in Dallas, catering to those who made their wealth in Texas oil. One tycoon asked for all the items in a store window display delivered to his home for Christmas morning. Stanley Marcus, chief executive from 1950 to 1972, made it happen.

The company, which now includes two Bergdorf Goodman stores in Manhattan, opened outposts in Beverly Hills, Palm Beach, Fla., and other high-net ZIP Codes amenable to $5,000 gowns and $2,500 handbags. Its annual Christmas catalog displayed such gifts as a $1.5 million Valkyrie-X private plane. That kind of extravagance earned it the nickname Needless Markup.

""Our mantra had always been, 'There is nothing too expensive for our customer,' "" one former executive said.

Burt Tansky, chief executive for nine years until 2010, was fond of saying, ""I'd rather have one customer spending $5 million, than five million customers spending $1,"" other executives said. Mr. Tansky declined to comment.

The strategy allowed Neiman to increase average prices 7% to 9% annually until 2015, executives said. Some didn't believe it was sustainable. ""Every time Burt would say that I would cringe,"" said Steven Dennis, who was Neiman's senior vice president of strategy and marketing from 2004 to 2008.

Price-hike profits, though, were common among Neiman's peers. A 2015 Bain study found the entire luxury industry benefited from ""relentless price increases over the past five to 10 years.""

Consumers had little choice but to pay up because high-end brands tightly controlled distribution of their goods, usually keeping supplies limited to avoid end-of-season markdowns. And, until recently, few luxury goods were sold online, which gave brands a tighter rein on prices.

""One of the tricks to luxury is price discipline,"" said Aaron Cheris, the head of Bain's retail practice for the Americas. Shoppers pay full price, he said, when they can't ""get stuff for less.""

But competition from startups like Farfetch.com and Matchesfashion.com are forcing more discounts. Over a recent 24 hours, Farfetch's prices averaged 2% lower and Matchesfashion's 15% lower than Neimanmarcus.com's prices on 32 identical items, according to price-tracking firm Market Track LLC.

A Neiman spokeswoman said the comparison didn't take into account a promotion at the time that offered a gift card worth 25% off a purchase.

While brands still exert control, particularly over the newest and most popular items, it is harder for them to police prices that change rapidly across websites and fluctuate with shifting exchange rates, industry executives said.

The explosion of discount chains, led by T.J. Maxx, that sell designer brands at cut-rate prices also made consumers rethink the need to pay full price. To compete, high-end department stores rushed in with their own off-price chains -- Neiman's Last Call, Saks Off 5th and Nordstrom Rack.

Market forces have ""started to commoditize products that were once extremely exclusive,"" said Jenna Giannelli, a Citigroup Inc. analyst. About 37% of luxury goods sold at less than full price last year, Bain estimated, up from 32% two years ago.

Anais Assoun, a faithful Neiman customer, said she was never a sale shopper: ""If I wanted something, I would buy it at full retail."" These days, the Dallas resident shops sales, she said, because ""regular retail doesn't feel like a good value. You can easily spend $2,000 on shoes, which not that long ago would have been insane.""

Neiman's Chief Executive Karen Katz has tried to make her stores more accessible to younger, less affluent consumers. ""You have to constantly be looking for the next generation,"" she said.

Ms. Katz championed a line of specialty stores called Cusp, which Neiman opened a decade ago, that feature lower-priced clothing and accessories. Neiman stores also have added relatively less expensive goods, such as $700 Prada handbags, about a quarter the price of the brand's high-end satchels. In November, Neiman struck a deal with Rent the Runway, a startup that will rent expensive apparel at shops located in Neiman stores this year.

A year after becoming chief executive in 2010, Ms. Katz reduced snob appeal by allowing Neiman shoppers to use Visa and Mastercard. Previously, the stores only accepted American Express or Neiman credit cards.

Neiman has invested heavily in e-commerce, drawing roughly 31% of its sales from digital operations. That compares with an 8% online penetration for the luxury-goods market, according to Bain.

Not all the moves have worked. After building six Cusp stores, Neiman closed two and stopped development of the chain in 2012. ""As we came through the recession, we had to re-prioritize,"" Ms. Katz said. The experiment continues at Neiman stores, where departments that carry lower-priced items are called Cusp.

Neiman has suffered from the fall in energy prices that has sapped demand among wealthy Texan shoppers. And like other luxury retailers, it is grappling with a strong dollar that has chased off some foreign tourists.

The retailer appears to be drawing more youthful shoppers, with a bit more than half of its customers age 50 or younger as of last July, compared with slightly less than half a year earlier, according to securities filings.

Ms. Katz recently told analysts that Neiman is simply replacing aging baby boomers with ""the next generation.""

While younger shoppers are important to help brands stay relevant, they aren't buying luxury goods the way they once did.

""Back in 2007, there were young women who would skip meals to save money to buy the latest Marc Jacobs bag,"" said Michael Crotty, a marketing executive who has worked at Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus. ""Having the right bag, the right shoe, meant so much.""

To celebrate her 29th birthday last month, Veronica Kamenjarin, a Chicago attorney, splurged on a wine-tasting trip to Napa Valley, where she and her husband dined at the exclusive French Laundry. The last time she bought a designer handbag was four years ago.

Ms. Kamenjarin said she chose a classic Louis Vuitton style that wouldn't go out of fashion: ""I didn't want to worry about having to buy the latest bag every year.""

Neiman has less of a cushion than rivals because of its debt, which dates to its 2005 sale to Warburg Pincus LLC and TPG for about $5.1 billion.

To boost returns, Warburg and TPG paid mostly with borrowed money. The owners, along with bankers at Credit Suisse Group AG, came up with a new type of debt -- called pay-in-kind, or PIK, toggle bonds -- to protect against a downturn. These instruments allow the issuer to make interest payments by issuing new bonds rather than paying in cash.

Investors were drawn by a better yield, and PIK toggle bonds became a feature of many of the era's corporate buyouts. To celebrate their Neiman purchase, the buyout firms hung plaques fitted with replicas of old-fashioned factory switches.

When the financial crisis hit in 2008, and sales fell, Neiman's owners didn't want to spook suppliers by drawing on a credit line to make interest payments, said people familiar with the matter. Instead, they issued new debt to cover payments for nine months through October 2009.

In Warburg's New York offices, employees flipped the wall-mounted switches from ""cash"" to ""bonds,"" some of these people said.

When Neiman resumed cash payments in mid-2010, Warburg employees celebrated by switching the toggle back, they said.

By then, Neiman was generating enough cash to pay down debt, and the owners plotted their exit. They took nearly $450 million out of the company as a dividend a year before selling it for about $6 billion in 2013 to Ares and the CPPIB. The sellers more than doubled their cash investment in the deal. The new owners, meanwhile, loaded Neiman with more debt. By 2014, Neiman owed $4.7 billion, up from $250 million in 2005.

Ms. Katz got this advice after the 2013 deal by one of the sellers: Pursue a public stock offering as soon as possible and use the proceeds to pay down debt, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The owners have largely eschewed debt reduction, instead spending more than $900 million to refurbish stores, open new ones and beef up Neiman's online business, according to securities filings and a person familiar with the matter. The company had about $4.6 billion of debt as of January.

Neiman filed for an IPO in 2015, but withdrew the offering earlier this year as its business faltered. With Neiman's bonds trading at around 60 centson the dollar, the company could have trouble accessing the capital markets to refinance notes coming due in 2020 and 2021, according to Ms. Giannelli, the Citi analyst, with investors skeptical it can repay the debt.

On Friday, Neiman's owners once again chose to issue new debt to cover interest payments through October 14, according to a securities filing.

New management and cost cuts follow many corporate buyouts. But Neiman's owners have left Ms. Katz and her team alone. ""Each of them has allowed us to do what we've needed to do to grow the business,"" she said.

Yet, it is hard to ignore the rationale for combining Neiman and Saks, said Stephen Sadove, former Saks chief executive. ""It's a tougher luxury environment,"" he said, ""and you need more scale."""
Ctit Group,Markets &amp; Finance: Wall Street Critic Takes Aim at Commodities," Apr 17, 2017",1,"Campbell Harvey looks at Wall Street and sees a lot of ideas that are easy to sell but hard to trust.

The Duke University finance professor is making a career out of challenging research backing the products firms pitch to investors. Much of it, he says, just isn't sound.

His studies have shown that more than half of all research pumped out by both academics and analysts is, in his words, ""likely false."" Mine enough data, and you can find a result that backs up your idea, Mr. Harvey says.

While his contrarian ideas have put him at odds with many on Wall Street, Mr. Harvey's work has shown up in research and strategies employed by Goldman Sachs Group, GMO LLC's Jeremy Grantham and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, among others.

His next project is aimed at one of his favorite targets: commodities. When a famous academic paper helped bring the asset class into the mainstream in the early 2000s, Mr. Harvey warned that commodities were too opaque and volatile to hold for the long term, and were unlikely to provide the stocklike returns that some consultants suggested. Prices for oil, metals and other raw materials crashed twice in the following decade, vindicating his position.

With the asset class coming back into vogue, Mr. Harvey is preparing a paper challenging popular strategies in commodities investing.

""People still believe they should be buying commodity futures,"" Mr. Harvey said. ""I feel the obligation to correct that misperception.""

He may have some persuading to do. With signs of global economic growth picking up, commodities have bounced back after bottoming in early 2016. The S&P GSCI Index, which tracks commodity futures, rose 28% last year. That was the index's biggest gain since 2009, though its rally has stalled a bit this year with stagnant oil prices.

The recent rally has reignited investor interest in materials and resources. Commodity assets under management are up 41% from a year ago, rising to $408 billion as of the end of February, according to Citigroup Inc.

""Commodities, over long cycles, have provided diversification that reduces volatility,"" said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab Investment Management.

Mr. Harvey's interest in commodities was piqued by a 2004 paper from Yale University professors Gary Gorton and K. Geert Rouwenhorst.

Their research analyzed a commodity-futures portfolio from 1959 to 2004. They argued that a broad index of commodity futures offered annual returns on par with the S&P 500, but with the added benefit that their prices didn't move together with stocks and bonds.

Messrs. Gorton and Rouwenhorst worked with American International Group Inc., they noted in the paper. The insurer had developed the Dow Jones AIG Commodity Index about six years before and then used the research by Messrs. Gorton and Rouwenhorst to sell investment products tied to that index, according to people familiar with the process. An AIG spokeswoman declined to comment for this article. Messrs. Gorton and Rouwenhorst declined to comment. In their 2015 follow-up paper, they said their earlier findings on commodities ""largely hold up.""

Many consultants seized on their research to market commodities products to large investors. Giant pension funds like the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the Illinois Teachers' Retirement System began allocating money to commodities for the first time.

""When we read that paper, we just shook our heads,"" Mr. Harvey said, referring to himself and co-author Claude Erb, at the time a portfolio manager at Trust Company of the West. ""The narrative was problematic.""

Mr. Harvey stress-tested some of the other paper's main claims. For example, he said that replicating as diverse a commodities portfolio as Messrs. Gorton and Rouwenhorst recommended would prove challenging in the real world since many commodities, such as tin or butter, are thinly traded.

""This is much more complicated than buying a stock or bond,"" Mr. Harvey said. ""The sector is fraught with risk for retail investors, and it is discouraging that so many institutions get it wrong as well."""
Ctit Group,Banks' Pain Is Spread Unevenly," Apr 14, 2017",1,"The split between solid performance on Wall Street and a slowdown in lending growth is turning some banks into winners and others into laggards.

First-quarter net income rose by 17% from a year earlier at both J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup, beating analyst estimates in both cases, thanks to strong investment banking and trading activity. Wells Fargo saw flat net profit as loan growth slowed and expenses swelled in the aftermath of its sales-practice scandal.

The banks gave more details around a sudden slowdown in loan growth that has been showing up in Federal Reserve data and has caused concern and confusion among economists.

At J.P. Morgan, total loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter rose 6% from a year earlier, a slight deceleration from 7% growth at the end of last year. In the first quarter of 2016, J.P. Morgan's overall loan growth was a much stronger 11%.

The company also said that average commercial and industrial loans in the quarter increased 8% from a year earlier, though Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said this still represents a deceleration.

At Citigroup, loans grew by 8% from a year earlier in its global consumer operations and by 3% at its corporate bank.

One explanation for weakening loan growth could be that companies are raising money in capital markets instead of borrowing from banks. Ms. Lake said capital markets were ""wide open."" She also said there were fewer big, debt-financed M&A deals in the first quarter, which could have contributed some ""noise"" to the Fed's data.

J.P. Morgan Chief Executive James Dimon cited other factors as well for the slowdown, including higher mortgage rates and slowing auto sales. But he told analysts not to overreact and expressed confidence in the overall economic picture in the U.S.

Wells Fargo, which acts more like a regional bank because it lacks a big investment-banking operation, said the slowdown is an industry trend. The bank said growth of average quarterly loans slowed to 4% in the first quarter from 6% in the fourth quarter. The company cited a number of factors, including declining mortgages and the bank's own tightening of standards in auto loans. Costs are still rising as the company tries to dig its way out of the sales-scandal mess.

Citigroup and J.P. Morgan both got big boosts from equity and debt underwriting. Wells Fargo was the loser of the day, and it is also the most expensive of the three, trading at 1.5 times book value. The outlook for banking shares overall remains positive, but there is no compelling reason to hold this one."
Ctit Group,Banks' Rate Boon Stays Out of Reach for Now," Apr 14, 2017",1,"Some of the nation's largest banks warned Thursday that the benefits investors anticipated from rising interest rates and the election of Donald Trump as president aren't panning out quite as quickly as many had hoped.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. posted sharp increases in first-quarter profit, fueled by a continued rebound in their Wall Street trading businesses. But the results, along with those from Wells Fargo & Co., highlighted that the rising interest rates, more robust loan demand and pro-growth policies that many bank investors were betting on after Mr. Trump's election had so far failed to yield breakout gains.

Shares at all three banks fell more than the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which dropped 0.7%. Wells Fargo fell 3.3%, while J.P. Morgan lost 1.2%.

Since the election, the S&P financial sector was up more than 16% heading into Thursday's trading, and less than 1% since inauguration.

While bank stocks surged in the wake of Mr. Trump's surprise victory, they have slipped the past month as investors grow more doubtful about whether broad measures like lending growth and profitability will catch up with loftier valuations.

Bank executives told investors on a series of conference calls that they were sanguine that U.S. policy makers' goals of loosening financial regulations and cutting tax rates would eventually help boost growth.

""When you have a new president and they get going . . . it's going to be a sausage-making period,"" J.P. Morgan Chief Executive James Dimon said on a conference call with analysts. To expect it to be smooth, ""that would just be silly.""

Investors are feeling less patient. ""There are itchy trigger fingers"" from investors looking to sell, said Christopher Davis, a veteran portfolio manager at Davis Funds, which manages about $25 billion in assets and recently reported owning large stakes of J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo.

While he likes the steady and consistent growth both companies are likely to offer in coming years, he says that many investors in recent weeks have grown more worried about banks' lending potential.

At both J.P. Morgan and Citigroup, profit rose 17% in the first quarter, with the capital-markets arms of each bank being the brightest spots of their reports. Wells Fargo, which has a relatively slimmer footprint on Wall Street businesses, said its first-quarter profit was flat.

Commercial loan balances didn't change at J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. New auto loans declined 17% at J.P. Morgan and 29% at Wells Fargo compared with last year's first quarter. John Shrewsberry, Wells Fargo's finance chief, said that signs of rising delinquencies and deteriorating used-car values are causing the bank to be more cautious.

In Citigroup's North American consumer-banking group, profit fell 25%, driven by credit losses on some credit cards. At J.P. Morgan's and Wells Fargo's consumer-banking arms, profit fell 20% and 9%, respectively.

PNC Financial Services Group Inc. bucked some of the trends, saying stronger loan activity helped its earnings beat expectations Thursday. The Pittsburgh bank attributed the growth in part to markets where it is expanding, including Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis.

In coming quarters, big banks hope that interest rates continue climbing, since that would essentially give them more pricing power in lending products.

In March, the Federal Reserve moved its target short term rate higher, its third interest-rate bump in the past two years. Big banks earn more money by lending out their vast deposits when interest rates rise. They also benefit from a larger gap between short term and long term rates, a so-called steep yield curve.

J.P. Morgan said it expects net interest income to rise by about $4.5 billion in 2017. Citigroup said it was now building into future plans an additional rate increase, in June. That would help bump up its expected year-over-year core interest revenue by $1.5 billion over the next three quarters.

But the bank also made a ""modest reduction"" in expectations for loan growth. Rising rates have a downside in making some loans, especially mortgage refinancing, less attractive to borrowers.

Wall Street trading desks were a bright spot. J.P. Morgan's trading revenue increased 13% to $5.82 billion in the first quarter of 2017, while Citigroup's rose 17% to $4.39 billion. Last year's first quarter was a brutal one for each bank's trading arm, so the latest results are coming off of a low base.

Fixed-income trading revenue was up nearly 20% at each bank, reflecting higher activity in markets for government bonds and other securities closely tied to interest rates. Investment-banking fees at each bank were up nearly 40% thanks in part to underwriting more bond deals for companies looking to lock in low borrowing costs.

""There's good momentum, as we see things now,"" said Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat. ""Client engagement was high, and I think remains high into the second quarter.""

Meanwhile, Marianne Lake, J.P. Morgan's finance chief, said on a conference call that she expected the Trump administration's agenda would eventually lead to more hiring, spending and borrowing. But she acknowledged that much of the economic activity hadn't yet arrived. ""It's completely understandable that optimism would lead action."""

Ctit Group,Yields Fall on 'Show-Me' Sentiment," Apr 14, 2017",0,"Government-bond yields are falling, the latest sign investors are retreating from expectations that favorable government policies would deliver a welcome jolt to global growth, inflation and interest rates.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell Thursday to 2.237%, its lowest close since Nov. 16. That was down from 2.294% Wednesday and 2.609% on March 13. Yields fall as bond prices rise.

The decline is noteworthy because it takes the yield below the 2.3%-2.6% range that took hold soon after Donald Trump was elected president in November. U.S. markets are closed Friday for Good Friday.

Many investors entered 2017 expecting the yield would rise to around 3% by year-end, reflecting economic growth and the administration's presumed success in cutting taxes and reducing regulation. Rising interest rates on bonds often reflect faster growth as investors demand better returns to compensate for higher short-term interest rates set by the Federal Reserve and inflation.

Instead, yields are again falling from relatively low levels, raising fresh concerns about the health of the global economy years after the financial crisis and the present valuations of stocks, bonds and other assets.

""The Trump trade is fading as the complexities of implementing the Trump agenda have become gradually understood,"" said Christopher Sullivan, chief investment officer at United Nations Federal Credit Union.

The bond rally isn't the only market development reflecting a shift in investors' thinking. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 have pulled back after hitting records in early March. Bank shares, a big postelection winner, have lagged behind this year, with the sector falling again Thursday despite generally solid earnings from Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. Shares of utilities, the laggard late last year, have rallied in 2017. The Mexican peso has almost recouped all of the ground it lost against the dollar after the U.S. election. Gold has regained a large part of its postelection selloff and is up 12% this year.

The 10-year Treasury yield began to decline when Fed officials signaled after their March 14-15 policy meeting that they still expect to raise interest rates three times this year. That was a less aggressive message than many investors had expected and was followed by a setback for Mr. Trump when he failed to gather enough votes to pass a health-care bill.

Tighter monetary policy tends to raise interest rates on new bonds, diminishing the value of outstanding debt that pays less. Faster growth can lead to higher inflation, which eats away at the value of bonds' fixed payments over time.

Bonds got an extra boost this week from geopolitical developments, including rising tensions between the U.S. and Russia over the Syrian conflict and between the U.S. and North Korea amid efforts to thwart that country's nuclear development ambitions.

Investors have also become increasingly concerned about France's presidential election, where two of the four leading candidates are deeply skeptical of the European Union.

Then Mr. Trump on Wednesday said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that he favored a weaker dollar and low interest rates, pushing the 10-year yield as low as 2.218% in overnight trading.

Some analysts have long been skeptical that the U.S. economy can accelerate significantly regardless of policy, as it continues to face headwinds including an aging population and low productivity growth.

The GDPNow model from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta suggests the U.S. economy grew at a 0.6% rate in the first quarter.

That is hardly the big lift in growth that investors anticipated after Mr. Trump's victory. Still, other economic models are more optimistic and many investors aren't too concerned about the overall economy. Even if growth has been modest, the labor market has been steadily tightening, leading to slowly rising wages that help to firm inflation figures."

-- The expectation of loosening financial regulations has boosted J.P. Morgan's share price along with the sector since President Donald Trump was elected. But several figures who could affect bank regulation haven't been named and recent reports indicate Glass-Steagall could be back on the table, leading to possible bank breakups.

-- At the bank's recent investor-day presentation in mid-February, executives said core loans should increase about 10% from a year earlier, so investors will be listening for any talk of an uptick in loan demand.

CITIGROUP INC.

-- Fixed-income trading is one of Citigroup's biggest businesses, and business has improved of late: A strong 2016 ended with a 36% surge in the fourth quarter. Continuing the hot streak would make it four quarters of trading gains in a row. Equities may be a tougher slog. Citigroup's investments in that business may help at the margin, but low stock-market volatility presents a tough backdrop for progress there.

-- Citigroup has the most oversized capital cushion of any U.S. bank by many estimates, thanks in part to the capital it must hold against its large tax-loss assets. How quickly it uses those deferred taxes against profits will be closely watched, as that could herald bigger future buybacks and dividends.

-- Wells Fargo's board earlier this week released results of its monthslong independent investigation into the bank's sales practices. The group largely blamed former senior executives for the sales mess, including ex-Chief Executive John Stumpf, clawing back an additional $75 million in pay from two of them. Investors will be looking to see whether Wells Fargo now can turn from damage control back to growth.

Ctit Group,Equities -- Ahead of the Tape: Why Banks Stand to Regain Momentum," Apr 12, 2017",1,"The big postelection bank rally is over, but healthy first-quarter earnings and a good outlook for the rest of the year should give them another lift.

Bank stocks were among the biggest winners late last year, with the KBW Nasdaq Bank index soaring 22% from Nov. 8 to the end of 2016. But since then the bank index has underperformed.

Now, Wall Street will be watching closely as three of the biggest lenders in the U.S. -- J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo -- all report first-quarter earnings on Thursday.

Analysts expect Wells Fargo, which benefits less than the others from elevated market activity and is still contending with the aftermath of its account-sales fiasco, to post a 3% year-over-year decline in earnings per share, according to FactSet. J.P. Morgan and Citigroup are both expected to report 13% increases in first-quarter earnings per share.

This still represents a dialing down of expectations: As of the end of last year, analysts estimated first-quarter increases of 16% and 20%, respectively, for the two banks.

A few developments have contributed to this tempering of analyst views: Long-term interest rates, which shot up following the election, have since come down a bit as markets are less sure that growth and inflation will accelerate. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasurys has fallen to 2.30% from 2.48% at the end of 2016.

Loan growth has slowed significantly and mysteriously since November. Investors will be eager to hear what is causing this.

Finally, market trading activity, which rose strongly in the second half of last year, has been relatively subdued.

Still, these negatives are likely to be more than offset by several positive factors in the first quarter. For now, net interest margins are more sensitive to short-term than long-term rates, meaning banks will see real benefits from recent Federal Reserve tightening.

Wells Fargo is still expensive at 1.6 times book value. But J.P. Morgan Chase looks fairly valued at 1.3 times, and Citigroup remains downright cheap at just 0.8 times.

Bank shares have gotten off to a weak start this year. The rest of 2017 should give them a boost."
Ctit Group,Did Banks Get a 'Trump Bump' or Not? --- Results to be released are a moment of truth for expectations set by the new presidency," Apr 12, 2017",1,"Investors get a first look at bank earnings under President Donald Trump this week.

The biggest U.S. banks kick off the first-quarter earnings season Thursday morning with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co. and Citigroup Inc. each reporting results for the three months ended March 31.

Investors will seek to judge whether the outlook for the firms will live up to the sharp rise in bank stocks since the election, reflecting expectations that growth will pick up under Trump administration policies.

Most big banks are forecast to show higher profits compared with last year's dismal first quarter, when plunging oil prices, concerns about China's economy and tough trading conditions weighed on results.

But over the past 90 days, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters have revised their revenue estimates lower for three banks -- Citigroup, J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. -- and raised them a bit for Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo.

One reason for analysts' hesitancy is a surprising, sharp slowdown in business lending since late 2016. Commercial and industrial loans, which account for the bulk of many banks' loan portfolios, expanded by a 1% annual rate in January and shrank by a 1.3% annual rate in February, according to Federal Reserve data.

That is a steep decline from the pace of expansion over much of the past year."
Ctit Group,Banking &amp; Finance: Cybertheft Bid Echoes Earlier Heist," Apr 11, 2017",1,"Cyberthieves who attempted to steal $170 million from an Indian bank last July used methods that strongly resemble those of an earlier, successful $81 million heist targeting Bangladesh's central bank, according to people familiar with the matter.

The similarities between the Indian and Bangladeshi hacks underscore concerns about a rash of cyberattacks in recent months on financial institutions around the world, including banks in the U.S., Mexico, Poland and the U.K. Some of these hacks have been linked to groups affiliated with North Korea, cybersecurity specialists said this year.

State-owned Union Bank of India Ltd.'s computer system was infected with malware that allowed thieves to authorize the transfer of around $170 million from the bank's account in New York to private accounts in five locations, people familiar with the matter said. Fast detection by bankers allowed the Indian lender to prevent the money's release.

Investigators studying the Indian hack said similar tactics and coding were used by computer criminals who attempted to steal nearly $1 billion from Bangladesh's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in February of last year. Many orders had been filled with misspellings and formatting errors, and the Fed blocked some of the withdrawal -- but the thieves were able to move about $81 million to accounts in the Philippines.

U.S. prosecutors are building cases that would accuse North Korea of directing the Bangladeshi attack. North Korea's mission to the United Nations didn't respond to requests for comment.

This account of the Union Bank of India hack is based on interviews with Arun Tiwari, the bank's chairman, and several other people familiar with the incident.

The attack on Union Bank began in late July last year when an employee opened an attachment on an email that appeared to have come from India's central bank, Mr. Tiwari said. That action activated a piece of malware that allowed the hackers to steal Union Bank's access codes for the international messaging system banks use to authorize cross-border transactions, known as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift.

The hackers then used those codes to send authentic-looking instructions to a Union Bank account at Citigroup Inc. in New York, which handles processing of wire transfers and clears dollar transactions. The instructions ordered around $170 million to be sent to accounts in Thailand, Cambodia, Australia, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

The money went to several shell companies associated with Asian -- in particular Chinese -- organized crime syndicates, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The cybercriminals behind the Bangladesh heist similarly stole bank codes to place fake transfer orders. Swift in November said banks using its network had sustained fresh attacks from hackers since the Bangladesh heist. Swift declined to comment on whether Union Bank of India was one of those banks, although Mr. Tiwari said Swift officials have been working with Union Bank since the day of the hack.

Swift generally creates two reports per transaction: one sent to the originating bank, in this case, Union Bank, and another to the correspondent bank handling the overseas transactions, which was Citigroup. The correspondent bank then forwards its report to the originating bank the next day, so it can cross-check the transactions.

On July 21, an employee in Union Bank's treasury department who was comparing the reports found that Citigroup had executed six transactions that Union Bank hadn't intended to authorize. He notified senior executives of the mismatch, and the bank immediately began trying to get the money back.

""This [office] was a war room that day,"" Mr. Tiwari said.

Union Bank recovered the money sent to Thailand, Cambodia, and Australia -- more than half of the total -- within 24 hours. It got a court order in Hong Kong to retrieve the rest of the funds, and had gotten all of its money back by July 24."
Ctit Group,Banks Clash With NYSE Over Data --- Rift over who owns lucrative information about trading activity divides Wall Street," Apr 7, 2017",0,"Some of Wall Street's biggest firms are balking at an attempt by the New York Stock Exchange to assert greater control over market data -- a behind-the-scenes spat that highlights the growing importance of Big Data in today's financial markets.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and electronic traders Virtu Financial Inc. and KCG Holdings Inc. are among the firms concerned about the exchange's move, people familiar with the situation said. Virtu confirmed its opposition to NYSE's move, while none of the others would speak on the record.

The dispute centers on a new contract, called the NYSE Master User Agreement, which the exchange operator is requiring firms to sign to keep trading on its markets.

At the heart of the dispute is legal language about who owns the data that brokers submit to the exchange when they buy and sell stocks. The contract implies that NYSE owns the data. Brokers and trading firms say the data are rightfully theirs.

Exchanges aggregate such data and sell it in the form of high-speed feeds -- often to the same firms whose trading activity generated the data in the first place. Such data feeds have become a growing source of revenue for exchanges in recent years, prompting complaints from Wall Street firms that they are being overcharged.

""This dispute demonstrates the fundamental point market participants have been making about the exchange's unchecked control over market data and its pricing,"" Virtu Chief Executive Doug Cifu said in an email.

""You'd be hard pressed to find another industry where a government-licensed entity can take your intellectual property and sell it back to you at an arbitrarily high markup,"" Mr. Cifu said.

The Master User Agreement, a seven-page document available on NYSE's website, differs from similar contracts from the Big Board's competitors, lawyers say.

""It appears that NYSE could be going further than other exchanges,"" said David Franasiak, a lawyer who reviewed the agreement for The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Franasiak is a principal at Williams & Jensen PLLC, a law and lobbying firm that has worked for brokerage firms, but he isn't involved in the dispute.

Dozens of other firms have already signed the agreement, a person close to NYSE said.

The clash began early this year when NYSE released an update to the contract, replacing a previous version that brokers had found acceptable and surprising them with the new language, according to one of the people familiar with the dispute.

Upset brokers reached out to one another and held conference calls, including as recently as March 30, people briefed on the discussions said. One person said NYSE was set to take part in the call last week but backed out. The person close to NYSE said the exchange has been engaged in dialogue with the firms.

Another call involved the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is monitoring the situation and remaining neutral, a person familiar with the matter said.

Controversy over the cost of market data has been brewing for years. Brokers complain that exchanges like NYSE, which was a nonprofit until 2006, have become more aggressive about raising data fees since they turned into for-profit corporations.

NYSE's owner, Intercontinental Exchange Inc., has beefed up its data business since completing its acquisition of the Big Board in 2013. Last year, 44% of ICE's net revenue came from market-data sales and related fees, up from 9% in 2011. Much of that increase is due to acquisitions of data companies, but some is attributable to price increases and new data products, according to the company's SEC filings.

ICE has said in the past that its data fees are reasonable, and exchanges reject claims that they are abusing their market power.

In many of the user agreements for U.S. exchanges, firms give up some rights to market data to be allowed to trade on the exchange. There is typically a provision in which users grant the exchange a license to take their raw trading data and resell it in the form of aggregated data products, provided that the identities of the people or firms behind the trades aren't revealed.

NYSE competitors Nasdaq Inc., Bats and IEX Group Inc. all have such clauses in their user agreements. They also contain boilerplate language stating that the user ""retains all ownership and other rights"" to the data they submit to the exchange.

But the NYSE Master User Agreement contains no such provision. Instead, it states that market data on the exchange is the property of NYSE.

It also lacks a licensing provision in which users grant the exchange the right to use their data -- even though past NYSE user agreements have contained such language."
Ctit Group,"Markets &amp; Finance: ECB Tapering Looms Over Bonds --- As central bank pares back its holdings, investors brace for corporate-debt selloff"," Apr 5, 2017",0,"High-grade corporate bonds surged when the European Central Bank added them to its 2.3 trillion euro ($2.45 trillion) purchase program last year. Now, with a slowdown in ECB buying on the horizon -- alongside potentially risky European elections -- some investors are bracing for a selloff.

The ECB started paring its monthly purchases of European debt from 80 billion euros to 60 billion euros in April, meaning it will buy around 1.9 billion euros fewer corporate bonds every month, assuming it keeps the allocation of its purchases steady.

Some analysts think there is more tapering to come from the ECB, potentially turning the largest source of demand for the European corporate-bond market over the past year into its greatest risk.

It feels like ""the quiet before the storm,"" said Hans Lorenzen, head of European investment-grade credit strategy at Citigroup, listing a string of potential risks, including Brexit negotiations and the threat of euroskeptic candidate Marine Le Pen winning the French presidency.

""But what really worries people is what happens when asset classes like credit no longer have the outright support of the ECB,"" he added.

The ECB has said it would continue buying bonds at its current pace until at least the end of 2017. Many economists expect a fledgling eurozone economic recovery will allow the ECB to signal this year it will further reduce its purchases from 2018 onward.

They include strategists at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., who wrote in a recent note that they expect the ECB to end its purchases by the middle of next year. That could prompt investors to pull out their money, the strategists said, pointing as evidence to the 15.2 billion euros of high-grade credit-fund outflows in the six months following the ""bund tantrum"" of 2015, when German yields jumped sharply on expectations of rebounding global inflation. Yields rise as prices fall.

As the dominant figure in European credit markets, the ECB had snapped up 75 billion euros of high-grade, euro-denominated nonfinancial debt as of March 31, having started buying these securities in June 2016. That compares with roughly 79 billion euros of net issuance of debt eligible for the ECB program since then, according to Citigroup.

That demand pushed up corporate-bond prices sharply and lowered company borrowing costs across the eurozone. The credit spread investors demand to hold investment-grade corporate bonds rather than government debt fell to a recent low of 1.1 percentage points in September from 1.7 percentage points before the ECB announced its buying plans in March 2016, according to IHS Markit's iBoxx Euro Non-Financials corporate bond index.

Some investors even began paying for the privilege of lending money to companies. German consumer-products company Henkel AG and French drugmaker Sanofi SA priced bonds at negative yields in September. U.S. firms -- most of which cannot issue bonds eligible for the ECB's program -- got in on the act this year, with Coca-Cola Co. and Pfizer Inc. recently selling floating-rate euro debt at negative yields.

Many investors believe valuations leave little room for bonds to gain further and plenty for prices to tumble.

""Even if you're super bullish on credit, there's not a lot further you can go,"" said Ben Bennett, head of credit strategy at Legal & General Investment Management. He said the fund's investment-grade portfolios were holding high proportions of cash and generally favored U.S. bonds.

Some believe corporate bonds have the most to lose of any asset class from an ECB withdrawal, given that is where the bank's stimulus packed its biggest punch. ""If we start to talk about tapering, the No. 1 impact should be on credit,"" said Olivier De Larouziere, head of rates at Natixis Asset Management.

Thin credit spreads afford investors little protection against a sudden jerk higher in bond yields. Jorgen Kjaersgaard, head of European credit at AllianceBernstein, said he is concerned about a replay of the ""taper tantrum"" in the U.S. -- a period when yields spiked after the Federal Reserve discussed scaling back its bond purchases in 2013."
Ctit Group,Quarterly Profits Seen Strongest Since 2011," Apr 5, 2017",1,"U.S. companies are poised to report their strongest quarterly earnings in years, another sign that the stock-market rally could have further to run.

Analysts expected earnings for S&P 500 companies to grow by 9.1% overall in the first quarter from a year earlier, as of March 31, which would mark the highest growth since the fourth quarter of 2011, according to FactSet. Still, analysts have trimmed their profit expectations since the start of the year, and disappointing results could stoke concerns that stock-price gains have outpaced earnings growth.

Reporting season heats up over the next few weeks, with banks including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. expected to report results next week and giants like Johnson & Johnson, Verizon Communications Inc. and General Electric Co. scheduled the week after.

Investors have been betting that U.S. corporate profits will soar this year, supercharged by a Trump agenda that includes tax cuts and looser regulations. Last month's collapse of the Republican health-care bill cast doubt on such policies, but a strong earnings season could give investors a reason to keep investing in stocks.

Technology companies, among the best performers in the stock market this year, are expected to post some of the biggest earnings gains. Meanwhile, profits at industrial companies are projected to contract, potentially weighing on a sector that has lagged behind the broader S&P 500 this year after outperforming in the postelection rally.

""The buying and closing your eyes bit -- that part's gone,"" said Bret Chesney, senior portfolio manager at Alpine Global Management LLC. ""I think now is when we really start to be dependent on what the hard numbers show.""

Apple Inc., whose stock is up 25% this year, was expected to report per-share earnings of $2.02 for its latest quarter as of March 31, up from $1.90 a share in the year-earlier period. Shares of the world's most valuable company hit a record this year partly on bets that its 10th-anniversary iPhone, expected later this year, will keep momentum building at the firm. The company posted a profit in January after three consecutive quarters of declines. Apple declined to comment.

Oil prices also have rebounded from their 2016 lows, a factor that should help energy companies -- the biggest laggards in previous earnings seasons -- improve results. Energy companies are expected to be the biggest contributors to earnings growth for the first quarter -- accounting for more than a third of the broader index's projected gains, according to FactSet.

Revenue also is expected to pick up for S&P 500 companies overall, after many had relied on cost-cutting to improve profits during the recovery from the financial crisis -- an encouraging sign for some investors who were looking for more sustainable growth. For the first quarter, S&P 500 firms are projected to report revenue growth of 7.1%, the biggest jump in more than five years, according to FactSet.

Improving corporate health and U.S. economic data have supported stocks since the second half of last year, helping the rally weather shifts in fiscal-policy expectations. Over the past year, S&P 500 companies have rebounded from a five-quarter earnings slump, wage growth has firmed and consumer confidence has risen to a more than 16-year-high.

A dollar rally, which some worried would cut into exporters' profits, has stalled this year after a postelection surge.

Analysts have pared back their expectations for first-quarter earnings since the start of the year, but the cuts have been smaller than the average over the past five years, according to FactSet. As of year-end, analysts estimated first-quarter earnings growth would be 12.5%.

But disappointing earnings could dent stocks' recent gains. Shares of industrial and materials companies, which helped lead the rally between Election Day and the end of 2016, posted the largest declines since then in expected earnings.

As of March 31, analysts expected General Electric to post first-quarter per-share earnings of 17 cents, down from the 21 cents it reported a year earlier, according to FactSet. Analysts had expected first-quarter earnings of 29 cents per share at the end of 2016. The company -- whose stock is down 5% this year after a 7.4% advance between Election Day and year-end -- has faced pressure from activist investors to slash expenses after missing profit targets last year, The Wall Street Journal has reported.

Mining firm Freeport-McMoRan Inc. was expected March 31 to post earnings of 18 cents a share for the first quarter, compared with a loss of 16 cents a year earlier but down from analysts' year-end estimate of 41 cents a share, according to FactSet. The company said in March that, because of a standoff with regulators, it had to scale back output and lay off workers in Indonesia, where it derives roughly a third of its copper output. Its stock is up 2.7% this year after rising 9.1% between Election Day and the end of 2016.

GE and Freeport declined to comment.

Still, company management has been upbeat. S&P 500 firms used the word ""optimistic"" in 52% of earnings calls for the fourth-quarter earnings season, the most ever in Bank of America Merrill Lynch data going back to 2003. At the same time, company-issued guidance was ""nothing to write home about,"" the firm noted.

The gap between firms' confidence and their future earnings estimates reflects a concern among some investors and analysts: That stocks have run up at a pace beyond what is warranted by earnings results.

Major indexes' gains since November have made them even more expensive relative to their historical valuations, raising some concerns that they could be vulnerable to a pullback."
Ctit Group,Markets &amp; Finance: Munis Attract Foreign Buyers," Apr 5, 2017",1,"America's asset managers are finding new ways to take advantage of the latest trend: the wave of foreign investors buying the debt of U.S. cities and states.

Overseas dollars have been flooding into the municipal market for several years, with foreign investment in munis doubling since 2009 to $106 billion of the $3.8 trillion market, according to Federal Reserve data. The trend picked up in the last quarter of 2016, with foreigners adding an unprecedented $21 billion in municipal bonds.

Foreign companies see no benefit from the tax-exemption that comes with most muni bonds, so they tend to gravitate to higher-yielding taxable bonds. But some foreign investors are also interested in tax-exempt bonds, testing an assumption of the muni market, that buyers typically are drawn in part by tax advantages.

Trying to meet the surge in demand, Nuveen Asset Management and a subsidiary of Citigroup Inc. will soon launch a mutual-fund type municipal-bond investment vehicle, managed by Nuveen, according to people familiar with the matter.

Other money-management firms are wooing banks and insurance companies in Taiwan, Korea and Japan by offering private municipal-bond funds. Another firm is selling shares in exchange-traded funds to Swiss and British investors.

""Munis are global now,"" said Rob Amodeo, head of municipals at Western Asset Management, a Pasadena, Calif.-based bond manager that is a subsidiary of Legg Mason.

Since November 2015, Western Asset has run a private fund that invests in muni debt on behalf of Japanese financial institutions in partnership with Japan's Shinsei Bank Ltd.

Standish Mellon Asset Management LLC, a unit of Bank of New York Mellon, recently won a commitment from a Korean insurance company to run a separately managed account filled entirely with municipal bonds, senior portfolio manager Jeffrey B. Burger said. The firm is in talks with other insurers in Korea, China and Japan as well as an investor in Australia, he said.

The typical overseas investors in muni debt are foreign life insurers in search of long-dated securities to match their long-term liabilities, bankers and asset managers said. Banks have also made up a substantial portion of the demand.

The trend means these overseas investors are often buying the debt of towns they couldn't find on a map. At Nuveen Asset Management, which already manages the muni-bond investments of some Asian and European institutions, ""We've brought an atlas into meetings before,"" said co-head of global fixed income John Miller.

These investors are tempted by the bonds' relative safety, longer duration and relative yield. Some also seek diversification. A strengthening dollar, expected if the Federal Reserve raises rates, could also help bolster the investments.

There are risks, given the bonds often won't mature for decades and rising long-term rates could reduce their value. Municipal bonds aren't as liquid as Treasurys. In addition, U.S. municipalities have, on rare occasions, defaulted."
Ctit Group,"Raw Materials, Sleek Tech"," Apr 5, 2017",1,"Banks and traders are experimenting with the technology behind bitcoin in an effort to solve longstanding problems in the trading of physical commodities.

Blockchain, the technology used to record ownership of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, has been making inroads recently in the financial world. Central banks and other institutions are exploring it for payments and data sharing. Big banks including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. have tested the technology in recording financial transactions.

Now commodities players are trying out blockchain to help buy and sell goods and raw materials.

French bank Natixis and commodity trading firm Trafigura Pte. Ltd. unveiled a platform in late March with International Business Machines Corp. to carry out U.S. crude-oil transactions electronically using blockchain technology.

A group of participants in the cotton market is also evaluating the use of blockchain in trading and plans to release its results in May. The consortium, which has collaborated with IBM to use its blockchain platform, includes big agricultural commodities traders Cargill Inc. and Louis Dreyfus Co.

The technology records each transaction in a ledger of which every computer has an identical copy. This makes counterfeiting virtually impossible because every transaction can be checked against the other records. It also obviates the need for costly and time-consuming back-office record-keeping by third parties like finance companies.

Firms are turning to blockchain because the exchange of physical goods is plagued by pitfalls that have existed for decades in these notoriously opaque markets.

Trades are routinely bogged down by paper documents that take time to verify and can be lost or forged during ownership changes. This can be costly for consumers and producers, especially when payments or deliveries are delayed or interrupted. It can also frustrate those unable to track where their materials come from.

By establishing a decentralized system, traders think they can cut down on time, expenses and opportunities for fraud. Blockchain can create digital codes for, say, each gold bar or bale of cotton, and records all points of sale on an encrypted list that is verified by multiple parties.

""I'm more and more convinced that this technology is going to be disruptive for the industry,"" said Patrick Arnaud, managing director of trade and commodity finance at ING Groep NV.

ING, Societe Generale SA and commodities-trading house Mercuria Investment Co. in February executed the first delivery of crude oil to run entirely on a blockchain platform. The trade tracked the transport of crude from Africa to China.

ING found that the use of blockchain, instead of paper certification, reduced its involvement in each transaction to about 25 minutes from an average of three hours. Blockchain also cut costs by about 30%, the bank said.

The banks are in discussions to conduct a similar trade in liquefied natural gas, according to Mr. Arnaud.

Despite the eagerness of some traders to adopt the technology, blockchain faces obstacles to its widespread use in commodities trading.

Regulatory requirements for exchanging goods are different from country to country and may need to change to become compatible with cross-border blockchain trades.

""It's going to brush up against an existing compliance regime as well as regulation or legislation in its own right,"" said Emma Weston, co-founder of AgriDigital, a commodity-management platform that has used blockchain to trade grain.

Another challenge is persuading an industry that has been resistant to change to embrace a new system, especially one that has had some miscues. While the underlying protocol for bitcoin has never been hacked, apps and services built on top of it have been plagued by privacy and intrusion scandals."
Ctit Group,Business News: Discount Carrier Frontier Taxis Toward IPO," Apr 1, 2017",1,"Frontier Group Holdings Inc. is planning an initial public offering that would make it the first U.S. airline to go public in three years.

The Denver-based airline filed regulatory documents on Friday flagging its intention to make a public market debut, without specifying the offering's timing or number of shares.

Frontier is one of three discounters -- alongside Spirit Airlines Inc. and Allegiant Travel Co.'s Allegiant Air -- that have roiled the U.S. airline industry with their rock-bottom fares. Larger carriers with higher costs have responded by introducing lower-fare categories with restrictions on ticket changes and other amenities. Even so, the industry has seen profits soar in recent years on a wave of mergers, moderate fuel prices and a strengthening economy.

Virgin America Inc. was the last U.S. carrier to go public, in 2014. Virgin America was acquired in December by Alaska Air Group Inc. Spirit went public in 2011.

Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Evercore Partners Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. are leading Frontier's proposed IPO, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company, which is the eight-largest U.S. airline by traffic, indicated a proposed maximum offering of $100 million, but only as an estimate for calculating a registration fee.

Founded in 1994, Frontier filed for bankruptcy-court protection in 2008. Republic Airways Holdings Inc., a commuter airline, purchased it the following year, but couldn't make it profitable.

Longtime airline investor William Franke was Spirit's chairman when Frontier came up for sale four years later. He urged Spirit's board to buy Frontier, but to no avail. So he sold his position in Spirit and resigned as the company's chairman to purchase Frontier through his private-equity fund, Indigo Partners LLC. He brought along a former Spirit executive, Barry Biffle, who now is Frontier's chief executive officer.

Mr. Franke cut costs and rebuilt Frontier on a model of charging extremely low fares but reaping fees for add-ons like carry-on luggage and advance seat assignment. He pushed Frontier's rapid U.S. expansion in markets, ranging from Orlando, Fla., to Cincinnati and Cleveland.

Frontier now serves about 55 cities in the U.S., Mexico and the Dominican Republic with about 275 daily flights.

The company posted profit of $200 million in 2016, on revenue of $1.7 billion. It carried 14.9 million passengers."
Ctit Group,Let Me Pay! I Have 29 Credit Cards --- Millennials hoard plastic to rack up rewards points," Apr 1, 2017",1,"When Kyle Allen gets home from work each day, he heads straight for his mailbox. ""It does give me a rush,"" says the 29-year-old financial analyst from Orlando.

What he hopes to find is yet another offer for a new credit card. He and his wife together have 40 of them and have earned, so far, 1,492,500 rewards points. They have used the points in an almost-completed quest to visit each destination named in the chorus of the Beach Boys song ""Kokomo.""

""I keep waiting for them to decline me,"" says Mr. Allen of the card companies. ""It just doesn't happen.""

Forget comic books or vintage lunchboxes. Credit cards, and the prizes they earn, are the hot new collectibles for millennials. Fanatics sign up for new cards in every city they visit. They get multiple versions of the same card. (That's often allowed.) They angle to use their cards to cover tabs at restaurants.

Driving their obsession is an arms race among credit-card companies to offer the best rewards. The trend has spawned blogs and message boards where card holders trade tips and brag about their conquests.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s Chase Sapphire Reserve card until recently offered a sign-up sweetener of 100,000 rewards points, potentially worth thousands of dollars when redeemed for travel, as many collectors have done. The card, launched last August, proved so popular that 10 days later the bank ran out of the metal required to make them.

Citigroup Inc., American Express Co. and other rivals have enhanced their own cards to compete.

""I'm kind of a credit-card -- maybe junkie is not the right word -- but I'm a credit-card enthusiast,"" says Mary Xu, a San Francisco cybersecurity manager. In pursuit of points, she spends more than $1,000 a year on annual fees for high-end cards.

She was so disappointed to be rejected for the Sapphire Reserve last October that she spent hours constructing a costume of the card out of cardboard. She sent the bank a photo of herself dressed up, hoping for a second chance.

She was approved about three months later.

""They got the sweet end of the deal over all,"" she says. ""I went to a Halloween party wearing it, and I'm positive they got at least a dozen referrals from me.""

Rewards fanatics are one reason new credit-card sign-ups in the third quarter of last year were 14% higher than in the year-earlier period, according to the most recent data from credit-reporting firm TransUnion Corp. Credit-card balances in the fourth quarter rose sharply among those under age 40, the firm says.

Many issuers don't limit the number of cards an individual can acquire. Payment history and overall debts usually are weighed more heavily than numbers of cards in application decisions. TransUnion Vice President Heather Battison says heavy card collectors who miss a payment could see their credit scores fall disproportionately compared with casual users.

Some cardholders move on to a fresh card as soon as they earn their bonus on one.

Washington, D.C., communications director Daniel Seaton, 31, signed up for a new card not available at home when he was on business in New York in February. It was his 29th new card in the past 18 months. ""I've definitely kind of scolded friends for using a debit card,"" he says.

Ike Lee, 25, a student at Yale School of Medicine, has 16 cards and no income. When friends told him they needed furniture for a new apartment, he hatched a plan to pay for it himself with a card that offers 5% cash back on furniture purchases. He intends to give them a 3% discount when they reimburse him, netting himself a bit of cash.

Benjamin Gowdy of Gorham, Maine, 34, a real-estate investor, pitched his girlfriend on a four-hour road trip to nab a Chase sign-up bonus that required an in-person application. ""I don't really feel like blowing up a whole Saturday to sit in a bank,"" he recalls her responding.

He eventually prevailed, and he and his girlfriend, Anna Gardner, set off at dawn in early March in his decade-old Toyota Prius for the nearest Chase branch -- in Connecticut. They arrived to find a charged-up mob of other applicants.

""The crowd made Anna feel like I was a little less insane,"" Mr. Gowdy says. Ms. Gardner, 32, signed up for a card, too. ""I ate a little crow there,"" she says.

A J.P. Morgan Chase spokeswoman marvels at the motivation of applicants. ""They're crazy!"" she says.

Over the past year, Chase has signed up tens of thousands of new credit-card customers, with more than half of the high-priced Sapphire Reserve cards going to millennials, the spokeswoman says.

San Antonio engineer Marshall Sharp, 31, uses an Excel spreadsheet to track the due dates for the 24 credit cards he has acquired in the past 11 months.

Because he doesn't spend enough to qualify for all the rewards, he heads to a local mall and uses his credit cards to buy cash-equivalent prepaid cards, earning points in the process. Then he uses the prepaid cards to pay off his credit-card balances.

""The same sort of loop is used for money laundering,"" Mr. Sharp says. ""Some of my co-workers joke that if the FBI comes, we'll know where to point them.""

The practice is legal, though discouraged by card companies.

Donovan Frost, 25, a Los Angeles software account manager, broke out his card at a New Year's celebration this year to cover a $300 group bar tab so he could collect a hefty credit-card bonus tied to restaurant spending.

Some of his friends reimbursed him with cash.

""Cash?"" he recalls thinking. ""What am I going to do with that?"""
Ctit Group,Banks' Revenue From Stock Trading Takes a Hit," Mar 31, 2017",1,"Stocks have climbed to records over the past year, but the business of trading shares is in a slump.

Stock-trading revenue at U.S. banks fell 13% in 2016 from the previous year, according to recent figures from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The slide contrasts with a 9% rise in overall trading driven by interest-rate and currency products. Globally, the biggest dozen banks had a 13% drop in stock trading in 2016, the first meaningful annual decline since 2012, according to research firm Coalition.

Now, as the first quarter wraps up this week, bankers say the weakness experienced last year is continuing. That is prompting concerns about whether banks should be preparing for a longer-lasting decline in the business, rather than a cyclical dip.

""Client volumes are down . . . that's an industry issue,"" said Morgan Stanley President Colm Kelleher at a conference in late March. When comparing Morgan Stanley's first quarter of this year with the last quarter of 2016, he concluded that the stocks business was ""not doing as well.""

Stock trading isn't as big at many Wall Street banks as bond and currency trading. But it still accounted for $28 billion in revenue for the top five U.S. banks in 2016, or more than 10% of their total revenue.

Banks generate equities revenue in a variety of ways: from executing trades to buying and selling stock-related derivatives to services such as locating shares for clients to bet against.

The stock-trading-revenue falloff is deepening despite higher volumes and big index price swings in the wake of the U.K.'s vote in June to exit from the European Union and November's U.S. presidential election.

Overall, subdued volatility in stock markets leads more trades to be executed via the cheapest electronic means, rather than by banks' traders or through more expensive and complex derivatives. Equity-derivatives revenue fell 21% last year globally, according to Coalition, which works with banks to track industry trends.

Morgan Stanley and Oliver Wyman estimated in a recent report that some $15 billion in expected equity revenue has vanished, due to ""changes in client behavior and the growing role of electronic trading.""

Plus, they said, about 15% of the fee pool in the biggest, most liquid markets, such as stocks, has moved to nonbank firms. Those firms can cheaply execute standard trades such as moving in and out of exchange-traded funds.

Banks tend to earn more money when investors are willing to pay more to get trades done quickly or at guaranteed prices due to worries over unpredictable price movements. Those fears have dropped. Expectations of stock volatility fell in both the U.S. and Europe overall last year, and has dropped further in 2017.

Virtually all trading today involves electronic algorithms in some fashion, but some are more complex than others. Banks charge clients about four times the rate for the most complex individual ""high-touch"" trades than ones that simply follow a preset portfolio strategy, according to Greenwich Associates.

Meanwhile, investment firms have balked at paying higher trading fees to banks because of a shift by their own clients to index funds, which command much lower fees.

""If asset-management fees and revenue are under pressure, how can their suppliers do well?"" said Christian Edelmann, head of the global investment-banking and asset-management practices at Oliver Wyman.

The shift away from active trading has also hurt some of Wall Street's best clients. Some hedge funds, which typically generate big fees for banks, have been shutting down.

Banks had already been responding to some of the changes. Over the past decade, banks shifted resources from human trading and research to high-speed electronic markets.

For a while, that pivot paid off. From 2012 to 2015, stock-trading revenue at banks either rose or stayed relatively stable, a contrast to fixed-income trading, which was hurt by regulatory changes and central banks' low interest-rate policies.

The respite didn't last for stocks. As revenue tumbled in 2016, operating margins in stock trading also dropped to 23% from 36% the prior year, according to Coalition.

The operating margins for completing stock trades fell to just 5% last year, according to Amrit Shahani, research director at Coalition. It was more than 7% in 2015 and more than 10% before the financial crisis.

Several banks in the past year have retrenched. U.K.-based Barclays PLC has closed its ""high-touch"" stock sales-and-trading desks in Asia. Japan's Nomura Holdings Inc. cut its research and derivatives in European stocks. CLSA, a unit of China's Citic Securities Co., closed its U.S. stock-research team.

Meanwhile, the biggest banks in stock trading are trying to expand market share in the prime brokerage business, in which banks lend money to clients who sometimes bet against stock prices.

Mr. Kelleher of Morgan Stanley said the bank could stave off declines in stock revenue globally with its strong prime brokerage. Citigroup Inc. said it hopes to gain share in equities by expanding its prime brokerage offerings."
Ctit Group,"Globalization Backers Face End of an Era --- Nations and companies scramble to adapt to bigger barriers to trade, finance"," Mar 30, 2017",1,"After World War II, the global economy rose on a wave of trade and finance, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in developing countries and providing rich countries with cheaper goods, lucrative investments and hopes for a more peaceful planet.

That tide is now receding.

Nine years after the financial crisis, global trade is barely growing when compared with overall economic output. Cross-border bank lending is down sharply, as are international capital flows. Immigration in the U.S. and Western Europe faces a deepening public backlash.

Nationalist politicians are on the ascent. On Wednesday, the United Kingdom formally started proceedings to remove itself from the European Union. In the U.S., President Donald Trump pulled out of a Pacific trade pact on his first working day in the Oval Office, declaring, ""Great thing for the American worker, what we just did.""

For traditional economists, globalization is a pathway to prosperity. Rooted in the works of Adam Smith in 1776 and David Ricardo in 1817, the classical canon has embraced the idea that trade is the basis for wealth because it makes nations more efficient by allowing each to specialize at what its workers do best.

Few of them fully grasped globalization's downsides in a modern economy. Tying together disparate nations economically also expanded the labor pool globally, pitting workers in wealthy nations against poorly paid ones in developing nations. That greatly boosted the fortunes of the world's poor, but also created a backlash in the U.S. and Europe. At the same time, freeing financial flows led to debilitating financial excesses that ended in crisis.

""Globalization is in retreat,"" Larry Fink, the chief executive of the big investment firm BlackRock Inc., said in a February memo to employees, outlining a new corporate strategy. ""We need to be German in Germany, Japanese in Japan and Mexican in Mexico.""

An earlier era of globalization, which stretched from 1870 to 1913, ended when the world descended into war. Rising trade barriers later played a role in the Great Depression of the 1930s. The present era may not turn out as catastrophically, but nations, companies, multilateral institutions and ordinary citizens are already scrambling to adapt to a world with bigger barriers to trade and finance as blowback builds.

Big banks, such as Citigroup and HSBC, have reduced their global footprints. Industrial firms like General Electric are developing strategies for a more localized world. Guardians of globalization, like the World Trade Organization, struggle with challenges from China and other emerging powers. Poor nations are finding it harder to count on exports for economic development. Wealthy nations face less hospitable overseas markets, while their workers grapple with the demands of automated workplaces.

Critics of globalization said a slowdown in cross-border trade and finance will help ease pressure on wages of unskilled workers in wealthy nations, stem the threat of financial bubbles and reduce the influence of multinational companies in developing nations.

""Maybe the U.S. will supply more of its demand by itself,"" said Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a policy research group in Washington, D.C., who has long urged the U.S. adopt more aggressive trade policies. ""That could be a good thing and create jobs.""

During the globalization epoch that started after World War II, trade growth usually far outpaced -- and helped drive -- overall economic output. Now it is barely keeping up. The slowdown has long outlasted the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009, which helped set it off.

Between 2011 and 2015, the value of global merchandise exports contracted 10%, according to the WTO, marking the largest drop over a four-year period in post-World War II history, driven in part by tumbling commodities prices. Merchandise export growth over a 10-year time frame is also the slowest of this era.

""We have a deflationary mind-set,"" Jakob Stausholm, chief financial officer of Maersk, the Danish shipping giant, told investors in February, while reporting a $1.9 billion loss. A few days earlier a court in Seoul declared that Hanjin Shipping Co., the world's seventh-largest shipper, was heading for liquidation.

Among the hottest trends in the industry last year was the dismantling of giant container ships for scrap metal -- 862 in all -- along the beaching yards of Pakistan, Bangladesh and India.

Annual movement of capital across borders -- in the form of stock and bond purchases, foreign direct investment and lending -- fell more than two-thirds, to $3.3 trillion in 2015 from $11.9 trillion in 2007, according to McKinsey & Co. Overseas bank lending, particularly from Europe, has been hard hit. The stock of cross-border loans held at banks around the world contracted 21%, to $28.2 trillion in the third quarter of 2016 from $35.5 trillion in 2008, according to the Bank for International Settlements.

Peterson Institute for International Economics trade economist Gary Hufbauer calculates that U.S. output in 2016 was $2 trillion greater than it otherwise would have been because of greater trade and financial integration since 1950. Slowing the pace of globalization will actually slow U.S. income gains, he said.

No less is at stake for a country such as Ethiopia, which has averaged growth rates in excess of 10% for the past decade as part of a push toward industrialization and greater international exposure. The country has little to fall back on if its globalization bet sours.

Hoping to emulate China's ride on the globalization wave, Ethiopia is building a half-dozen manufacturing zones to produce garments, textiles and shoes for multinational firms, along with railroads and power plants. The construction spree, which keeps the air in Addis Ababa thick with dust, has created rising external debt loads, which jumped to $20.4 billion in 2015 from $2.3 billion in 2006, according to the World Bank.

Ethiopia's prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, said the debt is a price he is willing to pay. ""If you want to move in an easy way, then you can't achieve double-digit growth,"" he said in a recent interview. ""We have to carefully manage it, but there is a way out also. We have a huge potential in terms of exports.""

The lethargic recovery from the global recession, especially weak demand for capital goods and big investment projects, helps to explain the global trade slowdown.

Protectionism is another cause. Global Trade Alert, a trade monitoring group, counts nearly 7,000 protectionist measures enacted world-wide since the recession of 2009. About half of the measures are aimed at China.

It has been 23 years since the completion of the last global trade deal in 1994 and no other is on the horizon. Since 2008, the International Monetary Fund reports, tariff reductions have been ""minimal,"" after falling by about 1 percentage point a year between 1986 and 1995 and 0.5 percentage points annually for the following 13 years.

Multinational companies used the 1990s and 2000s to build global supply chains -- for instance linking rubber plantations in Malaysia to tire manufacturers in China and retailers in the U.S., or coffee growers in Colombia to Starbucks restaurants.

These webs of commerce supercharged trade but have begun to retrench, as companies localize their production and import fewer components for assembly. The World Bank said global supply chains stopped growing around 2011 after expanding about 4% annually for the previous two decades.

General Electric Co., which since the 1980s has expanded its global footprint, said it is time for a ""bold pivot"" in strategy to focus on regional centers. In explaining the move last year, GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said he would prefer to operate by free-trade principles, but ""a localization strategy can't be shut down by protectionist politics.""

In practice, that means GE is building up its manufacturing capacity in China and India and other big markets to supply customers there, rather than counting on exports and global links. As part of the strategy, GE signed a deal in 2015 to build locomotives in India, rather than relying on a global production site in the U.S., as it once did.

Surveying the global economy from Beijing, where he co-owns eight electronics and medical equipment factories, Dwight Nordstrom, chairman of Pacific Resources International LLC, said he is ""waiting to see how the politics shake out"" before building any Chinese plants aimed at the export market.

That is because local-content rules may require firms like his to build factories in different countries. ""We may be forced to have more factories than makes economic sense,"" he said.

China, once an assembly platform that sucked in commodities and manufactured goods from abroad, put them together and reshipped them, is now producing much of what it needs domestically.

Benjamin Dolgin-Gardner, founder of Hatch International Ltd., an electronics manufacturer in Shenzhen, China, said he now uses Chinese-made LCD screens rather than ones made elsewhere in Asia forthe tablets he produces. Memory chips for MP3 players are also made in China rather than imported from Japan and South Korea.

""China is increasingly cannibalizing supply chains,"" said Alex Wolf, a London economist at the investment firm of Standard Life Investments, reducing exports from Korea, Taiwan and other nations whose economies are tightly linked to China's.

The reaction to the financial crisis in many countries included new banking rules, adopted globally, which require banks to hold bigger capital buffers against securities and loans. That has cut into their willingness to take risks across borders.

Regulators in China, Cyprus, Iceland, Brazil and other countries imposed capital controls to limit the waves of potentially destabilizing money washing into and out of their financial systems. In all, 31 out of 108 countries tracked by economists Menzie Chinn and Hiro Ito became less open to global capital flows between 2008 and 2014, while 13 became more open.

That is a sharp reversal from the five-year precrisis period, when 40 countries became more open to global capital flows and 12 became less open.

Europe is the epicenter of the global lending crunch. Hungary privatized most of its banks after the fall of Communism in 1989, drawing investors from Austria, Italy, Belgium and beyond. By the mid-2000s, Hungarian homeowners had become avid consumers of mortgages issued by Austrian banks denominated in Swiss francs, emblematic of the rapid globalization of European finance.

After the financial crisis, the Swiss franc soared, pushing up the cost of those mortgages. Nearly one-third of Hungarian borrowers went 90 days or more delinquent on their mortgages, inviting a political backlash.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's nationalist Fidesz party won parliamentary elections with a landslide in 2010 and Mr. Orban set out to increase Hungarian ownership of the banking sector to at least 50%. His administration imposed taxes and fees on the sector and demanded banks convert Swiss franc loans into local currency denominations. Foreign bank lending contracted for eight straight years through 2016, according to the Institute of International Finance, a banking trade association in Washington.

As foreign banks departed, the country's economy minister, Mihaly Varga, told local reporters that the policy ""boosts economic sovereignty."" A 2016 review by the IMF, while lauding Hungary's rebound from the recession, said the government had simply shifted risks from private hands to the public sector because the Hungarian government took big stakes in banks and other companies.

In wealthy nations, the big hope is that a reversal in globalization will lift wages of unskilled workers by reducing competition from low-wage nations. That hasn't been the case so far. Globally, wage growth slowed to an average 2.1% in the past five years, compared with 2.4% in the five years leading up to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, according to the International Labor Organization.

In the U.S., wages and salaries of workers rose 2% a year in the past five years. That is down from 2.9% in the five years before the crisis.

That hasn't stilled globalization's many critics. ""Globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very, very wealthy,"" Mr. Trump said last June at a Rust Belt stop in Pennsylvania, ""but it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache."""
Ctit Group,J.P. Morgan Scouts Out Europe," Mar 30, 2017",0,"LONDON -- A group of 75 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. staff spent the past nine months evaluating European cities on factors ranging from employment law to the frequency of flight delays at local airports.

They are picking the bank's new homes after Britain's exit from the European Union.

The bank is checking out as many as eight cities, including Paris, Frankfurt, Luxembourg and Dublin, people familiar with the plans say. Its staffers have begun pulling together paperwork to apply for licenses. It has scouted for real estate in locations such as Dublin and Frankfurt. A final decision on its Brexit plans will be made in coming months.

J.P. Morgan is a U.S. giant, but it employs 16,000 people in the U.K., and in 2015 a third of its $33.5 billion of investment-banking revenue came from Europe, the Middle East and Africa. That makes it Europe's largest investment bank and one of the most prominent among scores of foreign lenders trying to figure out their post-Brexit futures.

On Wednesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May officially declared the U.K.'s intention to quit the EU, touching off fraught negotiations with Brussels. London's banking industry will be a key sticking point.

Like its American peers, J.P. Morgan concentrated much of its European corporate and investment-banking activities in London. A cluster of British legal entities also handles its clients in Asia and Latin America, and a sprawling back-office operation in the English seaside town of Bournemouth helps process transactions for its global clients. For its European clients, that compact setup might not function after Brexit.

Under current EU rules, J.P. Morgan can sell products to European clients from London and set up a network of branches across the Continent. But after Brexit that will probably no longer be the case.

J.P. Morgan Chief Executive James Dimon has said up to a quarter of the company's staff in the U.K. may have to move.

Fixing the bank's structure for Brexit isn't easy. Maintaining an office on the Continent isn't enough to insulate the bank from Brexit's effects. For instance, J.P. Morgan has operated a fancy office on Paris's Place Vendome for over a century. But that Paris office is only a branch, or outpost, of its U.S. business. If J.P. Morgan decides to turn Paris into a hub that can sell products across the whole of Europe, it has a choice. It can either connect the Paris branch to another European subsidiary or get regulatory clearance to transform it into a subsidiary and pump in capital.

Currently, J.P. Morgan has three European subsidiaries with banking licenses: a bank in Dublin, one in Luxembourg and a Frankfurt-based investment bank that handles some of the lender's euro clearing operations.

It also has branches in several major European cities, including Amsterdam, Milan and Brussels.

The bank's executives are still deciding which operating model to use. Given the uncertainty around Brexit negotiations, the bank is hedging its bets and considering plans to scale up both branches and subsidiaries, according to people familiar with the plan.

Once the divorce talks begin, banks will embark on a balancing act.

The longer they wait to adjust operations, the more clarity they will have regarding the Brexit deal the U.K. may get. But if they wait too long, they may not have enough time to implement changes before the two-year negotiations finish.

""It's complex and there is no easy solution to this,"" said Joe Cassidy, a partner at consultancy KPMG.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which already has a banking license in Frankfurt, is upgrading infrastructure in several European cities and is preparing to shift hundreds of staff, Richard Gnodde, a vice chairman at the bank, said recently. Morgan Stanley favors Dublin as its main European subsidiary but is considering Paris and Frankfurt as secondary options, according to people familiar with the plan.

At Citigroup Inc., executives have a spreadsheet rating cities on 26 factors as it decides where to shift a chunk of its London-based investment bank, according to executives."
Ctit Group,"Oil Investors Tap Deep Cash Well --- Riverstone, ex-energy CEO raise $1 billion in largest such stock sale in a decade"," Mar 25, 2017",1,"Investors handed a blank check for $1 billion to a New York investment firm and a retired-energy-CEO-turned-theology-student so they can hunt for an oil business to buy.

In staking Silver Run Acquisition Corp. II, investors are hoping that Riverstone Holdings LLC, the energy-focused investment firm, can repeat the success of a similarly named entity it launched last year with another big-name oil executive.

That blank-check company, led by Mark Papa, who earlier built an Enron Corp. castoff into one of the largest U.S. oil producers, last year raised $500 million. It put the cash toward buying a pair of closely held West Texas oil producers. Now known as Centennial Resource Development Inc., its shares have been among the energy industry's best performers, up 72% since the February 2016 listing.

Investors in the latest Riverstone endeavor are betting on the second-act of James Hackett, who transformed Anadarko Petroleum Corp. from an oil patch also-ran into one of the world's largest energy explorers before retiring in 2013 to get a theology degree at Harvard Divinity School.

The stock sale, which launched Thursday and raised a little over $1 billion, including shares that the banks managing the deal bought, tied the record for the largest blank-check offering set a decade ago, according to Dealogic.

The Silver Run shares gained 3.6% in their stock-market debut Friday, an unusual move in the early days of such a company.

Blank-check companies, also called special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, start with no assets and sell shares to raise cash that they then use to make acquisitions. They traditionally have attracted hedge funds willing to make speculative bets on specific deal makers, but these days bankers say they are pitched to a broader swath of investors.

Centennial's surging shares have made energy investors particularly bullish on this style of deal making.

Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors LP, a Los Angeles private-equity firm focused on pipelines, filed paperwork earlier this month to raise as much as $402 million for a blank-check company. Last month NGP, a Dallas firm known for staking wildcatters, said in filings it would seek $460 million.

In a SPAC that could rival those of Riverstone for star power, TPG is in talks to launch a blank-check company headed by former Occidental Petroleum Corp. Chief Executive Stephen Chazen, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Riverstone's Thursday offering more than doubled in size from the $400 million the deal makers first proposed in securities filings three weeks ago, showing investors' enthusiasm but also raising a question about how much demand will remain.

Mr. Hackett joined Riverstone as a partner right after leaving Anadarko, juggling his studies with his duties as a member of the committee that vets deals and makes investment decisions for the firm.

In an interview Friday, he said the SPAC will look for acquisitions in the U.S. and Canada, favor oil over natural gas and consider pipeline businesses. He said he might be the CEO, but he is also open to being chairman if the acquired company comes with strong management that wants to stay on. Oil prices, roughly double what they were at the depths of the bust, are in a sweet spot for deal making, Mr. Hackett said.

""If people feel the price is much too low and it will recover quickly, which is where we were a year and a half ago, the bid-offer spread gets too wide and activity starts to drop,"" the 63-year-old said.

In those circumstances, he said, ""people want to hold onto things.""

SPACs were a hallmark of the frothy days before the financial crisis, but fizzled in its wake. Some big blank-check companies, such as Nelson Peltz's Trian Acquisition I Corp., which raised $920 million in 2008, were unable to make acquisitions within the customary two-year time period, forcing them to fold and give cash back to investors.

In recent years, though, SPACs have come back. Since 2015, investors have given nine-figure blank checks to well-known deal makers to pursue acquisitions in consumer products, technology and chemicals.

Last year, a SPAC acquired Twinkie-maker Hostess Brands Inc. after it went public. Earlier this month, a blank-check company launched by TPG bought a chain of Caribbean resorts.

SPACs have their risks beyond the uncertainty of what businesses they would buy. Investors face the possibility that their cash will be locked up for two years with no results. Energy investors face particular challenges with oil prices hovering around $50 a barrel: The number of regions where drilling is economical are limited and prices for assets, such as drilling land in the Permian Basin in West Texas, have soared.

SPACs offer some advantages to big energy investors, bankers say. For one, they give private-equity firms the cash to pursue large purchases without risking too much of their fund investors' cash in any one deal.

They are also a quick way to list closely held companies and businesses carved out of big corporations on stock exchanges where they can then raise additional cash to grow.

And sellers sometimes are willing to take discounts to cash out of investments completely, rather than risk slower exits through their own initial public offerings of stock.

Banks that worked on the deal included Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc."
Ctit Group,A Different Spin on Bike-Sharing," Mar 25, 2017",0,"Urban bike-sharing programs in the U.S. have often been a sinkhole for investors, with low takeup rates and high operating costs requiring public subsidies.

Chinese startups think they have a solution: ""dockless"" bike-sharing.

A surge of money into these bike-sharing companies this year has led to an explosion of smartphone-activated two-wheelers across China's cities. The programs don't limit bike parking and pickup to docking stations, instead using public bike racks or sidewalk space -- a convenience that has yielded millions of riders but also a profusion of haphazardly parked bikes clogging sidewalks in cities such as Shanghai.

The dockless approach has enabled two Chinese bike-sharing giants, Beijing-based Ofo Inc. and rival Beijing Mobike Technology Co., to scale up rapidly: their fleets each exceed a million bikes, up from a combined total of more than 100,000 in October, and operate in three dozen cities. Their valuations top $1 billion each, according to people familiar with the situation.

Neither company is profitable. Representatives from both say expansion and China are the focus -- with the U.S. seen as fertile ground. Both companies displayed their bikes at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas, this month. Ofo, whose yellow bike business attracted Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook to its office in Beijing recently, wants to deploy a fleet of 50,000 shared bikes in about 10 U.S. cities by July.

Beijing-based Bluegogo International Inc., a bike-share upstart that raised $58 million in funding this year, began testing in San Francisco with 200 of its signature blue bikes. The city has a traditional bike-sharing program run by Motivate International Inc. and Bluegogo got off to a bumpy start.

City officials fearing scenes of sidewalk-strewn bikes asked the company to obtain permits before starting its service. Bluegogo, which initially intended to park its blue bicycles in public bike racks, switched plans to bike stations in private parking spaces, said Ilya Movshovich, Bluegogo's vice president for U.S. operations. Talks are under way with at least five more unspecified U.S. cities, he said.

Tighter government restrictions mean dockless bike-sharing companies face an uphill climb to succeed where traditional programs have largely failed. There were 70 traditional bike-share operators across 104 U.S. cities as of last April, according to the Bureau of Transportation. Some have been hamstrung by a shortfall of funding or membership in recent years.

Motivate runs bike-sharing programs in 11 U.S. cities. Its largest operation, New York Citi Bike, has 10,000 bikes and chalked up 14 million rides in 2016, a North American bike-share record, the company said. The program is backed by Citigroup Inc.

Scaling up quickly is critical for the Chinese operators. Ofo and Mobike received the bulk of the more than $800 million that has poured into China's bike-sharing startups since Jan. 1, according to Dow Jones VentureSource data.

Investors say they have been encouraged by high demand in China. Mobike said more than 10 million participants have taken 400 million rides since its operations began in April 2016. Ofo, which launched as a student project at Peking University in 2014, says it has 20 million users.

The bikes are aimed at commuters who need ""last-mile"" transportation to take them short distances from subway or bus stations. People use a smartphone app to unlock a GPS-equipped bike from a parking spot and then ride it as far as they want -- for about 10 cents for a 30-minute ride in China -- before parking them in designated areas.

""You can buy a bike, but then you worry about it being stolen, you worry about where to park it and maintain it. So it is compelling to have a bike-sharing concept,"" said Tay Choon Chong, managing partner at Vertex Ventures China and an early Mobike investor.

Mobike, backed by Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. and private-equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC, entered the Singapore market with its orange-and-silver bikes this week. Ofo has investors including Facebook Inc. investor Yuri Milner. It is already running trials in San Diego and Cambridge in the U.K.

Ofo and Bluegogo declined to provide details on new cities they are targeting.

Some venture capitalists see obstacles. Ken Xu, managing director of Gobi Ventures, passed on the chance to invest in Ofo, concerned that people wouldn't ride on rainy or heavily polluted days. Theft and vandalism were also a concern, Mr. Xu said.

Zhang Yanqi, Ofo's chief operating officer, said less than 1% of its bike fleet was lost or damaged, and that incidences will decline as users get accustomed to shared bikes. Mobike said losses from theft and damage were negligible. GPS tracking devices on its bikes allow the company to monitor their locations.

As competition heats up in China, where there are more than 20 bike-sharing companies, so too in the U.S.

Venture capitalist Andreessen Horowitz recently invested $12 million in Limebike, a California-based startup looking to introduce a dockless bike-share nationwide. The startup is run by current and former Chinese venture capitalists. Limebike hopes to learn from missteps made by Chinese startups by engaging with officials in 10 cities before launching its dockless bikes, said co-founder Brad Bao. One measure would be to deploy teams to deal with issues such as stray bikes.

Ctit Group,Banking &amp; Finance: Wells Fargo Takes Deep Dive Into Culture," Mar 22, 2017",0,"Wells Fargo & Co. has admitted it has culture problems related to its sales-practices scandal. Now, it is turning to an academic for help.

Chief Executive Timothy Sloan said at a company town hall Tuesday that the bank is aiming to survey all its roughly 269,000 employees about its culture, working with an academic who specializes in this area. The bank declined to name the academic, though the 20- to 30-minute survey will roll out in May.

The bank declined to say when the survey will be completed, but Mr. Sloan said the analysis and proposed actions will be shared with senior executives.

He added that ""high-level results"" will be shared with bank employees.

""Our goal is to uncover our culture's positive attributes and its potential weaknesses, so our leaders can understand how best to foster an ethical, inclusive, and customer-focused culture,"" Mr. Sloan said.

The push comes at an opportune time. Earlier Tuesday, a regulator continued to jab Wells Fargo about its culture problems. Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley said in remarks prepared for a speech in London that the Wells Fargo sales-practices scandal is just one example of how banks have to improve their cultures.

""There was a serious mismatch between the values Wells Fargo espoused and the incentives that Wells Fargo employed,"" Mr. Dudley said in prepared remarks. He has been one of the most outspoken regulators on bank culture in recent years.

Speaking at the bank's Orlando, Fla., event, Mr. Sloan echoed the criticism. ""This is why our operating committee and I agree on this important point: If there's one thing we must get right as we lead Wells Fargo forward, it is our culture,"" he said according to prepared remarks.

Wells Fargo in September paid a $185 million fine over opening as many as 2.1 million accounts using fictitious or unauthorized customer information. It has since faced a barrage of public and political criticism and investigations.

Mr. Sloan said the San Francisco bank used a different type of survey for seven years about how engaged its employees are, includinghow they score on a happy-to-grumpy ratio.

Since the sales-practices scandal erupted in September, the bank has sent surveys to more than 110,000 employees about its culture, Mr. Sloan said. But it wants to dig deeper.

This isn't the first time Mr. Sloan addressed the culture problems facing the bank. In a late-October company town hall, he admitted ""things that need to be fixed withinour culture. There are weaknesses within it that we must change."" He said that starts with understanding where things ""broke down, and where we failed -- as a culture, a company and as leaders.""

Mr. Sloan then said Wells Fargo would hire outside independent ""culture experts"" to help it understand where its weaknesses are.

The bank also has said the lofty retail-banking sales goals it has since done away with drove its culture. Those changes, along with restructuring how employees are compensated, will filter through the workforce and take time to change.

Wells Fargo isn't the only bank turning to academics for culture assistance. Citigroup Inc. has an on-call ethicist it consults on weighty questions of right and wrong."
citigroup,Granny's hedge Funds flock to 'risky' bank stocks," Apr 6, 2017",1,"Come on, hedgies - you call bank stocks an alternative investment?
Hedge funds' exposure to bank stocks hit record levels at the start of 2017, but many may have piled into the trade
too late.
Hedge funds had 5.1 percent - or $33 billion - of their portfolios invested in financial institutions at the start of the
year, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report released Wednesday.
Both figures were record highs since Bank of America started tracking such data in 2005.
Among the hedge funds buying into the enthusiasm was Dan Loeb's Third Point, which holds Bank of America and
JPMorgan Chase.
""On November 8th, our financials portfolio was 4.4 percent of the fund. One day later, it was 6 percent, one week
later, 10.5 percent; one month later, 11.8 percent,"" Loeb wrote in a February letter to investors.
Other banks favored by hedge funds are Citigroup and Wells Fargo.
Most bank stocks rallied immediately following the November election on expectations of a more Wall Streetfriendly,
regulation-light administration. The early buyers were quickly rewarded, but laggards may have lost.
While the KBW bank index is up 15 percent since the election, it is down 1.3 percent this year.
Even worse, hedge funds may have missed what is looking like the better play for 2017.
As funds money poured into financials, it was pulled out of technology, with financial weights growing by 2 percent
and technology falling by 4.1 percent, the Bank of America report said.
The broader financial industry is up only 1.7 percent year to date, while technology has soared 10.2 percent, with
hedgie favorites like Apple and Facebook up more than 20 percent."
citigroup,"2 beats on Wall Street JPM, Citi top views"," Apr 14, 2017",1,"Two of the country's largest banks - JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup - said Thursday they had a solid first quarter,
while a third, Wells Fargo, continued to struggle.
JPMorgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon said that the rest of the year will likely be a ""sausage-making"" period for
President Trump's business-friendly agenda and that he didn't expect the process to be easy.
""You all should expect as a given that, when you have a new president and they get going, that the nine months
after the first 100 days are a sausage-making period,"" he said during a Thursday analyst call discussing the bank's
first-quarter earnings.
""To expect there to be smooth sailing, that would be silly,"" said Dimon, who's also the head of the Washington
lobbying group Business Roundtable.
The comments came after JPMorgan reported a 17 percent rise in profit for its first quarter, driven primarily by
more trading. The Wall Street bank made $6.45 billion in profit from January to March, or $1.65 a share.
That was better than the $1.52 a share that analysts had predicted.
Shares of JPMorgan, amid a broader market sell-off, fell 1.2 percent, to $84.40.
Citigroup reported a 17 percent boost in profit, to $4.09 billion, or $1.35 a share, beating expectations. Analysts had
expected $1.24.
The profit increase at Michael Corbat's bank came thanks to a boost in bond trading, spurred by a rise in interest
rates.
Revenue came in at $18.1 billion, compared with the $17.8 billion Wall Street expected.
Citi's shares slipped 47 cents, to $58.04.
At Wells Fargo, customers have still not returned after a 2016 phony account scandal singed its reputation.
The scandal-ridden bank admitted Thursday that it saw drastic declines in new applications for credit cards and
checking accounts, two key products that were at the center of Wells' cross-selling controversy.
Credit-card applications plunged by 42 percent, to 200,000, during the first three months of the year, the bank said
in its earnings release. New checking account applications fell by 35 percent, to 400,000.
Wells on Thursday reported a profit of $5.46 billion, or $1 a share, about flat with last year. It beats forecasts of 97
cents.
The tepid results sent shares tumbling 3.3 percent, to $51.35"
citigroup,Shooting Blanks Goldman's wimpy Q1 pushes shares off cliff," Apr 19, 2017",0,"Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein has delivered a clunker.
The white-shoe investment bank posted disappointing earnings for the first quarter, with trading revenue -
traditionally the bank's big moneymaker - ceding ground to rivals with less-fancy names.
Despite easy comparisons with last year's abysmal first quarter, when stocks and bonds had slumped amid
corporate skittishness over the economy, Goldman on Tuesday reported $1.69 billion in revenue from trading in
bonds, currencies and commodities - a paltry 1-percent increase.
The results were ""a shock,"" wrote Dick Bove, an analyst at Rafferty Capital Markets, in a note.
""None of this company's competitors have fared this poorly in the first quarter,"" he added.
Goldman's stock got hammered on the disappointing news, falling 4.7 percent, to $215.59, its lowest close since
late November.
That shaved off $4.5 billion in market capitalization by the end of the day, making Tuesday the biggest single-day
selloff since June 24, the day after Britain voted to leave the European Union.
Weak trading income plagued a period that had seemed tailored to boost Goldman Sachs' profit: Donald Trump
had come into office stacked with at least half a dozen Goldman alumni (including longtime No. 2 Gary Cohn), the
Federal Reserve was hiking interest rates and bankers sold the ""Trump trade"" to willing investors who were finally
ready to buy again.
""Ultimately, we didn't navigate the market well, but no quarter defines the franchise,"" Marty Chavez, Goldman's
incoming chief financial officer, said during an analyst phone call.
He suggested that unusually calm markets were responsible for the slowdown in trading for the first three months
of 2017. But that didn't seem to have the same impact on Goldman's rivals.
In the quarter, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America all posted significant increases in revenue from
trading in bonds, currencies and commodities. JPMorgan posted a 17-percent uptick in revenue.
Citi's rose 19 percent, and BofA's grew nearly 17 percent - versus Goldman's 1-percent gain.
It's not exactly clear why Goldman stumbled while the other banks soared, though its reliance on hedge funds and
junk bonds - which both lagged last quarter - may have had something to do with it, Bloomberg News reported.
Overall, Goldman posted $2.26 billion in profit, or $5.15 a share, which was a 99 percent increase from last year's
weak first quarter.
Analysts had expected about $5.31 a share.
The earnings add insult to injury for Goldman, which struggled last year to define itself against its peers amid a
vastly changing Wall Street landscape, where trading is largely being executed by computer programs and cost
cutting has been the most reliable way to post profits.
Separately on Tuesday, Bank of America posted better-than-expected profits of $4.86 billion, or 41 cents a share -
up 44 percent, in part from an increase in trading revenue.

citigroup,Taxes not in the can Not until '18: banks," Apr 22, 2017",1,"Wall Street banks aren't buying the White House line that tax reform can be OK'd this year.
Even as President Trump on Friday vowed to introduce new details about a tax code overhaul on April 26, major US
banks don't see Congress passing the White House plan before 2018, according to statements by executives and reports put out by the financial institutions.
Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley have all recently voiced doubt on
such an aggressive tax overhaul timetable.
Trump's insistence on pushing for an Obamacare repeal and replacement is getting in the way, the banks said.
""I'm not holding my breath,"" Paul Christopher, head global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute,
told The Post on Friday about the passage of tax cuts. ""If you want to do health care before tax, we don't have a
plan and you've already lost a few months. How are we going to do this this year?""
Last week, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said that Washington is likely to be consumed with ""sausage-making"" for
the next nine months. He had previously said he didn't expect that Trump would sign any tax legislation before
January.
And Goldman - which has at least a half-dozen alums in the Trump administration - decried the ""continued delays""
that health care has imposed on the tax reform timeline, according to a note this week.
The pessimism flies in the face of Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, himself a former Goldman banker, who said
on Thursday that he hopes passing a tax plan ""won't take til the end of the year"" - even though in February he said
he wanted to have it done by August.
With a little more than a week before Trump crosses the 100-day mark, there are few details about the Trump tax
cut plan - although Mnuchin has said it would be ""sweeping.""
One of the key holdups in the tax plan is whether to adopt a 20 percent tax on imports, a hallmark of the House
Republican plan that has become increasingly unpopular.
""That's what the US is complaining that other countries do to us now,"" Christopher said. ""[Exporting countries]
could retaliate against us in any number of ways.""
Morgan Stanley, which also sees little hope for taxes this year, said that some budget hawks have softened their
stances, and can live with ""deficit expansion"" - meaning they'd cut taxes without finding a way to pay for them.
One of the most optimistic outlooks came from Deutsche Bank, which still cautioned investors not to get too
excited.
""We continue to see a better-than-even chance of tax reform (at least on the corporate side), though more limited in
scope than originally advertised,"" Joshua Feinman, chief global economist for the bank's asset management arm,
wrote in an April 17 note."
citigroup,$99M bye-bye bonus C-suite 'Berns' out," May 2, 2017",1,"Here's $99 million. Now get out.
In a surprise move that left Wall Street flummoxed, AllianceBernstein on Monday ousted Chairman and Chief
Executive Peter Kraus, who had led the firm for eight years.
Axa Financial, the French insurance giant that owns the institutional money manager, also reshuffled the AB board,
axing all nine members and appointing six new ones.
The money management firm didn't provide a clear reason for the shake-up, but in securities filings it revealed that
Kraus - a former Goldman Sachs exec who led AB for eight years - was getting a $99.3 million payout.
Axa, which has a 63.8 percent stake in AB, said JPMorgan Chase alum Seth Bernstein will be replacing Kraus as
CEO. Former World Bank president Robert Zoellick was named chairman.
""In an industry that is confronting significant shifts, we need to continue transforming the business to improve the
quality of our investment solutions while delivering our services more effectively,"" Axa's Denis Duverne said in a
statement.
Analysts weren't buying Duverne's sound bites, amid signs that he had been quietly moving to replace him for at
least several weeks.
""There is little news other than the changes did not reflect strategic or financial issues - suggesting to us,
potentially personal conflict drove the sudden change,"" Citigroup analyst William Katz wrote in a note Monday.
Duverne claimed that the decision was motivated in part by it being ""eight years in a row, for Peter.""
AB, with roughly $500 million in assets under management, reported first quarter results last week and they
certainly weren't stellar. Revenue, operating income and operating margin were all down from last year.
AB's shares were also nothing to write home about - falling 5.7 percent over the past 12 months, trailing rivals.
Before too many tears are shed for Kraus, it should be noted the now-unemployed CEO will soon be getting that
$99.3 million check as Axa buys back his 4.5 percent AB stake.
It is the second time Kraus was handsomely rewarded while being shown the door. The former longtime Goldman
Sachs executive earned $30 million from Merrill Lynch after spending just three months as head of strategy there
in 2008, scoring a golden parachute right before Merrill was sold to Bank of America.
Shares of AB closed down 3.2 percent, at $22.15."
citigroup,Bush tells Post he's 'confident' of Marlins win," May 3, 2017",1,"BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. - Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said Monday he is ""confident"" his effort to buy the Miami
Marlins will succeed.
Bush, who is part of a bidding group that includes Yankees great Derek Jeter, hopes to become the exclusive
bidder for the MLB team when the auction sale is completed, he told The Post at the Milken Institute Global
Conference here.
Bush said he was ""confident"" of becoming the exclusive bidder for the Miami Marlins when speaking to The Post
Monday afternoon on the seventh floor of the Beverly Hilton.
The former governor and 2016 presidential candidate and his son were walking the hallways at the Beverly Hilton
among scores of billionaires and Wall Street power brokers when he stopped to chat about the Marlins bid.
The Bush bidding team members are ""hoping to learn sooner rather than later"" whether they become the winners,
he said.
He didn't elaborate.
Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said last Thursday that two bidding groups - including the
Bush-Jeter group - remain in competition to purchase the Marlins from Manhattan-based art dealer Jeffrey Loria.
Earlier reports that the Marlins had chosen the Bush-Jeter group proved incorrect.
Bush is competing against unsuccessful 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and his family's

BJ's Wholesale Club has hired JPMorgan to find a buyer, two sources close to the situation told The Post.
The owners of the regional chain - PE firms CVC Capital Partners and Leonard Green &Partners - hope to attract $4
billion to $4.5 billion, sources said.
The two PE firms recently scrapped plans to list the company on the public markets, partially because of how
poorly retailers are trading.
So far, no suitor is in advanced talks and the sale process is early, sources said.
Amazon has expressed interest internally in buying BJ's but is not in formal talks yet about acquiring the
Westborough, Mass., chain, a source close to the situation said.
The assignment is a coup for JPMorgan. It did not advise the PE firms in 2011 when they acquired BJ's. CVC and
Leonard Green used four banks on the 2011 acquisition: Barclays, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and Jefferies.
The highly indebted BJ's has not grown much since 2011, when CVC and Leonard Green bought the chain. At the
time of purchase, it had 190 clubs, and in the following six-plus years, the number of clubs has grown by 12
percent.
There was speculation in 2011 that CVC and Leonard Green would expand BJ's nationally. A new owner may still
see investing in expansion as a way to improve earnings.
BJ's and JPMorgan declined to comment."

the Kentucky Derby.
Citigroup's Apple analyst James Suva threw his hat into the ring Friday, covering every conceivable base. Suva
suggests the most likely options for Apple are Netflix (40 percent odds) and Disney (25 percent odds).
Citi also suggested Apple might even scoop up Elon Musk's electric-car manufacturer Tesla (5 percent odds), or
video-game makers including Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, or Take-Two Interactive (10 percent each).
Suva's odds-making is prompted by bets that the globe's most profitable company will benefit from the Trump
administration's desire for US corporations to bring cash back into the country in return for a lower tax rate.
Apple has some $257 billion in cash on its books and has not provided many clues about how it will spend it.
But some, including Citi's Suva, believe Apple could be considering a move to buy a video streaming service. The
company's business selling downloadable music and media has seen declines as consumers move to online
streaming instead.
Talk of an Apple-Disney combination has also been heating up in the past few months. The Associated Press
pointed out a merger would create the world's first trillion-dollar company.
Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told the AP in an interview published on Tuesday, ""We are looking at
every size of acquisition, so we will see how it goes going forward.""
Apple CEO Tim Cook has historically been cautious about big deals. Many thought Apple would go after Time

Justice accused Banamex of laundering millions of dollars for violent Mexican drug cartels like Los Zetas - going

Wells Fargo.
""They gave me the freedom to do my research,"" he told The Post.
Mayo has made a reputation of going after big banks. His pointed criticism of former Citigroup Chief Executive

He's also gone after JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America bigs for pocketing fat compensation packages while
their stock prices stagnated.

""With Amazon's expertise in logistics and delivery, Whole Foods could wipe out Blue Apron and all of its peers if it
wanted to,"" said David Tawil of Maglan Capital, adding that Blue Apron and Whole Foods already have overlapping
customer bases in urban and affluent areas. Blue Apron's high marketing costs have also been a concern for investors. Despite doubling its revenue to $795.4
million last year, the company still posted a net loss of $54.9 million as it poured money into logistics and
marketing.
Founded in 2012, the Soho-based company delivers ingredients and recipes that allow customers to prepare meals
at home. It's among a fast-growing segment that includes HelloFresh, Plated, Home Chef, Sun Basket and Chef'd -
all looking for more cash to expand their operations.
Green Chef, a player in the same industry, recently said it was looking to raise at least $50 million, after already
having snagged $67 million.
Blue Apron has selected Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Barclays to launch its IPO.

citigroup,No sweat equity All 34 banks pass Fed stress test," Jun 29, 2017",0,"Big banks passed the Federal Reserve's annual stress test of their financial health - and responded with a
giveaway to investors worth billions of dollars in the form of dividends and share buybacks.
The passing grades mark the first time since the Wall Street crisis of 2008 that all 34 tested firms were deemed
healthy enough to survive a major financial disaster.
The stress test, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, means banks are deemed to have
enough money to avoid a Lehman Brothers-like failure during a hypothetical meltdown.
""I'm pleased that the CCAR process has motivated all of the largest banks to achieve healthy capital levels and
most to substantially improve their capital-planning processes,"" Fed Gov. Jerome Powell said in a statement.
The one bank that stumbled this year was Capital One, which was given until the end of the year to resubmit
stronger plans. Still, the Fed conditionally approved its offer to pay out shareholders.
The biggest winners were Banco Santander, which flunked three consecutive tests, and Deutsche Bank, which
failed the past two years.
Overall, the 34 banks are holding onto $1.25 trillion in capital cushions as of the first quarter - more than double
they held in 2009.
A passing grade gives banks the flexibility to return more money to investors.
JPMorgan Chase announced a 6-cent dividend hike, to 56 cents, and $19.4 billion in stock buybacks. Bank of
America boosted its dividend by 60 percent, to 12 cents a share, with another $12 billion in share repurchases.
Citigroup announced $18.9 billion in buybacks and dividends over the next four quarters.

citigroup,Oil 'God' exits Low pump prices spur Hall to shut hedge fund," Aug 4, 2017",0,"The oil trading ""God"" has spoken - and is said to be closing down his main hedge fund because he just can't make
a profit with such low-priced oil.
Low volatility and plummeting prices in crude helped contribute to a 30 percent decline in Andy Hall's Astenbeck
Fund this year through June 30.
While the tough market in oil is bad news for uber-traders like Hall, it is great news for American motorists, for
example, who have seen low pump prices for months.
Legendary trader Hall, who earned the nickname ""God"" after earning $100 million in profits in 2008 thanks to
perfectly timed oil trades, doesn't see a quick turnaround in low crude prices on the horizon.
West Texas Intermediate crude closed Thursday at $49.03 a barrel - and except for a few days has traded below
$60 since December 2014.
It is down 8.7 percent this year.
""It looks increasingly like oil prices will be range-bound for some time to come,"" Hall wrote in a letter to investors
last month, a copy of which was obtained by the Financial Times.
It is a humbling end for Hall's main fund.
In 2008, the turmoil of the financial crisis made him a king on Wall Street. And why not? He already had his own
castle in the German town of Astenbeck and 5,000 works of fine art - including Andy Warhol pieces - as proof of his
oil trading prowess.
Soon after Hall left Citigroup, he reportedly raised $1 billion in 2010 for his new hedge fund: Astenbeck Capital
Management.
But the last few years have not been quite so kind to commodities traders.
Hall's decision to cut bait comes as the hedge fund's flagship fund fell roughly 30 percent in the first half of the
year, Bloomberg first reported, citing sources.
""The exit of Andy Hall is very concerning. He is only one of many funds that no longer feel the energy market is a
good trading risk-reward value,"" David Greenberg, former New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) board member
told The Post.
""I don't expect to see huge spikes in the $100-115 range again, barring a major event in the Mideast, in which we could see a short-term spike,"" Greenberg said.
Goldman Sachs said on Wednesday that big oil companies have been able to adapt to the $50-range thanks in part
to cost-cutting.
The low prices and low volatility make it tough for traders to quickly make up for losing bets.
""In the past, you could be wrong but still trade around your position, and you could end up even,"" Greenberg said.
""Now there's a real lack of intraday volatility, which makes it harder for funds both short-term and long-term to
sustain losses in their portfolio,"" he said.
Reps for Astenbeck Capital Management declined to comment.
Hall did not respond to requests to comment."
citigroup,Banker Gone in a flash Nude drunk quits," Aug 8, 2017",1,"A powerful Swedish financier got blackout drunk at a house party and exposed his private parts to other guests -
leading him to resign as a senior adviser to Citigroup on Monday, according to reports.
Anders Borg - who was once Sweden's minister of finance - also reportedly threatened guests, groped other men
and called female revelers ""whores"" and ""sluts"" during his night of debauchery, a source told the Swedish tabloid
Aftonbladet.
Borg's antics were so alarming that Swedish police are reportedly investigating him for sexual harassment and
making threats - and the 49-year-old money man issued a groveling mea culpa in which he claimed he was under
extreme ""pressure.""
""I have been told afterwards that I behaved very inappropriately,"" he said in a Facebook post. ""I sincerely apologize
to all who were affected . . . I don't drink more than most people but I have been under a lot of pressure lately.""
The exec allegedly launched into his rant after he was asked by the host of the bash to sleep in another home
nearby, on the tiny Swedish island of Husaro, Aftonbladet reported.
There were about 50 people at the bawdy bash, which took place sometime in late July, according to the Financial
Times.
Borg was hired by Citigroup in 2015 following his eight-year tenure at Sweden's Finance Ministry as a senior
adviser focusing on Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
On Sunday night, he also stepped down as deputy chairman of technology investment firm Kinnevik. He said he was so hammered he couldn't remember what happened at the party.
""In a situation with a great deal of attention in the media, I choose to leave my mission as Vice-Chairman of the
board of directors of the Kinneviks and board member,"" he wrote in the Facebook post.
Borg - who insisted he did nothing wrong - later explained the apology was ""about me being rude"" and ""not to be
interpreted as a recognition of crime.""
He is the chairman of an initiative on global finance at the World Economic Forum, which did not return an e-mail
seeking comment.
The banker was blasted Monday by a member of the same Swedish political party of which he is a member.
Anna Kinberg Batra, head of the Moderate Party, called the claims against Borg ""very serious"" and publicly
welcomed the police investigation, according to the Financial Times."

Place, a historic red-brick home located on a cul-de-sac between East 86th and 87th streets, the sources said.
It's unclear whether she left a note.
A man who said that Jacoby was his daughter screamed in ""agony"" after finding out what had happened,
according to two passers-by.
""It was really harrowing. He screamed and screamed. We thought he was having a heart attack. He came out of the
building and said to call 911. But he was clutching his heart,"" said a man who identified himself only as Jeffrey.
""It wasn't until the police showed up that we realized it was a suicide.""

Jacoby and her husband, Seth (pictured inset), purchased the one-family home in 2014 for $3.6 million, taking out
a $2.5 million mortgage, according to public records.
The couple has two young children.
She previously worked in internal recruiting positions at Oppenheimer and Co., JPMorgan and Citigroup, and
served as the CEO and president at her own firm, Jacoby Staffing. She graduated cum laude from Union College in Schenectady and studied for a year in Osaka, Japan, according to
her LinkedIn page.
Henderson Place was closed off Monday pending an investigation.
Two women showed up crying hysterically at the corner of Henderson and East 86th Street on Monday afternoon.
""Why would she do this?"" one pal wailed.
Lindsay and Seth Jacoby were married in 2005, according to a New York Times announcement.

Spiral skyscraper by early 2018, sources told The Post. The signing would pave the way for a summer
groundbreaking.
We first reported last Friday that the pharmaceutical giant had chosen the Bjarke Ingels-designed, 2.8 millionsquare-
foot tower at 509 W. 34th St. for its new Manhattan headquarters - capping a search that was one of the
city's most closely watched real estate scenarios.
It's not yet a done deal. Many fine points remain to be worked out. But sources say that if all goes well, Pfizer
hopes to move in by the second half of 2022.
The deal would still leave Tishman Speyer with 2 million square feet to rent in the tower, but Pfizer's anchor-tenant
commitment will get the project out of the ground, sources said.
Pfizer also took a good, hard look at other major new projects around town, including Related Cos.' 50 Hudson
Yards (across the street from the Spiral) and SL Green's One Vanderbilt (next to Grand Central Terminal).
It sent the developers a formal request for proposals in April, we're told. Pfizer plans to sell its East 42nd Street
building, as has been widely reported.
Pfizer's mega-move also marks a milestone for the Hudson Yards District west of Eighth Avenue, a former
backwater that was rezoned by former Mayor Bloomberg to spur large-scale redevelopment. The Spiral will be the first new office skyscraper in the area to be put up by a developer other than Related or
Brookfield Property Partners (at Manhattan West) on their respective 26- and 7-acre rail-yard sites.
Tishman Speyer bought the land for The Spiral in 2014 from several other owners for $438 million and later
snatched up more air rights for an additional $108 million. It announced a partnership in The Spiral with China's
HNA Property Group last April.
Tishman Speyer owns more than 165 million square feet of commercial space around the world, including 23
million square feet in New York, where its holdings include Rockefeller Center, the Chrysler Building and the
MetLife Building.
Led since 2008 by President and co-CEO Rob Speyer, the company now has more than 8 million square feet of
projects in the development pipeline - perhaps its most ever at the same time.
Among them is a full-scale transformation of nearly six aces of mostly vacant former industrial space in Long
Island City's Queens Plaza district that will consist of two adjacent, mixed-used projects.
The Jacx will be the borough's largest office development since the Citigroup tower opened in 1990. Two 26-story
towers, connected by a four-story base, will have 1.2 million square feet, of which more than 70 percent is preleased
to WeWork and Macy's/Bloomingdale's.
Across the street, work is nearly done on Jackson Park, a trio of high-rise luxury rental apartment towers with a
private park.
Tishman Speyer has also started on The Wheeler, a 10-story, 620,000-square-foot ""creative office hub"" to rise atop
Macy's department store in downtown Brooklyn.
It also plans a new apartment tower on a former Macy's garage site across the street.
The developer is also weighing plans for another tower of up to 1.3 million square feet on a site it owns between
the new Hudson Boulevard and the Javits Convention Center between West 36th and 37th streets.
Reps for Tishman Speyer declined to comment on the Pfizer situation. A rep for Pfizer said, ""We're still in the
process and we expect to announce something either at the end of this year or the beginning of 2018."""

citigroup,"Feeling the heat Pressured, Equifax backs away from no-sue edict"," Sep 9, 2017",0,"Under extreme pressure on Friday, embattled Equifax folded on its ""no-sue"" demands.
The credit-monitoring company, which revealed on Thursday a massive cyberattack on its national database, took
heat from a host of elected officials for offering to help victims of the attack - but only if they gave up their right to
sue the Atlanta company.
Equifax said personal information, including Social Security numbers, on up to 143 million Americans were stolen
in the May cyberattack.
The company, which said it discovered the hack in July, set up a special site to offer free credit monitoring to
victims of the attack.
It is offering the service, called TrustedID, for a year.
But buried in the fine print of the site - and on a page that wasn't immediately obvious - was an agreement that
customers would ""resolve all disputes"" through ""binding individual arbitration.""
In other words, if you get any help, you can't sue us.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who's backed a government rule that would limit arbitration, tore into Equifax on
Twitter.
""@Equifax is forcing you to give up your right to join a class action against the company if you want their credit
protection product,"" Warren wrote. ""That's right: @Equifax fails to protect your data and then they demand you give
up legal rights if you want to limit the damage they caused.""
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman separately opened an investigation into how the hack happened,
and claimed that 8 million New Yorkers could be affected.
The pressure seemed to have worked on Equifax.
On Friday afternoon, the company quietly added to its Web site an FAQ that says its arbitration agreement applies
only to TrustedID, and not the cyberbreach.
The hack appears to be one of the largest ever in history. The scope of the data that have been accessed - which
include birth dates, addresses, credit card numbers and driver's license numbers - has the potential to ruin people's
credit and lead to a large scale of identity theft.
While Equifax claims that it is beefing up its cybersecurity, it also blamed the breach on a software flaw from a
vendor.
Hackers were able to breach the company through a flaw in software created by the company Apache, Equifax
said, according to Jeffrey Meuler, an analyst at Robert W. Baird, who said he was told as much in a phone call.
""My understanding is the breach was perpetuated via the Apache STRUTS flaw,"" Meuler told The Post.
STRUTS is a widely available software system that's used by many of the nation's largest companies, including
Lockheed Martin, Citigroup, Vodafone, Virgin Atlantic, Reader's Digest, Office Depot and Showtime - plus the IRS,
according to lgtm, a software development group.
Equifax has not publicly said how the cyberattack happened. STRUTS has been under attack by hackers since
March, according to Ars Technica, which has reported on the software's vulnerability. Apache has put out several patches - or software fixes - for its STRUTS system since March. It's unclear if the
company had patched its systems since then.
Equifax shares tumbled 13.7 percent on Friday, to $123.23.
Representatives for Equifax and Apache weren't immediately available for comment."
citigroup,Wall street blues Goldman revamps," Sep 13, 2017",1,"Goldman Sachs has a plan to fix its slumping trading business - just give it three years.
That was the clunker of a pitch Tuesday from a top Goldman exec, who said the Wall Street giant aims to boost its
revenue by $5 billion, or roughly 17 percent, by 2020 - even as its trading operation weathers a mercilessly
stagnant market for bonds, currencies and commodities.
Touting plans to hire more traders and woo corporate clients, co-chief operating officer Harvey Schwartz
nevertheless warned investors on getting their hopes too high before the end of the three-year period, saying that
trading since July has ""felt a lot like the first and second quarters.""
Goldman Sachs isn't the only bank that has been dogged by lackluster trading profits this year.
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned separately on Tuesday that his bank's trading revenue was poised to
plummet 20 percent in the current quarter.
Echoing comments from Citigroup CFO John Gerspach - who said Monday his bank's trading would be off by about
15 percent - Dimon warned that trading has been especially light versus last year, when it was goosed by volatility
related to Brexit and the US presidential election season.
At a Tuesday conference hosted by Barclays, Goldman's Schwartz said the bank aims to increase revenue in the
longer term by hiring more trading talent and winning corporate clients in commodities and currencies.
Looking to shrink its reliance on the troubled hedge fund sector, Goldman is likewise expanding lending across the
firm, including to smaller clients of its Marcus consumer loan and deposit business, to corporate clients and to
private wealth management clients.
Still, the hotly anticipated turnaround plan - which Goldman made public after drawing criticism for a 40 percent
plunge in trading revenue it suffered during the second quarter - failed to convince some analysts.
""Goldman's growth strategy is focused on penetrating new markets or client segments outside of the company's
traditional strengths, so we are somewhat skeptical of the management's ability to hit these revenue targets,"" KBW
analyst Brian Kleinhanzl wrote in a note. Goldman hopes to add $1 billion in revenue from the trading business by increasing the number of traders and
more aggressively pursuing new customers, according to Schwartz.
The other $4 billion in revenue will come from lending to companies and consumers, asset management,
investment banking and stock trading, he said.
The bank already doubled its level of hiring, and sales and trading now make up 43 percent of its fixed income,
currencies and commodities business, according to a Tuesday presentation."
citigroup,Swank banks shrank Q3 trading flops," Oct 13, 2017",0,"Wall Street took its lumps on Thursday after two large banks reported weak third-quarter trading.
The results from JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup spooked investors and siphoned off value from each of the large
banks.
JPMorgan, the largest US bank, saw a huge 27 percent drop in bond trading revenue, to $3.1 billion, compared with
the same period last year. That's worse than a slump of about 20 percent that Dimon had signaled at a conference
a month ago.
Overall, the bank's profits rose 7 percent on higher lending, to $6.7 billion.
Citi, which has been the best-performing major bank this year, reported a more modest 11 percent decline in
trading, to $3.6 billion, with bond trading off 16 percent.
Last month, Citi financial chief John Gerspach had warned of a 15 percent trading decline.
The bank, led by CEO Michael Corbat, made up for the trading drop with a 14 percent increase in investment
banking revenue, to $1.2 billion.
Wall Street's CEOs had previously warned analysts that trading was going to be down for the three months ending
in September, as calm markets and stable interest rates quash any reasons to buy or sell.
The meh results sent JPM shares down 85 cents, to $95.99, and Citi's shares down 3.4 percent, to $72.37.
Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America each were down slightly.
Even with the tepid results, JPMorgan reported record revenue in commercial banking and in assets in its wealth
management business - signs, the bank says, of a strengthening economy.
The earnings came a day after NBC published an op-ed by Dimon calling for lowering taxes on businesses, arguing
that it would ultimately lead to more jobs and higher wages for workers.
When pressed during a morning call, Dimon declined to pledge to raise wages for his own workers if the Trump
administration cuts taxes for businesses like JPMorgan.
""Well, that's not the way to look at it,"" he said, noting that they had raised wages for lower-paid workers previously.
JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti said that the company already pays its workers competitively. ""Over time, yeah, we probably would be boosting jobs and wages more than we otherwise would have,"" Dimon
added later."

his fellow royals, a high-ranking prince has mysteriously died in a helicopter crash, according to state television.
Prince Mansour bin Muqrin, the son of former Crown Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz, was in the southern part of the
kingdom near Yemen when the aircraft went down, the Al-Ekhbariya news channel announced Sunday.
Bin Muqrin, who was deputy governor of Saudi Arabia's Asir Province, in the southern part of the kingdom, had
been touring the area with eight other government officials, who also died, the Al-Arabiya news service reported.
A short video of the prince and other passengers boarding the chopper surfaced after the news broke. The clip
shows the group of men, their white robes billowing in the wind, climbing into the aircraft.
State media did not reveal the cause of the crash.
On Saturday, it was revealed that dozens of princes, ministers and a billionaire tycoon were arrested as Bin Salman
- who was appointed the head of Saudi Arabia earlier this year - continues his attempts to consolidate his power.
His actions have been interpreted as an attempt to eliminate any trace of dissent within the ranks before the
formal transfer of power from his 81-year-old father, King Salman.
On Sunday, Saudi officials began sweeping arrests, allegedly to end longstanding corruption.
Those detained by authorities include Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a billionaire investor who owns major stakes in
companies like Twitter and Citigroup.
Bin Salman has instituted by royal decree some controversial measures to modernize the oil-rich Mediterranean
nation by allowing women the right to drive.
Meanwhile, the crash also comes just a day after Houthi rebels in Yemen allegedly launched a ballistic missile at
an airport in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, state media reported.
The missile was intercepted and destroyed, according to reports.
The attack shines light on the ways in which the war in Yemen is increasingly spilling into Saudi Arabia, since a
Saudi-led coalition began its military intervention there in 2015.
Nearly 8,000 people have been killed in the Yemeni crisis as the Saudi and US-backed government of President
Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi battles with the Houthis, who reportedly have been backed by Iran.

citigroup,"Hey, critics: Trump jump in NY tourism"," Nov 10, 2017",0,"It was the Trump slump that never was.
Critics sobbed that the sky would fall following the Nov. 8, 2016, presidential election, predicting that the stock
market would tank, ObamaCare enrollment would plummet and international tourism to the Big Apple would
shrivel.
The first two predictions have proven false, and now the number of foreign tourists traveling to New York City is
projected to jump 3.6 percent this year.
In February, doomsday prophets from NYC &Co., the city's privately run tourism agency, said international tourism
would plummet by 300,000 visitors this year due to President Trump's ""travel ban and related rhetoric.""
""The Europeans start coming to New York around Easter and continue through summer,"" NYC &Co. CEO Fred Dixon
claimed in February. ""That's when you'll see the rhetoric out of Washington really having an impact on travel.""
But the Big Apple remains the top destination of any hot spot in North and South America - with foreign tourism
expected to spike from 12.65 million visitors in 2016 to 13.1 million in 2017, according to a report issued Tuesday
by market-research firm Euromonitor International.
NYC &Co. declined to comment.
Meanwhile, major hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs predicted Wall Street doom if
Trump reached the White House.
""If Donald Trump were to win, that outcome would have been unexpected and thereby may cause a jump in the
equity-risk premium,"" Citigroup analyst Tobias Levkovich said.
A year later, the Dow Jones industrial average has rocketed nearly 25 percent from 18,329 in October 2016 to
23,461 as of Thursday. The S&P 500 has surged roughly 21 percent.
Hand-wringers also feared that ObamaCare enrollment would tank following Trump's pledges to repeal and replace
the program and his administration cutting program marketing.
But the first four days of ObamaCare open enrollment on Nov. 1-4 saw 601,462 Americans sign up on federal
exchanges, according to figures released Thursday by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
The center could not provide a direct comparison to the four-day window in 2016, but the 600,000 figure is on pace
to top the 1 million sign-ups in the first 12 enrollment days last year.

citigroup,"DOWNTOWN SPUNK Teeming with new office leases and shops, Lower Manhattan is a bright spot in a tough retail landscape"," Dec 5, 2017",1,"MORE than 15 years since 9/11, the southernmost tip of Manhattan has blossomed into the city's most cohesive
commercial, residential and recreational district.
Unlike master-planned Hudson Yards, on the rise atop a Far West Side rail yard, this transformed neighborhood -
the anachronistically named ""Financial District"" - has evolved and grown organically on the old Dutch and English
bones of Lower Manhattan.
It seems like a miracle after the carnage and devastation of Sept. 11, 2001.
But can the stirring reversal of commercial fortune continue on an upward trajectory, even as some companies
plan to leave behind large blocks of space?
""Absolutely,"" says Bruce Surry, executive vice president at CBRE. ""The market is healthy,"" Surry adds. ""We continue
to see tenants from Midtown and Midtown South relocating Downtown for economic and qualitative reasons.""
Among them: McKinsey &Company, which, as The Post first reported, plans to leave its current East 52nd Street
headquarters for 200,000 square feet at 3 World Trade Center.
New and refurbished buildings continue to draw both the TAMI (technology, advertising, media and information)
sector and more traditional tenants. Demand for prime real estate is so strong that the rent gap between office
space in Downtown and Midtown has fallen from 37 percent in 2013 to 25 percent today, the Downtown Alliance
reports.
Even so, vulnerabilities lurk in the market. Despite current low vacancy rates below 9 percent, according to both
CBRE and Cushman &Wakefield, availability - a metric that takes into account space that'll be empty within 12
months - looms between 12 and 13 percent.
Nearly 2 million square feet have yet to be leased at 1 and 3 World Trade Center.
Upcoming major departures from Downtown, Surry says, include 440,000 square feet at 55 Water St., which
Emblem Health plans to put up for sublease.
An even larger block will come to market at 7 Hanover Square, which Guardian Insurance plans to vacate and sell.
(The firm is moving to Hudson Yards and other locations outside the city.) ""That will mean a vacant 900,000-
square-foot building a year from now,"" Surry says.
Meanwhile, Citigroup is in consolidation mode and is expected to vacate all of 111 Wall St. by early 2020.
There's no pause, however, in the residential boom.
More than 62,000 residents - triple the number of Downtown's population in the year 2000 - share its historic
streets with workers in 96 million square feet of offices below Chambers Street and the Brooklyn Bridge. The once
9-to-5 ""Wall Street"" area is now a day-and-night urban playground, bracketed by proliferating waterfront amenities
and newly dense with hotels, stores, restaurants and cinemas from river to river.
At the same time, like everywhere else in Manhattan, retail malaise is evident.
Just look for the ubiquitous ""Prime Retail Space"" signs mounted in the windows of properties for lease. A blight of
large vacancies in the blocks just west of Broadway got worse when Dean &DeLuca backed out of a lease at the
Trump Organization's 40 Wall St.
Yet single examples don't always tell the whole story.
Cushman found overall Downtown retail availability holding steady since last year at 10.2 percent - a rate that's not
only lower, but much lower, than in any major Manhattan submarket. That figure is consistent despite the fact that retail inventory has swelled to 7.28 million square feet, an
astounding 2.92 millionsquarefoot jump since the end of 2014, according to the Downtown Alliance.
As expected, some of that space is at two major new shopping centers: the Westfield mall at the World Trade
Center and Brookfield Place at the former World Financial Center. But tens of thousands of square feet have also
come to market within Howard Hughes Corp.'s redesigned South Street Seaport - as well as in hotels and
apartment buildings.
The latter group includes 1 Wall St., which Harry Macklowe is converting from offices to luxury condos.
Whole Foods signed for 44,000 square feet on the landmark's Broadway side.
New street-level shops and entertainment outposts are cropping up at office addresses, too. Take L&L Holding
Co.'s 195 Broadway, home to Anthropologie and restaurant Nobu, and Fosun's 28 Liberty St., which snared cinema
Alamo Drafthouse.
The Real Estate Board of New York reported this past summer that while retail asking rents have plunged all over
Manhattan, the ""ask"" on Broadway between the Battery and Chambers Street actually rose 11 percent, to $362 per
square foot, between May 2016 to May 2017.
A recent survey by AckmanZiff Real Estate Capital Advisors similarly found lower Broadway bucking the trend -
citing a 10 percent year-over-year hike in asking rents to $414 per square foot.
The Zara store at L&L's 222 Broadway ""really gave the corridor a lift,"" says Douglas Elliman's Faith Hope Consolo.
""Finally, some fashion!"" While retail space languishes in Tribeca and Soho to the north, a Cushman &Wakefield
report found overall Downtown asking rents averaged $427 per square foot in the third quarter, up 2.2 percent from
the same quarter in 2016. Much of the jump can be attributed to the launch of expensive space at the World Trade
Center and Brookfield Place.
Consolo notes that the area, lovingly nicknamed FiDi, ""has embraced the liveworkplay trend. It's now a full-service
area with no need to ever leave."" She adds that while rents are high at marquee and waterfront locations, smaller
businesses - like fast-casual food chains and dry cleaners - ""can still find deals south of $200 a square foot"" on
parts of Fulton, Ann, Pearl and Gold streets.
Many new retailers have recently opened downtown:
Sneakeasy at 30 Wall St., Untuckit at 230 Vesey St. and Indochino at 25 Broad St.
Prime FiDi locations waiting to be filled include the former J&R storefronts along Park Row as well as cavernous
23 Wall St., which real estate broker and acquisition pro Jack Terzi has a contract to buy (if he can first sign Uniqlo
as a tenant for the former bank).
But in spite of a few shadows, the big picture remains bright - at least as long as tenants continue to grasp that the
Downtown of dark streets after 5 p.m. and on weekends is long gone."
citigroup,"Wrap us up, please Bemis hires bank"," Dec 5, 2017",1,"The pressure on packaging giant Bemis Co. to sell itself is growing both internally and externally, The Post has
learned.
Bemis, the largest US maker of flexible plastic food packaging - like bottles for Pepsi and tubes for Colgate - has
hired Goldman Sachs to explore its options, two sources close to the situation said.
The 159-year-old Neenah, Wisc., manufacturer, whose profits and revenues have slipped in recent years, is likely to
draw plenty of interest from rivals should it decide to put itself on the block, sources said.
In fact, British-based DS Smith, a maker of corrugated packaging, is working with Citigroup and is interested in
pursuing the $4.2 billion market cap Bemis, a source close to the situation said.
There were reports in September that Zurich-based Amcor Ltd., the world's largest maker of flexible plastic
packaging, was working on an offer for Bemis as it looks to expand its US operations.
Amcor is working with investment bank UBS, a source said.
Bemis last summer told shareholders it would need to sell itself in 12 months if it could not execute a turnaround,
an industry source said.
Now, six months later, the turnaround has not happened and it will be hard for the company to reject offers, the
source said.
""Results from the ongoing turnaround effort have been checkered at best,"" BMO Capital Markets said in a Nov. 15
report. ""During 2017, they cut guidance three quarters in a row and reduced long-term growth targets.""
Part of the problem for Bemis is that it's focused on the biggest food companies, and many of them have been
losing market share. Rising resin prices are also not helpful.
Meanwhile, shareholder activist Starboard Value disclosed last month it had become a top-10 Bemis holder.
""Starboard held large stakes in two chronic underperformers in our [packaging] sector, Wausau Paper and
MeadWestvaco,"" BMO said. ""In both cases, the endgame was a sale of the company.""
In the nine months ended Sept. 30, Bemis reported profits fell 23.3 percent from the previous year on flattish
revenue. Since 2014, Bemis' profits from continuing operations has been flat while revenue has dipped 8 percent
over that period.
Bemis shares are up less than 1 percent over the last two years. They closed Monday at $46.67, up 17 cents.
BMO forecast that Amcor, if it bought Bemis, could pay $60 a share.
Bemis, DS Smith and Amcor did not return calls.

citigroup,Sex-pix fix was in: prof Rips DA's stalk case," Jan 29, 2018",0,"She's baaaaack!
Three years after being accused of stalking Citigroup's top economist, a former NYU professor says in court papers
that the married financial whiz framed her with nudie photos from their ""love play"" sessions - and that Manhattan
prosecutors ignored her when she told them.
Willem Buiter, Citi's global chief economist, had shown 1,251 pornographic snaps to prosecutors with the District
Attorney's Office back in 2013 when he got his lover-turned-stalker, Heleen Mees, a fellow Dutch citizen, arrested.
Buiter, a father of two, said the snaps were nude selfies Mees sent to him in hundreds of e-mails as part of a postbreakup
harassment campaign.
Mees says in the new filing that she told prosecutors at the time that Buiter was lying but that they refused to
believe her.
She claims that she did not send him these photos of her ""private parts"" and says she now has forensic proof that
the pictures were actually snapped by Buiter himself as he watched her masturbate with sex toys during their
dozens of online trysts over Skype.
She is seeking to have a Manhattan judge force the DA's office to revisit what she is calling prosecutors'
""fraudulent"" stalking case.
Mees previously agreed to an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal (ACD) that allowed her to have the
charges tossed if she completed therapy. She completed therapy, and the charges have been dismissed, but she
wants the ACD out of her sealed file.
She says that as a result of Buiter's ""false"" and ""libelous"" allegations, she lost her job teaching economics at NYU,
has been unable to find other employment and suffers from chronic depression.
""It has been extraordinarily distressing for Mees to know that Buiter recorded their intimate love play via Skype
webcam and held onto the naked photos on his mobile devices while he was reporting her in July 2013 to the New
York Police Department and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office,"" the court papers say.
""Any naked photos of Mees in the criminal file were the product of unlawful surveillance.""
Mees' lawyer, Joshua Kirshner, declined to comment. Buiter, through a Citigroup spokesperson, also declined.
The DA's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
citigroup,Whale of a pay gap for Barclays women," Feb 23, 2018",0,"One of the biggest banks on Wall Street on Thursday has unveiled an eye-popping pay gap.
Barclays, run by Chief Executive Jes Staley, pays its female investment bankers about half of what it pays men in the same unit - underscoring the lack of women in senior positions.
On average, Barclays female investment bankers make 48 percent of what their male counterparts do, the
company said in its annual report on Thursday.
UK banks, under a new law, are required to disclose pay disparity.
The report also shows that there's a shrinking number of women in top roles, including managing directors and
board members, since last year.
Staley, in the report, said he was ""confident"" men and women got paid equally for the same job but that the bank
has to continue to push to get more women into higher-level jobs.
Staley said it was the bank's goal to increase female representation on Barclays' board from 21 percent today to 33
percent by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of associates, the lowest-level bankers, are women, while assistant vice presidents, one step up,
are only 38 percent women, the bank said.
Managing directors, the highest level, are just 15 percent female.
US banks, like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, have yet to report their data on pay. They have until April to
make the disclosures.
Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo have all reported that they pay women 99 cents for every dollar they
pay men - however, the banks haven't released their methodology, and skeptics have questioned those
proportions.

information about their relationships with presidential adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, his family and
businesses.
The Department of Financial Services sent letters to Deutsche, Signature Bank and New York Community Bank last
week, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday.
The regulators asked about the banks' relationships with Kushner and his business properties, as well as
documents and communications about certain loan requests, and set a deadline of March 5, Bloomberg reported.
The request came from Maria Vullo, an appointee of Gov. Cuomo who serves as the department's superintendent.
Kushner stepped down from the family business when he joined the administration just over a year ago and
divested some assets by transferring them to relatives.
He has been on the hot seat over his security clearance, with one area of concern being how much debt he and
wife Ivanka Trump have taken on since joining the administration.
Deutsche, Signature and New York Community are among six banks that have lent them money.
""We have not received a copy of any letter from the New York State Department of Financial Services,"" Christine
Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Kushner Cos., told Bloomberg.
Ciara Marangas, a department rep, declined to comment.
Also on Wednesday, The New York Times reported that Kushner, whose security clearance has just been
downgraded, took White House meetings last year with bigwigs from Apollo Global Management and Citigroup -
institutions that later gave loans of $184 million and $325 million, respectively, to Kushner Cos.
Reps for Kushner did not dispute that the meetings took place, but insisted he has had no role in the family

Our beloved, global-icon Midtown Manhattan skyline has been hijacked by obscenely rich global drifters. Postcardfavorite
commercial structures such as the Empire State and Chrysler buildings, 30 Rock, Citigroup and newer One
Bryant Park are humming cogs in the city's economic machine, filled with working, striving, human beings. But
they're being upstaged by loftier condo monoliths inhabited by shadows.
Make that shadow companies - like the one used to shield the identity of money-laundering Nigerian oil
magnate/playboy Kolawole ""Kola"" Aluko, who secretly owned a foreclosed 79th floor penthouse at One57 on
""Billionaires' Row.""
Shadows define the new generation of ""residential"" super-talls, but not in the way most people predicted. Fears
that cloudbusters clustered along 57th Street would cast shade on Central Park had it backwards. Viewed from
Central Park - from the Reservoir running track, for example - beanstalk ""investment vehicles"" cast a pall on
Midtown.
Some stand more than 1,000 feet tall. The under-construction ""Central Park Tower"" on West 57th Street, which

aims to sell $4 billion worth of apartments, will rise taller than One World Trade Center minus its antenna. More are
going up including 111 W. 57th St. and 53 W. 53rd St.
But aren't taller buildings and constant change what the city's all about?
I'm not upset over ""income inequality"" or that new structures stand higher than old ones. New York will always
have its very poor and very rich. I loved the Empire State Building no less when the Twin Towers went up.
But we should resent towers that are mainly designed to make their developers a killing on absentee foreign
buyers - some who buy them merely to flip later for higher prices, others who take years designing ""dream homes
in the sky"" but never move in. In one infuriating 2013 purchase, an unidentified Chinese woman grabbed a $6.5
million unit at One57 that won't be used until her daughter enters college here. The daughter was two years old at
the time of the purchase.
The upright piggy banks for sheikhs, rubber moguls and hedge-fund pirates define Midtown's new visual profile -
whether viewed from an airplane window or in an Instagram shot from across the river.
Office buildings counter-intuitively belong to us all. They ""manufacture"" everything from TV shows to exotically
packaged stocks and bonds. Their inhabitants earn money to spend on our stores, restaurants and kids'
educations. Taxes on their incomes pay for our vital services.
But doormen can die of loneliness in the rising or recently opened apartment towers. How often would reclusive
Mexican tequila mogul Juan Beckmann Vidal, who also owns pads at zillionaire-friendly Trump Tower and the
Plaza Hotel, have been ""home"" on 432 Park Ave.'s 84th floor if he hadn't pulled out of a $44.4 million deal over
flood damage?
Oligarch sanctuaries don't even have to be super-tall to ruin the skyline for the rest of us. The cookie-cutter
limestone stump of 520 Park Ave., a pygmy at 780 feet, was thrust like a weed between the Sherry-Netherland and
Pierre hotels - Jazz Age landmarks that, when viewed from east or west, played off one another like meshing
soloists. Now, 520 Park Ave. breaks into the duet like a drunk stagehand.

The Boston private-equity firm was a lead investor in three leveraged buyouts - Toys 'R' Us, iHeartMedia and Guitar
Center - each of which experienced a financial collapse in recent days.
The Mitt Romney-founded firm co-led the 2008 buyout of America's biggest radio station owner, iHeart, and on
Thursday the San Antonio, Texas, company filed for bankruptcy protection.
In 2005, Bain was a lead investor in Toys 'R' Us, which announced Thursday it was liquidating its 730 stores,
putting 33,000 jobs at risk.
And the 34-year-old PE shop was also the lead investor in 2007 in Guitar Center, the musical instrument retailer
that this week proposed a debt refinancing that, if accepted by bondholders, would be considered a default, credit
agencies said.
Bain typically buys steady, healthy companies in highly leveraged buyouts.
""They take a lot more risks than other private equity firms,"" Eileen Applebaum, co-director of the Center for
Economic and Policy Research in Washington, DC, told The Post, referring to pushing the envelope on the amount
of debt they put on their companies.
Twenty-two percent of Bain LBOs from 1984 to 1992 went bankrupt, Applebaum wrote in her book, ""Private Equity
at Work."" That is a far higher percentage than the industry average, according to the book. It happened under
previous leadership.
Boston Celtics owner Stephen Pagliuca and Josh Bekenstein now lead Bain.
The $26 billion iHeart buyout seemed a stretch, even at the time.
Bain, and Thomas H. Lee Partners first agreed to buy iHeart, then called Clear Channel, in 2007.
But as the deal was set to close, the Great Recession began.
Lenders financing the buyout - including Citigroup and Morgan Stanley - moved to terminate the deal.
Bain and THL took the lenders to court and forced the buyout to be completed.
The owners collected about $43 million each in transaction fees from their fund investors for completing the deal.

An iHeart creditor said he believes that iHeart will improve its operating earnings post-bankruptcy - by about 10
percent over the next two years - as the cash that was being used to pay down debt can now be used to invest in
digital initiatives.
Of course, not every Bain LBO from the go-go 2006 to 2008 period is crashing.
The PE firm bought both Burlington Coat Factory and HCA Healthcare during that stretch - and both are performing
well.
The Boston firm last year raised a $9.4 billion North American buyout fund so it will not need more money for at
least a few years.

citigroup,"Meredith hires bankers to sell SI, Time, others"," Mar 16, 2018",1,"The long-anticipated downsizing at Meredith - including the spinoffs of unwanted titles - is finally starting to
happen.
Speculation surrounding the likely sale of Time, Fortune, Money and Sports Illustrated is swirling as folks inside
and outside the company wonder which suitors will step up to the plate. Citigroup and Houlihan Lokey have been retained to find buyers for the four titles officially going on the block,
according to a report in Reuters on Thursday, which cited sources ""familiar with the situation.""
Staffers at Entertainment Weekly can breathe easier - they're not going anywhere after their recent cross-country
migration from New York to new digs in Los Angeles.
The names of possible suitors on the lips of industry experts include former Time Inc. Chief Executive Joe Ripp
and Jay Penske, head of Penske Media Corp.
PMC bought Rolling Stone and the Robb Report to add to digital titles such as Women's Wear Daily.
American Media Inc. has expressed interest in buying some of the titles in the past, but sources say the company
is tapped out financially after stretching to buy Us Weekly and Men's Journal last year.
""They may look, but I am not sure they'll end up as the buyer,"" said Reed Phillips, an investment banker at Oaklins
DeSilva+Phillips.
""It won't be easy to find a strategic buyer,"" Phillips added. ""I think it will be more likely to go the way newspapers
have gone lately and get sold to wealthy individuals.""
Telecom and tech companies may also take a look, sources said.
In addition to the sale of the four titles, Meredith is likely to undertake other belt-tightening moves.
Those are expected to be unveiled next week after an ""integration study"" by Deloitte Consulting is complete.
Between the downsizing and title sales, hundreds of jobs will be cut - in addition to the 600 to 700 positions
already getting the heave-ho from the Time Customer Service Center in Tampa, Fla., which is being shut down.
Hearst-owned CDS will take over subscription processing and billing.
As for Entertainment Weekly, initially there was speculation that it would be added to the other four titles in the
out-box - but Jess Cagle, the editorial director of People and EW, was said to have made an impassioned pitch to
Executive Chairman Steve Lacy and Chief Executive Tom Harty, his new bosses, to keep the magazines in the
Meredith stable.
Cagle, who was skipped over as the red carpet host for the Oscar pre-show on ABC this year, is said to be keenly
interested in developing TV projects and doing high-profile interviews.
Cagle already has a home out West, and over the Memorial Day weekend is getting married to LA-based TV
producer Matt Whitney.
Dan Wakeford, onetime editor of In Touch, is involved in putting together much of the print edition of People in New
York.
Meredith has told Wall Street investors that the $2.8 billion deal finalized Jan. 31 can be justified because it plans
to realize $400 million to $500 million in cost savings over the next two years. But the cuts could be deeper than first anticipated, sources said, because numbers in the first quarter of the year
are off.
Separately, the prestigious Henry Luce Award, named for the man who cofounded Time Inc. in 1922, is going to be
renamed the Meredith Achievement Award, one source said.

demands of our audience.""
Tronc CEO Michael Ferro picked up the struggling tabloid for a mere $1 in September.
But even with a rock-bottom paywall price - 99 cents for a 13-week introductory period, or just over 4 cents a week,
and $1.99 for each week after that - traffic is down sharply.
Page views in February plummeted a staggering 45 percent over the same month last year, according to
comScore, to 109 million, down from 197 million.
The number of unique visitors dropped just 12 percent, to 25.9 million, in February, according to comScore.
The drop in uniques is less severe than the drop in page views because under the pay wall plan, visitors get to read
10 free stories a month - and home delivery subscribers get free access."
citigroup,A Fortune hunter Bloomberg eyes magazine: source," Mar 21, 2018",1,"Bloomberg LP is among potential acquirers that have circled Fortune magazine, The Post has learned.
A deal to sell the storied financial title - founded by Henry Luce in 1929 - could come in the next few weeks,
according to one source.
Others, however, cautioned a quick sale was not guaranteed - saying talks were fluid.
Meredith, the publisher of Better Homes and Gardens, has put Fortune, Time, Money and Sports Illustrated on the
block after it acquired them with its $1.84 billion purchase of Time Inc.
Meredith recently hired Citigroup and Houlihan Lokey to explore the sale of the titles.
Potential suitors for the magazines have included former Time Inc. Chief Executive Joe Ripp; Jay Penske, head of
Penske Media, which owns Variety and Women's Wear Daily; as well as venture capitalists and individual investors.
A Bloomberg spokesman declined to comment on any possible talks with the Des Moines, Iowa, publisher.
Meredith said its policy is ""not to comment on market rumors or speculation.""
Despite the buzz about Bloomberg, insiders wondered how Fortune would fit into Bloomberg's print portfolio,
which includes rival Bloomberg Businessweek and Bloomberg Markets.
Acquiring Fortune could help eliminate a rival with a strong brand, one source mused. Perhaps best known for its
Fortune 500 franchise, the magazine also hosts profitable live events such as the ""Most Powerful Women Summit""
and ""Fortune Global Forum.""
Fortune and Money, a sister title, rang up more than $20 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization last year.
Bloomberg bought Businessweek from McGraw-Hill in 2009 for between $2 million and $5 million in cash - plus the
assumption of an undisclosed amount of debt.
Although Bloomberg has helped revive the title, it has gone through its fair share of editorial shake-ups and
redesigns."
citigroup,Occupy Vault Street," Mar 22, 2018",1,"JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon makes 364 times what the median employee at his bank does,
putting him near the top among Wall Street honchos, according to a new pay study.
The ratio at major banks is higher only at Citigroup, where Michael Corbat makes 369 times what the median
employee makes, according to their proxy.
The bank paid Dimon, a billionaire, $28.3 million last year, including benefits, while the median employee made
$77,799 including health care and retirement benefits, according to a proxy filing released Wednesday.
The bank's figure for Dimon's pay is lower than the $29.5 million it proposed earlier this year - a sweetened
package that is expected to get approved by shareholders later this year.
Wells Fargo said last week CEO Tim Sloan made 291 times the average employee at his bank."
