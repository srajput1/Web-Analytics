6-Mar-18,30.69,30.82,30.08,30.125,25633335,bank of america,"Here's one bank bigwig who seems to be feeling the heat.
On Thursday, Wells Fargo Chief Executive Tim Sloan blasted months-old comments from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (DMass.)
and defended a 35 percent pay raise for his work in 2017 - even as major investors are weighing whether to
block his compensation.
Sloan, whose bank underperformed all but one rival in 2017, defended a proposed $17.5 million pay package for his
work last year - when the bank was rocked by additional sales scandals and the Federal Reserve took an
unprecedented step to limit its growth.
Sloan also went out of his way to slam Warren, a frequent critic of Wall Street, for her comments five months ago
that he should resign.
""It's not surprising I disagree with almost everything Elizabeth Warren says,"" he told reporters in Detroit, according
to Reuters. ""Most of her comments are both ill-informed and inappropriate.""
New York state Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli is not a fan of the plan to give Sloan a raise.
""Given Wells Fargo's multiple scandals and governance failures, a pay cut would be more deserving than a raise,""
DiNapoli said in a statement.
Sloan's complaints come as shareholders of the embattled bank are considering blocking his compensation when
they vote next month at Wells' annual meeting.
New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who controls the city's pension, which owns more than $600 million in
Wells Fargo shares, is weighing a vote against Sloan's comp, a spokesman told The Post.
Last year's shareholder meeting was an extended circus of angry shareholders who demanded the board resign in
the wake of the fake-accounts scandal the previous fall.
Wells Fargo opened at least 3.5 million bogus accounts in order to pad its bottom line.
The scandal led to the resignation of its then-CEO John Stumpf and brought to light a host of other shady sales
practices, including forced auto insurance and hiking prices on mortgages.
""This is a consequence of when you run essentially a mob operation,"" Bruce Marks, CEO of the Neighborhood
Assistance Corporation of America, told The Post. ""The don gets paid very well."" Marks, who was thrown out of last year's meeting for refusing to stop speaking , said he plans on rallying other
investors to block Sloan's pay package.",0
6-Mar-18,31.44,31.49,30.42,30.55,110271917,bank of america,"Big Six - the Sixth Avenue/Rockefeller Center submarket - is king of Manhattan office leasing for the second year in
a row. If dry statistics make you doze off, a short stroll along the teeming boulevard should perk you up like a dose
of Adderall.
Retail and residential energy are palpable from Franklin Street to Central Park South, but Sixth Avenue's marquee
drag runs from 40th to 59th streets - home to major hotels, Radio City Music Hall and the grand sweep of office
towers lovingly shown at the beginning of Woody Allen's ""Manhattan.""
That panorama, shot in 1979, looks very incomplete today, lacking One Bryant Park and other new skyscrapers. Cushman &Wakefield data cited by the Avenue of the Americas Association show that for all of 2017, Sixth Avenue
leasing outpaced any other major Manhattan avenue or cross-street - a total 3.27 million square feet, up nearly 42
percent from 2.31 million square feet in 2016.
By comparison, the second-highest leasing volume was recorded on Tenth Avenue, which saw 1.66 million square
feet - the bulk of it in new and redesigned buildings at Related Companies/Oxford's Hudson Yards and at
Brookfield's Manhattan West.
In the Sixth Avenue/Rock Center district's 41 million square feet - a total second only to the Grand Central District's
43.5 million square feet - overall vacancy in the fourth quarter of 2017 fell to 9.6 percent from 10 percent a year
earlier. Average asking rents were a solid $85.36. Class-A ""asks"" were $86.68.
The narrow difference between the overall ask and the class-A ask reflects a simple fact that defines Sixth Avenue:
Nearly all its office space is Class A. (By comparison, according to Cushman, the average ask for all of Midtown
was $76.94 for the fourth quarter, versus $83.57 for Class-A space - a gap reflecting a much higher volume of older,
obsolescent space than exists along Sixth Avenue.
Among 2017's largest new leases: Mizuho Americas added 270,000 square feet at 1271 Sixth, the former Time
&Life building, on top of 141,000 it took there earlier in the year.
Bank of America committed to leasing the HBO Building's entire 366,000 square feet at 42nd Street when HBO
moves out. Deloitte grabbed 98,000 square feet at Rockefeller Group's 1221 Sixth Ave. while keeping its 430,000-
square-foot headquarters at Tishman Speyer's 30 Rock.
Monster renewals were led by AllianceBernstein's 992,000 square feet at Fisher Brothers' 1345 Sixth Ave.,
Cushman found. The largest renewal-plus-expansion deal was by 21st Century Fox, with more than 790,000 square
feet at Ivanhoé Cambridge and Callahan Capital Partners' 1211 Sixth Ave.
Sixth Avenue stands apart from neighboring subdistricts in several ways. Times Square's 2000-era quartet at 42nd
Street is younger and more modern, but swamped by hordes of costumed Elmos and tourists.
Although many Sixth Avenue towers date from the 1970s and '80s, they're more modern than many in East
Midtown. The once-premier zone north of Grand Central is finally on the mend thanks to recent rezoning and to
three great, rising projects - One Vanderbilt, 390 Madison Ave. and 425 Park Ave.
To stay competitive, Sixth Avenue landlords are collectively spending hundreds of millions of dollars on new
infrastructure, lobbies and public amenities.",0

freshman year ... I shoulda played a lot more. I was frustrated at times, but I still stayed the course. I stayed
believing in God, having faith in God.
""Even last year, when I got hurt, I was so devastated I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was mad 'cause that
summer before I put in so much hard work getting ready for the season and I felt like all that went to waste when I
got injured and I couldn't play. So for the first couple of months I was really sad, but with the help of my family,
they really taught me just keep faith in God and now look at me, I'm a champion now. So I feel like everything
happens for a reason."" But some things that happen, you struggle force you to struggle to find a reason.

was a freshman at Teaneck High School. Hernandez will carry the memory of his godfather to Dayton with him.

6-Mar-18,32.06,32.2,31.88,31.98,44784462,bank of america,"Congratulations, ABC. You did it.
After delivering one of the most controversial ""Bachelor"" finales in franchise history - in which star Arie Luyendyk
Jr. blindsided fiancée Becca Kufrin, dumping her in a 30-minute span of raw, unedited footage - America's Network sunk to a new low in order to deliver season-high ratings.
Bravo, Mike Fleiss, for producing this mess. Are you making room in your bank account for a big bonus check?
At the end of every season, Bachelor Nation is promised the ""most dramatic"" conclusion ever from host Chris
Harrison.
And while the ""Bachelor"" brain trust certainly delivered Monday night, it was at the cost of nauseating a fan base.
We're used to brutal breakups and cringe-worthy confrontations.
Who could forget Season 13's Jason Mesnick ending his engagement to Melissa Rycroft as the cameras rolled
during the ""After the Final Rose"" special in 2009? But capturing the tense final moments between Luyendyk and
Kufrin crossed a line.
Don't get me wrong - fans of reality TV love a juicy storyline.
Heck, it was hard to give up watching Bravo's ""Vanderpump Rules"" in real time this year once the ""Bachelor""
premiered in January. But following the elimination of a vapid villainy midway through the competition, Luyendyk's
already snooze-worthy season lost even more luster.
As the final weeks approached, rumors surfaced Luyendyk would jilt his final pick in favor of the runner up. And
with ABC promoting a five-hour, two-night event ahead of Monday night's season finale, it was apparent fans were
in for a treat.
What they received, however, was something else entirely.
With a crew documenting Luyendyk breaking Kufrin's heart, viewers didn't miss a sigh or tear - thanks in part to
dual screens, which eliminated tiresome camera pans.
Though nothing is sacred where reality TV is concerned, watching someone get their future ripped away for the
sake of salvaging a lost season is not only doing a disservice to an already embattled franchise - looking to move
forward following a summer scandal with ""Bachelor in Paradise"" - but to loyal viewers as well.
Bachelor Nation may not root for everyone on the show, but Kufrin was a fan favorite going into the finale, and
audiences did not want to see someone they connected with get hurt. And while she may have signed her life away
by joining the show, she didn't ask for her personal heartache to become an embarrassing primetime spectacle,
either.
For a franchise that's long been criticized for manipulating contestants in the hopes of delivering real drama, this
ratings ploy feels like a low blow for a show that prides itself on creating a modern-day fairy tale.
And while some love stories don't always have happy endings - as audiences have seen with ""Bachelor"" couples
time and time again - the same can be said for TV shows that disgust their viewers one too many times.",1
6-Mar-18,32.13,32.22,31.68,31.98,57363195,bank of america,"Amazon may soon find yet another way into its customers' wallets.
The e-commerce behemoth is reportedly chatting with big banks about creating a ""checking account-like product""
for its customers.
Details on the effort are scarce, but the talks hint that there is no industry that Amazon isn't willing to disrupt.
Fresh off its acquisition of Whole Foods in August, Amazon has made moves to build its own delivery service that
would rival United Parcel Service and FedEx. Amazon is also weighing entering the health and prescription- drugs
business.
By offering its own checking-account product - or partnering with a bank to offer one - Amazon could minimize transaction fees on its platform.
Amazon's talks with the big banks, which include JPMorgan Chase, are in the early stages. It is possible the
product may never see the light of day, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news.
Capital One Financial has also pitched Amazon on a possible checking account product, the WSJ reported.
""As a matter of practice, we don't comment on market rumor or speculation,"" a spokesperson from Capital One told
The Post.
Reps from Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. JPMorgan declined to comment.
It wouldn't be Amazon' s first foray into the financial sphere. Seven years ago, Amazon launched a lending program
for small businesses that sell on the platform.
Amazon also has a working history with JPMorgan.
Last month, Amazon and the banking giant revealed they are working with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway to
create a company that will lower health-care costs for employees at all three companies.",1
6-Mar-18,32.11,32.57,32.08,32.17,83447552,bank of america,"After a 10-year quest for a new headquarters tower, JPMorgan Chase is set to replace antiquated 270 Park Ave.
with a much taller and larger skyscraper.
But it's been a long, strange trip for the nation's largest bank, which found itself frustrated several times trying to
establish a new home - illustrating how difficult it is for a huge company with highly specialized needs.
JPMorgan Chase didn't want to leave 270 Park Ave. Jamie Dimon's troops love being close to Grand Central
Terminal, through which many of its top-paid execs and traders pass daily.
The old building, opened in 1959, was designed for an age when Xerox copier machines were the last word in
technology. But under old East Midtown zoning, JPM couldn't replace 270 Park with a new structure even of the
same size.
JPM occupies all or part of 14 buildings in the city, covering nearly 6.5 million square feet in Manhattan - mostly at
245, 270 and 277 Park Ave., 383 Madison Ave. and 28 Liberty St. (the former Chase Plaza, now owned by China's
Fosun.) Not one of them is suitable for JPMorgan's headquarters and trading needs.
""This isn't the 1980s,"" said a real estate dealmaker attuned to the bank's thinking. ""Financial companies of Chase's
size and complexity can't just refurbish a dinosaur and say, 'We can squeeze in a little more fiber-optic cable.' They
need to design their own electronics, sustainability features and redundant systems, which you can only fully do in
a new building.""
The breakthrough came with the rezoning of East Midtown last year. The complicated new rules basically allow
larger new towers to go up in exchange for developers' payments to the city for transit and public-area
improvements.
But before new zoning kicked in, JPM - pressured by competition from Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and other
institutions working out of newer quarters with superior infrastructure - exhausted every option hunting for a
different location.
The first serious try was at 130 Liberty St., the former Deutsche Bank building just south of Ground Zero that was
ruined on 9/11 - but still standing when Dimon announced plans for a new tower there in 2007.
The bank was to pay the Port Authority $290 million for a 99-year ground lease. The tower would have 42 stories
and room for 7,000 employees. ""We're proud of going back home,"" Dimon said - referring to JPM's downtown roots.
To preserve a parcel of ground to be used for a new St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church - a pet project of former
Gov. George Pataki - architect Gene Kohn of Kohn Pedersen Fox had to cantilever six trading floors above the church site.
The protruding floors quickly caused the design to be dubbed the ""beer-belly tower"" in The Post. Kohn said he
might slim the ""midriff bulge."" But a thornier problem was that the PA and the Lower Manhattan Development
Corp. couldn't take down 130 Liberty St. after a fatal fire in August 2007 brought demolition to a halt.
As JPM honchos grew antsy over the delay, they caught a break in early 2008 when they picked up the remains of
Bear Stearns in a $237 million fire sale - including the collapsed investment bank's 383 Madison Ave.
headquarters, a relatively modern structure equipped with the needed trading floors.
It appeared to solve at least some of JPM's problems, so the bank dropped its 130 Liberty St. plan. But even
newish buildings grow old quickly in the digital age. Dimon gradually discovered that 383's trading floors weren't
getting it done the way trading floors were doing for BofA at One Bryant Park.
In the summer of 2013, Dimon sold downtown's Chase Plaza - part of a reevaluation of the bank's real estate
needs, which once again included the search for a new HQ.
Dimon ""kicked tires"" at Brookfield's Manhattan West and Vornado's Pennsylvania Hotel site. He also considered
relocating its trading operations to Stamford, Conn., where UBS was planning to unload on the cheap the world's
largest trading floor - 100,000 square feet
Although a bank rep told The Post in 2014, ""No decision has yet been made to move from 270 Park,"" Dimon settled
on a destination: two new skyscrapers planned at Related Companies' Hudson Yards. One would be an 1,100-foottall
giant at 504-522 W. 34th St., where Coach Inc. owned the land but would sell it to Related once Coach moved
to its own new digs at 10 Hudson Yards. The second would be at the rising structure now known as 50 Hudson
Yards, future home of BlackRock.
But City Hall balked at JPM's request for $1 billion in subsidies for the $6.5 billion development. The proposal died
in October 2014. Afterward, speculation ran rampant about Dimon's intentions.
Some scenarios seemed far-fetched. In December 2016, the Wall Street Journal reported that SL Green, which was
about to start work on One Vanderbilt, had offered the exasperated bank a swap - it would give JPM the new
skyscraper in exchange for 270 Park Ave. and 383 Madison Ave.
But Dimon patiently waited out the rezoning. The terms worked out by former Planning Commissioner Carl
Weisbrod and his successor, Marisa Lago, incorporating input from area ""stakeholders,"" at last gave JPM the
flexibility it needed.
The new tower will stretch 500 feet closer to heaven than its current HQ. No architect has yet been chosen. The
bank is gobbling up air rights from neighboring sites and hopes to begin demolition early next year.
Some architects and preservation groups are howling for retroactive landmark status for 270 Park Ave. - which the
city's Landmarks Preservation Commission declined to do in the past. Such a step would sabotage the project for
good. But with any luck, and if reason prevails, Dimon will finally get to build the trophy that's eluded him for 10
long years.
n A new tenant is coming to Fisher Brothers' 299 Park Ave. - Traxys Group, which signed for 29,771 square feet.
Traxys, a commodity trader-merchant in metals and natural resources, will move next year from 825 Third Ave.
The signing brings 299 Park Ave. to 85 percent leased.
The tower will begin a major capital improvement program this year.
A CBRE team repped Traxys. Newmark Knight Frank and a Fisher Brothers in-house team repped the landlord.",1

The corporate exodus began late Thursday, when First National Bank of Omaha promised to stop issuing NRA Visa
cards and Enterprise Holdings said it would end discounts for NRA members. Enterprise Holdings owns the
Enterprise, Alamo and National car-rental companies.
By Friday, Hertz, Avis and Budget had also stopped discounts, as did the Best Western hotel chain and Symantec

The NRA on Saturday accused defectors of ""a shameful display of political and civic cowardice,"" and said the loss
of a discount ""will neither scare nor distract one single NRA member.""
Additional NRA breakups may be in the offing.

Florence Gould, the ""Queen of the Riviera,"" was a flapper fashion plate and a Depression-era trend-setter who
parlayed her husband's inherited fortune into a chain of casino pleasure palaces throughout France. American by
birth but French to the tips of her manicured fingers, the green-eyed beauty cultivated a vast network of friends
and lovers that included some of the biggest names of her day, including Charlie Chaplin, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Coco
Chanel and Maurice Chevalier.
She was also a blithe Nazi collaborator who tried to launder ill-gotten wealth for Hitler's regime and ran a Paris
prostitution ring to pleasure German occupiers during World War II. She added ""ownerless"" art masterpieces
confiscated from Jewish connoisseurs to her exquisite art collection. And after the Third Reich's defeat, Gould's
status helped absolve her war crimes - as the international jet set politely looked the other way.
In her new book ""A Dangerous Woman"" (St. Martin's Press), out now, Susan Ronald traces Gould's amoral life and
high-flying times.
Born in San Francisco in 1895 to French immigrant parents, Florence Lacaze fled the West Coast with her mother
and younger sister after the 1906 earthquake leveled the city by the Bay. They settled in Paris to live in genteel
poverty, leaving Florence's newspaper-editor father behind.
She grew up coveting a place in the salons of Paris, regular gatherings of artists and writers ruled by the city's
wealthiest, wittiest women. In 1918, as a scantily clad chorus girl in the famous Folies Bergère, she schemed to
reel in a rich husband who would help her join that upper crust.
Enter Frank Jay Gould, youngest son of American robber baron Jay Gould, whose share of his family's estate would
be worth about $4 billion today. When they wed in 1923, they agreed that neither would give up their extracurricular sexual dalliances, forming an
early open marriage. ""Everybody slept with everybody else,"" Florence Gould would say decades later. ""It was fun. It
was practical.""
As business partners, they launched a hotel and casino after spending a winter on the French Riviera. The Goulds
chose the sleepy village of Juan-les-Pins, located between Cannes and Monte Carlo on the Mediterranean coast.
The Hotel Provencale, a lavish 256-bedroom Art Deco palace, immediately drew a chic crowd of entertainers,
artists and writers. Rudolph Valentino, Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Mary
Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks all gambled and lounged there.
Florence Gould reveled in playing host. Chanel designed special ""beach pajamas"" for her that set a fashion trend in
1926. Tennis great Suzanne Lenglen gave her lessons. An intense love affair with Chaplin ended in an offer to star
in his next film - which she turned down, unwilling to leave Frank and his fortune.
""It's true, it's true, I love money,"" she confessed. By the end of the 1930s, the Goulds' empire encompassed 50
hotels, casinos, spas and hundreds of cafes across France.
In Paris, she carried on simultaneous affairs with the American ambassador to France, William Bullitt, and with
Otto Abetz, a Nazi spy. Between them, she was well aware that the continent would soon explode into war.
Yet the Goulds remained in Europe. Escaping to America would force them to cough up millions in unpaid taxes.
France fell to Germany in 1940, and Hitler's troops occupied Paris and much of the country for four years of horror
and hardship. Nearly 80,000 French Jews were deported to Nazi death camps; many more were persecuted, their
property seized. Resistance fighters risked all to undermine the Axis powers. Ordinary citizens endured travel bans,
food shortages and fuel rationing.
Not Florence Gould. Elegant and still beautiful at 45, she used sex and charm as her currency, trading them for
favors and luxuries that let her sail through the war years unscathed.
She slept with Helmut Knochen, the city's top Gestapo commander, and entertained his boss Carl Oberg, the
notorious SS and police leader. The head of the city's Abwehr, or military-intelligence service, was another of her
lovers. She was devoted to Ludwig Vogel, a black marketeer and undercover SS agent.
Her new friends-with-benefits tipped her off to auctions where she bid against Hitler's own art dealers to acquire
works that had been looted from Jewish collectors. She snapped up Impressionist and modern canvases deemed
too ""degenerate"" for the Fuhrer's tastes.
With influential fashion editor Marie-Louise Bousquet, Gould set up the ""souris gris"" - gray mouse - prostitution
network. Their ""mice,"" former society women, served as high-class call girls for the Nazi leadership in exchange for
black-market goods.
The occupiers provided all Gould needed to shrug off the war's indignities: unlimited gasoline and travel passes
that let her visit her husband, still in the Riviera, whenever she wished; truckloads of coal to keep her warm while
the rest of Paris shivered; even an exemption from the 1942 round-up of expatriate American women that sent hundreds of them to an internment camp for months.
With the treats the Nazis allowed her, she achieved her girlhood dream of establishing a trend-setting literary
salon, enticing prospective guests with real coffee, gourmet chocolates and roast beef.
In 1944, as the successful D-Day invasion foretold an Allied victory, Gould joined a Nazi money-laundering scheme
meant to funnel over a billion francs of ill-gotten wealth out of Europe before Hitler's defeat. She fronted a new
bank, set up in neutral Monaco, to provide a safe haven for funds that Nazi fugitives could use to start new
postwar lives.
US authorities froze the assets - and launched a treason probe into Gould's actions. But through four years of
review by French and American investigators, she played the victim, insisting that she only went along with the
plot when the Nazis threatened to send her beloved Frank to the camps. A French court ruled in 1948 that her
criminal complicity could not be proven.
""I have slept with the Dear Lord, and the Dear Lord loves me,"" as she liked to say.
After the war, her weekly salon rolled on, its dark origins conveniently forgotten by Salvador Dali, André Gide, Jean
Cocteau and other guests. She became a generous philanthropist, gifting two rare medieval tapestries and ""The
Terrace at Vernonnet,"" a painting by modernist master Pierre Bonnard, to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.
By the time of her death in 1983, at age 88, Gould owned an $8 million collection of jewels, including the fabulous
31.35-carat Victory Diamond and a spectacular three-strand pearl necklace that had been her signature accessory.
Her 180 artworks, including paintings by van Gogh, Renoir, Degas and Monet, sold at auction for $34 million in
1984.
The cash established the Florence Gould Foundation, a New York-based nonprofit that continues to fund artistic
and cultural programs.
Today, the Bonnard hangs in a gallery named in Gould's honor at the Met on Fifth Avenue. The French Institute
Alliance Francaise's Florence Gould Hall on East 59th Street, a film and theater venue, is another legacy.
Florence Gould herself is interred in the Gould family mausoleum at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, a miniature
Parthenon guarded by a weeping beech that the Parks Department has enshrined as one of 65 official ""Great Trees
of New York City.""

Barclays, run by Chief Executive Jes Staley, pays its female investment bankers about half of what it pays men in
the same unit - underscoring the lack of women in senior positions.
On average, Barclays female investment bankers make 48 percent of what their male counterparts do, the
company said in its annual report on Thursday.
UK banks, under a new law, are required to disclose pay disparity.
The report also shows that there's a shrinking number of women in top roles, including managing directors and
board members, since last year.
Staley, in the report, said he was ""confident"" men and women got paid equally for the same job but that the bank
has to continue to push to get more women into higher-level jobs.
Staley said it was the bank's goal to increase female representation on Barclays' board from 21 percent today to 33
percent by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of associates, the lowest-level bankers, are women, while assistant vice presidents, one step up,
are only 38 percent women, the bank said.
Managing directors, the highest level, are just 15 percent female.
US banks, like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, have yet to report their data on pay. They have until April to
make the disclosures.
Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo have all reported that they pay women 99 cents for every dollar they
pay men - however, the banks haven't released their methodology, and skeptics have questioned those
proportions.

A poll by a national nonprofit aimed at increasing Americans' financial know-how revealed that nearly two in five
couples cheat on their significant other when it comes to finances.

Cheating how? Well, by misleading or lying to each other about household finances and spending in most cases,
according to the National Endowment for Financial Education.
Latinos are the most financially faithful, with just 38 percent of respondents saying they cheat. African Americans
are the biggest cheaters, according to the poll, with 56 percent saying they lie about money. Roughly 40 percent of

20-Feb-18,31.7,32.23,31.58,32.18,52763869,bank of america,"The feds dropped a bombshell on the White House Friday, revealing the indictments of 13 Russians - one a close
pal of Vladimir Putin - for sabotaging the presidential election to boost Donald Trump and slime Hillary Clinton.
The Justice Department's stunning announcement alleged that the sophisticated skulduggery began in 2014 and
involved the creation of social-media accounts on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter by more than 80 Russians
working day and night.
The accounts were made to look like they were created by ordinary, grassroots American activists but sought to
sow political and racial discord and disrupt the nation's democracy.
""The defendants allegedly conducted what they called information warfare against the United States with the
stated goal of spreading distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general,"" Deputy Attorney
General Rod Rosenstein told reporters.
""We must not allow them to succeed,"" a stone-faced Rosenstein warned, adding that the case ""serves as a
reminder that people are not always who they appear to be on the Internet.""
Rosenstein said there was no information in the indictment alleging that any Americans contacted by the Russians
were aware of the operation, or that the Russians' efforts determined the election's outcome.
But he stressed that special counsel Robert Mueller's probe was ongoing.
Signed by Mueller, the 37-page, eight-count indictment also charged three businesses.
""By early to mid-2016, defendants' operations included supporting the presidential campaign of then-candidate
Donald J. Trump . . . and disparaging Hillary Clinton,"" the indictment charged.
The feds said the individuals were given $1.25 million a month by a Russian oligarch known as ""Putin's chef,""
Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin through a company known as Concord Catering.
Prigozhin, 56, and Concord Catering are charged in the indictment, as is another Prigozhin company, Concord
Management and Consulting.
The feds said the Russians even taunted the US by hiring an unsuspecting American to stand in front of the White
House on May 29, 2016 - Prigozhin's birthday - holding a sign that said, ""Happy Birthday Dear Boss.""
Prigozhin scoffed at the charges.
""The Americans are really impressionable people. They see what they want to see. I greatly respect them. If they
want to see the devil - let them see him,"" he told Russian media.
The Russians also hired another clueless American to attend rallies dressed as Clinton in a striped prison suit
while sitting on a flatbed truck in a cage.
On social media, they created pages with such names as Blacktivist, United Muslims of America and Army of
Jesus that spread inflammatory disinformation about Clinton,
The United Muslims page, for example, accused her of favoring Sharia law.
Another page, called Woke Blacks, urged African-Americans not to vote - an effort to hurt the Democrat at the polls.
""A particular hype and hatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote for Killary. We cannot
resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we'd surely be better off if we did not vote at all,"" one post read.
One typical ad they placed on social media in September 2016 read, ""Hillary is a Satan, and her crimes and lies had
proved just how evil she is.""
A Twitter account linked to the Russians claimed to be from Tennessee Republicans. A number of American
politicians, celebrities and journalists shared the bogus group's tweets. Among those who retweeted posts from @Ten_GOP were ex-National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, Trump crony
Roger Stone, rapper Nicki Minaj, actor James Woods and conservative columnist Ann Coulter.
Facebook and Twitter took heat from the feds for failing to quickly spot the phony Russian accounts. The socialmedia
giants acknowledged only last fall that they had been duped.
""The nature of the scheme was the defendants took extraordinary steps to make it appear that they were ordinary
American political activists,"" Rosenstein said.
The third indicted company, Internet Research Agency - a ""troll farm"" based in St. Petersburg - ""had a strategic goal
to sow discord in the US political system, including the 2016 US presidential election,"" the indictment said.
In a related action, it was disclosed that a California man, Richard Pinedo, 28, pleaded guilty this month to using
stolen identities to set up bank accounts that were used by the Russians.
Friday's indictment charges all of the defendants with conspiracy to defraud the US and three others with
conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, and five defendants with aggravated identity theft.
None of the Russians was arrested, and Russia was not expected to hand them over. Still, they cannot visit the US
without risking arrest and could face arrest if caught on an ally's soil.
Trump cast the indictment as a vindication of himself.
""Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President. The results
of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!"" he tweeted en route to
his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla.
Trump added in a statement that ""far-fetched theories"" about collusion in the 2016 election ""only serve to further
the agendas of bad actors, like Russia.""
""It's time we stop the outlandish partisan attacks. We must unite as Americans to protect the integrity of our
democracy and our elections,"" he added.
Moments after the indictments were released, Trump's campaign sent out an e-mail seeking donations to fight
""fake news.""
""America is waking up to the fake news. We're waking up to the lies liberals have been feeding our country for
decades. We are still fighting to take our country, and we will not rest,"" the mass e-mail read.
The indictments are the most significant development in Mueller's ongoing probe into Russian meddling.
Trump has repeatedly dismissed charges that Russia interfered in the election, calling it a ""hoax"" and ""fake news"" -
despite agreement among the US intelligence community that Russia interfered to help him in his race against
Clinton.
Campaign of deception
Highlights of the Justice Department's indictment:
n Disinformation campaign began in April 2014 and continued through - and after - the presidential election in
November 2016.
n The campaign was run by the Internet Research Agency of St. Petersburg, Russia, employing more than 80
people on graphic, search-engine optimization, data analysis, finance and information technology. The
budgetexceeded $1.25 million a month by September 2016.
n 13 individuals and three companies charged.
n Yevgeniy Prigozhin (left) was accused of using companies he controlled,including Concord Management and
Consulting and Concord Catering, to finance the operation. He has been called ""Putin's chef"" because his
restaurants host dinners between Vladimir Putin and foreign dignitaries.
n The Russians were advised by an unsuspecting activist ""that they should focus their activities on 'purple states
like Colorado, Virginia and Florida.'""
n Russians used the stolen identities of Americans to post misinformation on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and
Twitter, drawing hundreds of thousands of followers to their fake accounts. Those included accounts called
Secured Borders and United Muslims for America. One account, called Tennessee GOP, attracted more than
100,000 followers. n Prosecutors say PayPal was used to transfer money for general expenses as well as to buy Facebook ads.
Prosecutors say the accounts were opened using fake identities to help bypass PayPal's security measures.
n Russian misinformation specialists were instructed to ""use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest
(except Sanders and Trump - we support them).""
n Many ads bought by the Russians on social media were intended to depress minority votes. ""Hillary Clinton
doesn't deserve the black vote,"" said one ad posted on May 24, 2016. On Nov. 3, 2016, days before the election, the
Russians bought an ad on their Blacktivist account that said: ""Choose peace and vote for Jill Stein. Trust me, it's
not a wasted vote.""
n The Russians promoted campaign rallies, including after the election on Nov. 12 in New York City, to both
support and oppose Trump. At an August 2016 rally in West Palm Beach, Fla., the Russians paid to build a cage on
a flatbed truck and to hire someone to portray Hillary Clinton in a prison uniform.
n There was no allegation that Americans were ""knowing participants.""",0

SNAP's real value
The recent Post editorial on work and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) unfortunately
misses the mark (""Stamping Out Dependency,"" PostScript, Feb. 4).
SNAP supports work in important ways. The share of working people relying on SNAP continues to increase. It
helps workers in low-wage jobs put food on the table. SNAP is also tied to better health and lower health-care
expenditures. During 2016 alone, SNAP supported 50,000 private-sector jobs and $5 billion in economic activity in
New York City.
By focusing narrowly on unemployed, working-age adults without children - only 11 percent of New York's
participating households - you miss the bigger picture: Most SNAP recipients are children, seniors, people with
disabilities or people caring for dependents.
They are our neighbors, co-workers and friends. SNAP is an efficient, job-supporting way to provide the nutrition
assistance they need. We urge the federal government to strengthen this vital program.

Investors white-knuckled themselves through stocks' worst week - capped by a 1000-point swing in the Dow Jones
industrial average on Friday. For the week, the Dow and the S&P 500 fell more than 5 percent - their worst weekly showing since January 2016.
A frantic afternoon rally brought the Dow back from a 486-point hole to close the key index at 24,191 - up 330
points.
""The era of low interest rates is at an end which means the proverbial punch in the punch bowl is leaving the party.
And fast!"" Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG, said in a note.
Wall Street has sold off on concerns that an improving economy will continue to push up wages and force the
Federal Reserve to raise borrowing costs - which can depress corporate earnings.
The past week was one of the most eventful ever for Wall Street, officially ending a winning streak that hadn't seen
a significant pullback since August 2015.
The Dow had its two biggest-ever point drops on Monday and Thursday, in that order.
Even the 560-point gain on Wednesday featured a 1,167-point swing during the session, leaving investors feeling
nauseous.
The upswing on Friday came just one day after US stocks had entered a technical correction, meaning a 10
percent drop from the peak on Jan. 26.
After an eventful day that was deepest in the red by 1:40 p.m., the gains were once again locked in in the last hour
of trading, which saw a nearly 530-point run-up before things levelled off somewhat at the bell.
But even that couldn't save the markets from a historically awful week in which they fell 5.3 percent from the
opening on Monday morning.
That's the worst weekly performance since January, 2016 - when the markets cratered 6.2 percent.
The S&P 500 rose 1.5 percent on Friday, to 2,620, while the Nasdaq gained 1.4 percent, to 6,874.
The recent market rout is the strangest - and most violent - since the start of the Great Recession 10 years ago.
Market watchers attributed some of the swings to complex investments that moved in the opposite direction of
the volatility index - the VIX.
After the VIX - which is also called the ""fear gauge"" - rose by 200 percent on Monday, investors were left totally
wiped out, and some markets were left distorted.
Even with the jarring numbers, Wall Streeters have cautioned that pullbacks are normal and are unlikely to hurt the
economy.
""The equity market sell-off thus far does not alter our outlook for the US economy or monetary policy,"" Bank of

Foles, utterly unfazed by the magnitude of the moment, went toe-to-toe, arm-to-arm, in an epic shootout against
Brady.
Eyeball-to-eyeball with the G.O.A.T. in arguably the G.O.A.T. of Super Bowls.
Threw three touchdown passes and caught another and earned MVP.
""I felt calm. I think the big thing that helped me was knowing that I didn't have to be Superman,"" Foles said.
Except he was.
""I wasn't worried about the scoreboard. I wasn't worried about the time. I was just playing ball,"" Foles said.
He and head coach Doug Pederson fed off each other's fearlessness.
""Whatever Doug called, I was just going to go out there and rip it,"" Foles said.
As hearts raced and throats lumped and America stood mesmerized towards the end, it was Eagles 32, Patriots 26,
and of course Brady yawned.
Hit Danny Amendola for 30 yards and Gronk against Ronald Darby with a 4-yard touchdown pass. Patriots 33,
Eagles 32 with 9:22 left and Pederson was wishing he hadn't attempted a failed two-point conversion in the second
quarter. Pederson, fourth-and-1 at his 45, went for it. Of course he did. And Foles hit Ertz for 2 yards. Then Nelson Agholor
for 10. Then Agholor again for 18. Then Agholor again for 11.
Then Ertz - ruled a runner before the ball hit the ground as he hurtled into the end zone - in an 11-yard TD against a
stumbling Devin McCourty. Eagles 38, Patriots 33 after the failed two-point conversion.
So here was Brady, 2:21 and one timeout left, trailing 38-33, 75 yards from the Lombardi Trophy. And he was stripsacked
by Brandon Graham. Derek Barnett recovered the fumble.
Soon it was Eagles 41, Patriots 33.
Now there stood Brady, 58 seconds and no timeouts left, 91 yards from the Lombardi Trophy.
Hail no!
It had been a wild-and-crazy first half, a wide-open Brady dropping a pass from Amendola, who had taken a pitch
from James White, three plays after Malcolm Jenkins had knocked Brandin Cooks out with a head injury, Keystone
Cops kicking games, and here was Pederson, fourth-and-goal at the 1, ahead 15-12, being the riverboat gambler
again:
A trick play for the ages that maybe only Spygate could have prevented.
A direct snap to Corey Clement.
A pitch to Trey Burton.
A 1-yard TD pass to ... Nick Foles ... NICK FOLES! ... leaking out wide open on the right side.
""We hit it at the right time,"" Foles said.
PHILLY. PHINALLY.

Jackson family still angry at JT over Nipplegate",0
13-Mar-18,32.17,32.44,32.05,32.42,61796254,bank of america,"BLOOMINGTON, Minn. - Kirk Cousins was seated at a table in the Mall of America food court Wednesday when two
reporters from New York approached.
The Redskins quarterback, who is about to be the hottest free agent in the NFL, politely declined to discuss his
pending free agency or the Jets. As one of the reporters walked away, he said, ""maybe we'll talk in a few months.""
""We'll see,"" Cousins said with a smile.
The agreed-upon trade of Alex Smith to the Redskins on Tuesday night made it clear that Cousins will be a free
agent when the league year begins March 14.
The Jets are expected to be one of several teams that will make a push to sign him. The question will be how big of a push?
Will Woody and Christopher Johnson hand general manager Mike Maccagnan a blank check to sign Cousins?
That would not be like the Jets.
They have not chased big free agents in recent years with the exception of Darrelle Revis in 2015, and that did not
exactly work out.
But the Jets need a quarterback, and Cousins is going to be the big, shiny prize of free agency.
""This comes down to: What is the value?"" former Ravens coach Brian Billick said Wednesday. ""Obviously,
Washington did not want to give Cousins one of those $100 million guaranteed contracts. I don't know if it was
offered to Cousins. I can very easily see if he was offered the [four-year, $94 million] contract Alex Smith was
offered, he thinks he can get more. He might in the open market."" There is no doubt that Cousins is going to
become the highest paid player in NFL history because he is the latest starting quarterback to hit the market.
It has become not about whether the player is ""worth"" the money. It is about where the market is.
The Redskins did not believe in Cousins enough to sign him to a long-term deal, instead using the franchise tag on
him in 2016 and 2017 to pay him $44 million over the two seasons. The Redskins being willing to let him leave as a
free agent has to be a red flag for teams.
A few weeks ago, former Redskins general manager Scot McCloughan told a Denver radio station: ""He's a good
player. Is he special? I don't see special.
But also, we were still building a roster around him to make him special."" Here at the Super Bowl, Eagles backup
quarterback Nate Sudfeld praised Cousins, whom he played with in 2016 in Washington.
""I think the world of Kirk,"" Sudfeld said. ""The guy is a pro's pro, as classy as they get. He always does and says all
the right things. His talent speaks for itself.
He's got incredible arm talent, the way he can speed up his mechanics and get the ball out with quick decisions.""
Speaking to several NFL front office executives on Wednesday about Cousins reveals a belief around the league
that Cousins is a good quarterback who needs a strong team around him to win. He is not viewed as an elite
passer like Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees or Tom Brady, but the belief is a team can win with him.
""There's no question that Kirk Cousins is a capable quarterback,"" Billick said. ""With the Jets, is he the guy?
We'll find out. They're going to have to do a whole lot more than just Kirk Cousins to get that thing back on track.""
That is another part of this equation.
Cousins will have options. Will he want to play for the Jets, who are coming off back-to-back 5-11 seasons and are
entering Year 2 of a rebuild. A team like the Broncos or Jaguars might be more attractive to Cousins because of
the supporting cast.
""Is money a part of it? Sure. Is it the only thing? No,"" Cousins said on Pro Football Talk on Tuesday. ""It's about
winning, and that's what I want more than anything. So I'm going to be willing to make sacrifices or do what has to
be done to make sure I'm in the best possible position to win, and that's what the focus is going to be."" Like
Cousins said, we'll see.

the whole way through Super Bowl Opening Night. From here until Super Sunday, Tom Brady will still be America's
Pretty Boy - Father Time hasn't laid a glove on his face, somehow 40-years-old now, much less his golden arm.
But looks are deceiving indeed. Because five times now he has revealed himself as much more than another pretty
face.
Five times he has hoisted the Lombardi Trophy - it would have been seven times were it not for Eli Manning - and
he is relentlessly stalking his sixth.
Because he is a stone-cold assassin.
""It's like he's a shark almost, man, emotionless on the field,"" ex-Giant Osi Umenyiora said. ""He's just like laserfocused,
man. You hit him, he doesn't seem to be affected by it on the field. You've seen him once he goes to the
sidelines react.""
Eagles right tackle Lane Johnson, speaking for all of Philadelphia after the Birds punched their Super Bowl ticked,
has announced: ""Hey, Tom Brady. Pretty boy, Tom Brady. He's the best quarterback of all time, so nothing I'd like to
do more than dethrone that guy.""
Be careful what you wish for.
""I'd hate me too, if I was in Philadelphia right now,"" Brady said.
And there are plenty of other precincts outside of New England that second that emotion.
Where there is both hate and jealousy of Pretty Boy Tom Brady.
For a myriad of reasons, Brady has entered the conversation of most polarizing athletes. He's not quite in a league
with Mike Tyson, Muhammad Ali, Tim Tebow or Tiger Woods, but arguably up there with Michael Jordan, who won
six NBA championships.
And here are five reasons - one for each ring:
1. Deflategate deflated his image, of course it did (cell phone, please).
2. His unconventional TB12 lifestyle isn't what we would have expected from, say, Johnny Unitas ... JU19, anyone?
Joe Namath fueled his system with Johnnie Walker Red, for crying out loud (""I like my girls blonde and my Johnnie
Walker Red."" Nothing about avocado ice cream). To each his own, I guess.
3. Brady doesn't have to be a rebel with a nightlife because he is married to the beautiful Gisele Bundchen.
How many red-blooded American males secretly wish they were Tom Effin Brady?
4. He wins too damn much. When will enough be enough for this guy?
5. He is Belichick's quarterback.
All these years later, he is the Iceman, with a raging fire that burns inside and has never flamed out.
""I always say I think there's a lot of inner drive that I've been very lucky to be born with,"" Brady said.
He was fittingly sitting at podium No. 6.
""Coincidence,"" Brady said.
Someone asked him how to make Belichick smile and Brady paused and said: ""Just say Navy ... lacrosse ... Lawrence Taylor ... Bon Jovi - those four.""
Someone mentioned Adam Sandler starring in ""The Longest Yard,"" and Brady said: ""I love Adam Sandler. Even
though he's a Jets fan.""
His mother grew up in a tiny Minnesota town called Browerville. His parents married there in 1969.
""That really is my roots, and it's very much a part of who I am,"" Brady said. ""My mom lived here for 18 years, and I
was very lucky to come back here every summer, in the winter sometimes. My grandpa lived in that farm. It was a
great experience for a kid from California to have this other part of my life that is so very special.""
He won't have time to visit.
""This trip's all business,"" Brady said. ""I remember the two times we lost - it's just pain. It's just pain.""
Four times he has been Super Bowl MVP. In his last two Super Bowl wins, Brady is 80-for-112 for 774 yards with six
touchdowns and three interceptions (15 touchdowns, five interceptions in his seven Super Bowls).
Pretty Boy on Monday through Saturday.

13-Mar-18,31.99,32.14,31.59,31.69,64749717,bank of america,"Readers: Illegal immigration is certainly a hot-button issue.
Last week I carried a letter from a reader, called SB, who had a staunchly anti-immigration view.
""Babies born here from non-citizen parents are not American citizens and can be thrown out with the parents or
have to be naturalized like any legal immigrant if their parents are here legally,"" said SB.
I invited readers to share their thoughts. Here is a representative sample of the responses.
Dear John: You may not like it but I agree with SB.
Especially everything said about illegal immigrants. They are ILLEGAL so why in hell are they being protected?
Become a US citizen - that is what you are supposed to do! I just don't understand why there is a question - they
have no rights - they don't deserve any rights!
Why are DACA kids eligible for help going to college when we barely get by and my daughter can't get any help and
is going to be broke for the next 15 years trying to pay off her loans?
Just not fair. LD
Dear John: I agree with SB's sentiment on illegals, but I would do it slightly differently.
1. Any person the government can prove is in the US illegally should be removed immediately.
2. Fine employers $10,000 for every illegal on their payroll.
3. Confiscate all property of illegal aliens.
4. Freeze all bank accounts of illegal aliens.
5. Any person who knowingly harbors an illegal alien will have their home subject to forfeiture and face 1 year in
prison.
Dear John: SB came on pretty strong, but his ideas are absolutely on track.
His big picture is right on the money with the details not as easy to achieve.
Totally right about handouts being way too easy and that they take away incentive from people even wanting to
work. And illegals need to [work]. At the very least, [they should] go to the back of the line and definitely be
considered for deportation.
If not, you create a slippery slope and open doors that are almost impossible to close. I have worked and paid
taxes as a proud American-born citizen my whole life and I do not need or want to be subsidizing illegals while paying a fortune in health care even with my employer's help. JP
Dear John: My response to SB: I've always been a firm believer that work input should equal work output.
Obviously our government doesn't believe in this simple equation, with some getting something for nothing.
Dear John: In response to the letter you printed from SB.
My thoughts are quite simple, SB. SPOT ON!! RML
Dear John: Hurrah for the person who wants to stop giving away tax dollars of people who actually work. He
should be governor of NJ! GK
Dear John: SB, you are damned right! JF
Dear John: SB touched on most of the subjects that are avoided in the news. Thanks to SB for his truthful insight,
and to you, John Crudele, for having the guts to print it. It should have been on page 1. JB
Dear John: How come u didn't respond to SB the letter was 99% correct!!! Were u afraid??? DFB
Dear DFB: No, I'm not ""afraid."" In fact, I'll give you my thoughts on immigration in Tuesday's column.
I just thought it would be nice to hear my readers' opinions for a change.
He found his job in The NY Post!
Dear John: Please put me in touch with JM, who said in your column last week that he and other employers had
jobs that they couldn't fill.
I have two unemployed sons who have been out of work for a long time in Nassau and Suffolk counties on Long
Island - one a purchasing manager and the other an electronics engineer. Thanks. PH
Dear PH: OK, I sent your e-mail, and JM, the guy who complained he couldn't find workers, says he might have
something for the engineer son if he is willing to move to South Carolina, where he has a plant. You have each
other's e-mail addresses, so you can take it from here.
Dear John: The world is one large Ponzi scheme - shifting piles of sand from one country to the next only to blow
away in the wind while a few at the top fill their pockets. FM
Dear FM: Wow! Deep.
Let me see if I can match you on this.
In the first place, people who have money usually are able to make more. That really makes perfect sense, since
they are in a better position to take advantage of opportunities, whether in business or with regard to tax law
changes or because they have politicians in their pockets.
Money may not buy happiness, but it certainly buys some amount of security.
A Ponzi scheme is a confidence game - a con. When you look at it like that - yes, the whole world is one big
confidence game.

13-Mar-18,31.8,32.365,31.77,31.87,72210258,bank of america,"It was Nov. 23, 2017, the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade. Dressed in monochromatic black, a ""gray and tiredlooking""
Matt Lauer was overheard telling a co-worker, ""This is going to be my last parade.""
The noose was tightening around the neck of the ""Today"" show host. Just six days later, America's ""favorite dad""
was unceremoniously ditched by NBC following a ""detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual
behavior in the workplace.""
But while 60-year-old Lauer was resigned to his fate the day of the parade, insiders tell The Post that he fought to
the bitter end. He lied about previous liaisons, repeatedly telling top bosses he had nothing to confess or feel
ashamed about.
Then Lauer admitted only that he'd had three ""consensual"" affairs during his 25 years at ""Today.""
Even now, he struggles to accept that his fall was so swift.
""He goes between sadness and acceptance of his fate, to disbelief how it all happened so quickly and how the
situation was so out of his control,"" says a source close to him.
It was in mid-November, around six weeks after the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke, that years of speculation
about Lauer's ""indiscretions"" were being seriously examined.
According to the NBC source who eavesdropped on Lauer's ominous Thanksgiving parade prediction"", ""He was
already being investigated by Variety magazine, but at that point, nobody knew what they had got on him.
""The Times was calling around, saying they were doing a piece on the culture of the 'Today' show, and The Enquirer
was asking about settlements paid to female staff members who had affairs with Matt.""
During that period, NBC President Noah Oppenheimer and Chairman Andy Lack, Lauer's close friend, and others
approached him ""several times,"" asking, ""Is there anything we should know or be worried about?""
Lauer responded each time, ""I am racking my brains, but I can't think of anything.""
Gossip had dogged Lauer at 30 Rock that he was cheating on his wife of 19 years, former model Annette Roque.
In particular, the rumors focused on a suspected dalliance with ""Today"" contributor Giada De Laurentiis, with whom
the anchor was spotted on a beach in Barbados in 2011. (Both Lauer and De Laurentiis denied an affair.)
But, according to the NBC source, ""Genuinely, nobody at NBC News had any idea at this stage that he was preying
on younger staffers at 'Today.'
""Nobody knew what Matt was doing with the interns and junior producers. It was appalling.""
That all changed after Lauer's first accuser, still employed at NBC, came forward the weekend after Thanksgiving.
A meeting with her lawyers was hastily arranged with Human Resources for 6 p.m. on Monday, Nov. 27.
""She told them she had a sexual relationship with Matt during the Sochi Olympics in 2014, and it continued when
they returned to New York,"" says the insider.
""She was a very junior staff member at the time so there was a clear issue of balance of power.""
The source says the woman provided ""irrefutable evidence"" - speculated to be a naked photograph of Lauer. And
the accuser also claimed ""that she wasn't the only woman he'd done this to.""
The complaint triggered a rapid chain of events, not least because the accuser was represented by renowned civilrights
and employment lawyer Ari Wilkenfeld.
""She had a high-powered attorney from Washington, DC, and so everyone knew if NBC didn't take swift action, they
would have arranged for a sit-down interview with a competitor,"" a second source tells The Post.
Tellingly, in a Nov. 29 statement, Wilkenfeld noted, ""Our impression at this point is that NBC acted quickly, as all
companies should, when confronted with credible allegations of sexual misconduct in the workplace.""
If Lauer had an inkling of the thunderbolt that was about to strike, he didn't show it during his Tuesday, Nov. 28,
appearance on ""Today"" - the morning of his firing.
""He was acting his usual cocky, confident self,"" says the first insider. ""He had no idea that this would turn out to be
his last day on the show.""
Indeed, the anchor was in stitches on-screen, recalling the previous year's holiday tree lighting at Rockefeller
Center, which had been a washout. He even jocularly poked Savannah Guthrie in the arm to make his point as they
perched on the sofa with co-hosts Al Roker, Hoda Kotb and Dylan Dreyer. By that afternoon, however, Lauer, who earned $20 million per year, had lawyered up.
He and an associate of his personal lawyer, William Zabel, sat through a crunch-time meeting with HR executives
and representatives from NBC's legal department. The accusations were leveled about the Sochi episode and other
matters. ""Matt was at first unapologetic, defending himself,"" says the employee close to the situation. ""He claimed
he'd had three consensual affairs in the 25 years at 'Today.' ""
A third source tells The Post, ""They were all much more than a quick f--k.""
However, as the evidence was put to him, his demeanor changed.
""He became quiet and didn't argue,"" adds the first insider. ""He accepted that it didn't look good.""
Both sources revealed that no decision was made about Lauer's future at the meeting.
Instead, he was fired in person that night at his weekday Manhattan apartment in Lenox Hill, where swindler Bernie
Madoff used to live. The messenger? Lauer's one-time pal, Lack.
""It [the atmosphere] was very cold,"" says the third source, who is an acquaintance of Lauer's. But the NBC insider
claims Lack was ""furious"" and called out his behavior as ""reprehensible.""
""Matt, I was told, remained quiet,"" the NBC insider added.
News of Lauer's dismissal was relayed to Kotb and Guthrie at 4 a.m., as they were traveling to 30 Rock in their cars
on their way to work on Wednesday, Nov. 29.
""They were shocked, there were tears, but they had time to work on their opening remarks [to the TV audience]
about Matt,"" says their colleague.
The shock announcement led at least two other women to immediately come forward to NBC with claims similar
to those of the initial accuser. One complaint was from a former employee who said Lauer had sex with her in his
locked office in 2001. She alleged she lost consciousness and woke up on the floor. ""She said she didn't report the
encounter at the time because she felt ashamed and feared losing her job,"" says the second insider.
NBC News declined to comment for this story. Representatives for Lauer did not respond to The Post's requests
for comment, but previously issued a statement in which he expressed his ""sorrow and regret for the pain I have
caused others by words and actions."" He added, ""Some of what is being said about me is untrue or
mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed.""
According to another NBC insider, Lauer was referring to the passed-out woman's claims when he spoke about
untruths.
""Matt didn't deny that because he didn't want to walk through all the allegations,"" the insider said. ""He just felt
there was no point in saying anything, apart from what he said in his statement.""
But a ""Today"" show staffer, who requested anonymity for fear ofbeing fired, went even further in defending Lauer,
blaming the climate of the #MeToo movement.
""What happened with Matt's immediate firing was an unprecedented set of circumstance,"" the staffer said.
""Remember, NBC News spent over a month investigating Brian Williams' 'untruths,' so why, with Lauer, did they
have no other choice but to fire him immediately, with no hearing or investigation?
""NBC News didn't investigate at all. After Matt's 25 years with 'Today,' they simply screamed, 'Off with his head!' ""
Consequently, facing defeat, Lauer retreated to the $36.5 million Hamptons compound he shared with Roque and
their three kids. That was until his wife kicked him out for good, as revealed by Page Six this week. Lauer has
moved into a nearby place so he is on hand for their children, with him and Roque remaining ""cold but cordial,""
sources on Long Island say. The couple was seen arriving separately at their Bridgehampton horse farm earlier this
week.
All this time unemployed has given Lauer a period to reflect. According to the third insider, the veteran newsman is
especially sad that Lack has not spoken to him since the dramatic firing some two months ago.
""Matt is still feeling a lot of shame,"" the insider said. ""But he is angry because he certainly wasn't the only person in
TV doing this, but he has taken the fall.""
He recently told one friend, ""The world is a dark place.""",1

unsolved mysteries.
Their bodies were never found, and the manhunt is still on 56 years later. But could three common crooks really
have survived paddling across the frigid, shark-infested waters surrounding The Rock on a makeshift raft cobbled
together from raincoats?
A newly surfaced letter has reignited hope that the so-crazy-it-just-might-work scheme - made legendary by the
Clint Eastwood film ""Escape from Alcatraz"" - wasn't just a success but that one of the men may still be alive.
""My name is John Anglin. I escaped from Alcatraz in June 1962 with my brother Clarence and Frank Morris. I'm 83
years old and in bad shape. I have cancer,"" reads the letter sent to the San Francisco Police Department in 2013
and aired for the first time by a local CBS affiliate Wednesday.
""Yes, we all made it that night but barely!""
The letter says John Anglin, who would now be 86, lived on the lam in Seattle, North Dakota and now Southern
California. Morris died in 2008 and Clarence Anglin in 2011, it claims.
John says he's reaching out to the feds because he needs a doctor to treat his cancer.
""If you announce on TV that I will be promised to first go to jail for no more than a year and get medical attention, I
will write back to let you know exactly where I am. This is no joke.""
The US Marshals Service says the FBI performed a forensic handwriting analysis on the letter, but the results were
""inconclusive.""
Family members tell The Post it doesn't look like his handwriting - but they do believe all three men survived the
breakout and that John Anglin is still out there.
""The handwriting don't look anything like it. But that's not to say John didn't have somebody else write the letter.
They're pretty intelligent, they know the deal with fingerprints,"" says nephew David Widner, 51.
The marshals say the letter yielded no leads, but the case remains open - even if the agency doesn't seem thrilled
about the possibility that three thieves have evaded their clutches for more than five decades.
""There is absolutely no reason to believe that any of them would have changed their lifestyle and became
completely law-abiding citizens after this escape,"" the agency said in a statement to CBS.
And experts say credible new evidence continues to emerge suggesting that the men survived.
""I definitely believe, with a lot of new evidence that has come to light, that it's possible,"" said Michael Esslinger, a
historical researcher who has penned several books on the escape and has been studying it for decades.
""For the first 20 years as I was doing research, I was very adamant they had died. In the last seven or eight years, I
really changed my opinion.""
It's remarkable enough that small-time bank robbers made it off the famously inescapable island at all - let alone
survived the treacherous swim to shore.
Morris was a career criminal from Washington, DC, who spent his childhood in and out of foster homes and had a
lengthy rap sheet even in his teens.
The Anglins were poor farmers from Florida who had turned to sticking up banks with toy guns.
Morris was a brainiac, according to Esslinger, while the Anglins had learned to be very crafty.
""They grew up with 14 brothers and sisters. They didn't have a lot, so they had to make do with what they had,""
says Widner. ""My mom said they were like MacGyvers.""
Plus, all three were seasoned escape artists and had ended up on Alcatraz precisely because they busted out of
other joints.
In ""Escape from Alcatraz"" Eastwood's Morris is the brains behind the scheme, but Esslinger says it was more of a
team effort between the three - plus a fourth, car thief Allen West, who ultimately failed to escape.
The plan otherwise played out roughly the same as it does in the 1979 film, however, over six months, the men
quietly carved out the ventilation ducts in their cells using spoons and a drill made from a vacuum-cleaner motor
until they could access a utility corridor behind the walls. There, they created a workshop and constructed a raft and life jackets out of pilfered rain jackets - using steam
pipes to seal the seams - and made paddles from scrap wood.
They also made models of their own heads out of soap, toilet paper and hair taken from the prison barbershop to
use as decoys in their beds the night of the break.
Finally on the night of June 11, 1962, the three slipped out - West couldn't get through his duct and was left behind
- and climbed to the prison roof, slid down a smokestack, scaled a fence, inflated their raft with an accordion-like
instrument and set sail for nearby Angel Island.
Thanks to the realistic fake heads, the guards didn't realize what had happened until the next morning. ""If they
made it to the mainland and stole a car, they could've been in Mexico by the time the first bell went off,"" says
Esslinger.
A massive manhunt was mounted, but it failed to find much trace of the fugitives - dead or alive - other than a
paddle and some scraps of life jacket.
Alcatraz officials believed they couldn't possibly have survived the cold, choppy waters, but Widner says the family
has always been sure they made it - and new clues over the past decade have only made them more sure.
""Our family has always believed that they made it,"" he said, noting that the brothers grew up swimming in the icy
waters of Tampa Bay in winter.
""We have a lot inside the family that we haven't shared.""
In 2010, another Anglin brother, Robert, made a deathbed confession to his kin: He'd been in touch with John and
Clarence several times in the first 25 years they were on the run, the family says.
Four years later, Dutch scientists took up the cause and used 3-D modeling of the tides at the time to prove it was
possible they men survived as long as they started paddling between 11 p.m. and midnight.
""In the worst case, the paddling of the escapees is futile . . . the escapees are either swept into the Pacific if they
entered the water before [11 p.m.], or they are pushed deep into the bay and discovered if they enter the water after
midnight,"" wrote researcher Rolf Hut. ""In the best case, the escapees paddle northwards with a speed of almost 1
kilometer per hour, an almost Olympian effort. In that scenario, they most likely survive and make it to the north
side of the Golden Gate bridge.""
In 2015, the History Channel filmed a documentary about the case - with the participation of the family, Esslinger
and the Marshals Service - that yielded several big clues.
The family let investigators dig up the remains of another brother, Alfred, to compare them with bones that washed
ashore in 1983.
The DNA test proved it wasn't an Anglin - shattering what many thought they knew about the case, Esslinger says,
including him. ""I always thought that was a powerful piece of evidence,"" he said.
The Anglins also revealed during the show that in the 1990s, a drug smuggler and family friend told them he'd run
into John and Clarence at a bar in Brazil in the 1970s - and gave them a photo apparently showing the two as
middle-aged men at a farm they'd bought down there.
The Marshals don't think it's legitimate, but a forensic expert on the documentary found it was ""highly likely"" that
they're the same men.
""When you work these types of cases, there's a feeling you get when stuff starts to fall into place,"" Art Roderick, the
retired US marshal who was lead investigator on the case for 20 years and who worked on the documentary, told
The Post at the time.
""I'm getting this feeling now.""
But looking back on the show now, Widner is livid that investigators he worked with never told the family about the
2013 letter - and if his uncle was really out there dying from cancer, he hopes it isn't too late.
""It's inhumane to not let the family know they received a letter, whether it was him or not,"" he said. ""At least we
would have known it could possibly be John reaching out. That upset my mom a lot . . . we would love to get the
word to him that if he would get in touch with us, maybe we could help him.""",0
9-Mar-18,32.39,32.47,31.87,32.21,68117398,bank of america,"During the financial crisis, the federal government bailed out banks it declared ""too big to fail."" Fearing their
bankruptcy might trigger economic Armageddon, the feds propped them up with taxpayer cash.
Something similar is happening now at the FBI, with the Washington wagons circling the agency to protect it from
charges of corruption. This time, the appropriate tag line is ""too big to believe.""
Yet each day brings credible reports suggesting there is a massive scandal involving the top ranks of America's
premier law-enforcement agency. The reports, which feature talk among agents of a ""secret society"" and suddenly
missing text messages, point to the existence both of a cabal dedicated to defeating Donald Trump in 2016 and of
a plan to let Hillary Clinton skate free in the classified e-mail probe.
If either one is true - and I believe both probably are - it would mean FBI leaders betrayed the nation by abusing
their powers in a bid to pick the president.
More support for this view involves the FBI's use of the Russian dossier on Trump that was paid for by the Clinton
campaign and the Democratic National Committee. It is almost certain that the FBI used the dossier to get FISA
court warrants to spy on Trump associates, meaning it used the opposition research of the party in power to
convince a court to let it spy on the candidate of the other party - likely without telling the court of the dossier's
political link.
Even worse, there is growing reason to believe someone in President Barack Obama's administration turned over
classified information about Trump to the Clinton campaign.
As one former federal prosecutor put it, ""It doesn't get worse than that."" That prosecutor, Joseph diGenova,
believes Trump was correct when he claimed Obama aides wiretapped his phones at Trump Tower.
These and other elements combine to make a toxic brew that smells to high heaven, but most Americans don't
know much about it. Mainstream media coverage has been sparse and dismissive and there's a blackout from the
same Democrats obsessed with Russia, Russia, Russia.
Partisan motives aside, it's as if a scandal of this magnitude is more than America can bear - so let's pretend
there's nothing to see and move along.
But, thankfully the disgraceful episode won't be washed away, thanks to a handful of congressional Republicans,
led by California Rep. Devin Nunes, chairman of the House's Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. After he
accused the FBI of stonewalling in turning over records, the bureau relented, at least partially.
The result was clear evidence of bias against Trump by officials charged with investigating him and Clinton. Those
same agents appear to have acted on that bias to tilt the election to Clinton.
In one text message, an agent suggests that Attorney General Loretta Lynch knew while the investigation was still
going on that the FBI would not recommend charges against Clinton.
How could she know unless the fix was in?
All roads in the explosive developments lead to James Comey (below left), whose Boy Scout image belied a
sinister belief that he, like his infamous predecessor J. Edgar Hoover, was above the law.
It is why I named him J. Edgar Comey last year and wrote that he was ""adept at using innuendo and leaks"" to let
everybody in Washington know they could be the next to be investigated.
It was in the office of Comey's top deputy, Andrew McCabe, where agents discussed an ""insurance policy"" in the
event that Trump won. Reports indicated that the Russia- collusion probe was that insurance policy.
The text was from Peter Strzok (below right), the top investigator on the Trump case, and was sent to Lisa Page, an
FBI lawyer and also his mistress. ""I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy's office - that there's no way he gets elected -
but I'm afraid we can't take that risk. It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40 . . . ""
Strzok wrote.
It is frightening that Strzok, who called Trump ""an idiot,"" was the lead investigator on both the Clinton and Trump
cases.
After these messages surfaced, special counsel Robert Mueller (below center) removed Strzok and Page from his
probe, though both still work at the FBI.
Strzok, despite his talk of an ""insurance policy"" in 2016, wrote in May of 2017 that he was skeptical Mueller's probe
would find anything on Trump because ""there's no big there there.""
Talk about irony. While Dems and the left-wing media already found Trump guilty of collusion before Mueller was
appointed, the real scandal might be the conduct of the probers themselves.
Suspicions are hardly allayed by the fact that the FBI says it can't find five months of messages between Strzok
and Page, who exchanged an estimated 50,000 messages overall. The missing period - Dec. 14, 2016 through May
17, 2017 - was a crucial time in Washington.
There were numerous leaks of classified material just before and after Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20th.
And the president fired Comey last May 9, provoking an intense lobbying effort for a special counsel, which led to
Mueller's appointment on May 19.
Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, has emerged from his hidey hole to notice that the FBI has run amok, and said
Monday he would ""leave no stone unturned"" to find the five months of missing texts.
Fine, but the House is racing ahead of him. Nunes has prepared a four-page memo, based on classified material
that purportedly lays out what the FBI and others did to corrupt the election.

9-Mar-18,30.62,31.44,30.54,31.12,95055132,bank of america,"Now in the 14th year of a four-year term, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has been something of a riddle.
His modest, gentlemanly demeanor was a welcome contrast to that of his thuggish predecessor, Yasser Arafat.
Yet the difference in style never led to any diplomatic breakthroughs with Israel. Indeed, there has been scant
progress, despite promising moments and widespread international support for the creation of a Palestinian state.
And now we know why. Underneath it all, Abbas (pictured) is a two-faced, feckless leader who harbors a classic,
anti-Semitic view of Jews and world history.
The 82-year-old exposed himself in a nutty, blame-everybody speech Sunday in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
His intent was to bury President Trump for declaring that America recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's capital and
plans to move our embassy there, but instead, Abbas made the president look wiser than Solomon.
Trump's action, which broke with past presidents who gave Palestinians a heckler's veto over our policies, ripped
the mask off of Abbas' seeming moderation to reveal the same old Jew hatred that has been the cause of war after
war between Israel and its neighbors.
Equally important, the speech, which rambled on for 2/[2] hours, confirmed what Israel has been saying for years:
Abbas never would have made a lasting peace with the Jewish state.
And without that peace, a Palestinian state will remain a pipe dream.
As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu put it, Abbas' incendiary performance made it clear ""that the roots of the
conflict are opposition to a Jewish state within any borders. Not only the way he spoke, but the things he said help
us show the truth.""
Abbas' outlandish claims included a demand that Britain apologize for the 1917 Balfour Declaration, which
endorsed the idea of a Jewish homeland, and his charge that Israel drugs Palestinian children.
Incredibly, he even insisted that European Jews chose to remain there during the Holocaust.
""The Jews did not want to emigrate even with murder and slaughter. Even during the Holocaust, they did not
emigrate. By 1948, Jews in Palestine were no more than 640,000, most of them from Europe,"" he said.
He neglected to mention the reason why: During the war years, British authorities blocked most Jews from going
to Palestine following demands from Arab leaders.
After the war, Abbas continued, Europeans wanted to get rid of their surviving Jews, so deported them to Palestine.
""They wanted to bring Jews here from Europe to maintain European interests in the region,"" he claimed, adding
that ""Israel is a colonialist project that has nothing to do with Jews.""
Those conspiracy theories echo Abbas' long-ago Ph.D. thesis from a Russian university that the Holocaust was
overstated and that Jews had no historic claims to Palestine. Apparently, facts and time haven't educated him.
His speech, to a Palestinian legislative body, was ""professional suicide,"" an American official told me. ""It was a
meltdown where he showed his true colors and his intense hatred for the United States, Israel and the Jewish people. I don't know how he ever walks it back.""
The vitriol was extraordinary, even by Mideast standards. Abbas leveled a personal curse on Trump's house,
meaning his descendants, and spewed invective at fellow Arabs, especially Saudi Arabia, telling them to ""go to hell""
for criticizing him.
One possible explanation is that, after Trump's declaration about Jerusalem, Abbas felt trapped. He is not popular
at home, and even his efforts to spark demonstrations over Jerusalem fell flat.
It's also likely that Abbas was rebuffed by other countries that were critical of Trump's move, including some in
Europe and the Mideast. They probably told Abbas that he had no alternative except to deal with the United States
if he had any hopes of brokering a deal with Israel so that part of Jerusalem could also be a Palestinian capital.
Instead of following that conciliatory path, which might have yielded real progress, Abbas lashed out, declaring the
end of negotiations, promised to keep paying terrorists' families and talked of canceling existing agreements with
Israel.
His condemnations, which included attacks on America's UN ambassador, Nikki Haley, and David Friedman, the
American ambassador to Israel, almost guarantee that Trump will follow through with plans to slash American aid
to the UN agency that ministers to Palestinians, perhaps by half.
And Abbas likely sidelined himself from any dealings with the Trump administration, which has promised to
propose a settlement plan. But with no obvious replacement and no timetable for elections, the upshot is that
Abbas' blaze-of-glory act will do nothing for Palestinians except further delay their hopes of getting a state.
This sorry moment is no victory for anyone - except the truth. Rarely has there been such clarity that Israel has no
partner for peace.
As such, the possibility of more terrorist violence cannot be minimized. Just Tuesday, Israeli authorities removed a
cellphone bomb from Joseph's Tomb in Nablus in the West Bank.
It was detonated by security forces not long before 1,000 Jewish worshippers were scheduled to come to the spot
considered to be the burial site of the biblical patriarch.
Oddly, Abbas condemned the attempted slaughter. But after his fiery remarks, what did he expect?",0

In addition to President Trump's tax overhaul - a move that can add billions of dollars to the bottom line of the
country's major banks - rollbacks on regulations could add even billions more in profits, thanks to fewer fines and
less money spent on meeting regulations.
The improved prospects for the banks will come to light this week as Wall Street's financial giants report 2017 results - and give outlooks for 2018.
Many fattened bottom lines will come on top of already-record profits.
Not that brighter futures for the banks were a secret to investors. The Trump administration has made no secret of
its aim to cut regulatory red tape, tax and civil enforcement.
Shares of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley popped close to or more than 30
percent over the past year - easily outdistancing the S&P 500.
The gifts bestowed upon the banks by ""Santa"" Trump include:
n Easing up on enforcement by installing bank-friendly regulators, like Mick Mulvaney, the new interim head of the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau;
n Repealing rules that make it easier to bring class-action suits - hence pushing customers into arbitration, a bankfriendlier
environment.
n Granting additional waivers to banks over fines;
n Cutting the income tax to 21 percent.
""Enforcement is always the key,"" Anat Admati, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business - and
author of ""The Bankers' New Clothes: What's Wrong With Banking And What to Do About It"" - told The Post. ""Rules
mean nothing if you don't enforce them.""
Banks may even get a break from the Federal Reserve.
""Changing the tenor of supervision will probably actually be the biggest part of what it is that I do,"" Randal Quarles,
the Fed's top regulator, told bankers during his first public remarks on the job.
Late last month, the Trump administration granted three-year and five-year waivers to five banks - including
Deutsche Bank, to which Trump owes about $130 million, even after it was found to have manipulated interest
rates.
While the Obama administration had also granted one-year waivers to do business, the waivers offered by Trump's
regulators are three times and five times as long.
The Securities and Exchange Commission last year brought 17 percent fewer enforcement actions than in 2016 -
the lowest level since 2013, according to a study by Georgetown University.
The amount of SEC fines also fell 15.5 percent, the study showed.
Some observers on Wall Street see it differently, however.
Bankers have long grumbled that the Obama administration used Wall Street as a piggy bank, levying fines for
small infractions and scapegoating the industry over the financial crisis.
The Trump administration's move to shield banks from getting punished by wronged customers - by shelving the
rules in 2017 that gave a smoother path to class-action lawsuits - was called a ""hard-fought victory for the banking
industry"" by its lobbying group, the American Bankers Association.
Already, investors are beginning to understand just how much the tax overhaul will mean to banks.
JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, earned $4.23 billion last year. Dimon said on Friday the tax law
change would add $3.6 billion to its bottom line in 2018.
Less known is what effect the tax overhaul and the added profits it will bring banks - plus the rate increases by the
Fed - will have on bank customers.

support for restoring congressional earmarks. That may ""make the legislative process a bit more efficient,"" agrees
Phillip Wegmann at the Washington Examiner, but earmarks ""also lead to waste"" - as Trump himself has admitted.
Fact is, ""when negotiations break down, obstructionists sell their votes for things like a $233-million bridge nobody
needs."" And today's Republicans, most of whom were elected after 2010, ""have no personal knowledge or
experience with earmarks."" More significantly, these ""post-pork members didn't witness the conservative crusade
to end the practice."" So much for the ""political revolution launched against the swamp"" from across the political
spectrum ""all the way from Bernie to Trump voters.""
Policy expert: One TV Network's Key to Success America's political divide expresses itself in TV preferences, says Steven Malanga at the LA Times. Regions that
backed Hillary Clinton tend to ""prefer political satire and stories with darker themes, anti-heroes and
unconventional families,"" while pro-Trump areas ""are more likely to watch shows that express traditional family
values and also steer away from political themes and stories that denigrate religion."" So serving Trump voters has
been ""a big winner"" for the Hallmark Channel and its affiliates: ""Amid declining viewership and revenue at many TV
networks, the Hallmark channels are on a roll."" They've done so by using the formula ""that once defined
mainstream television. Its dramas and mysteries are untouched by the violence and gore that characterize so
much of crime TV these days.""",1
14-Mar-18,29.41,31.29,29.3,31.2,165878399,bank of america,"BRIDGEPORT, Conn. - The 2017-18 hockey season is all about learning for Rangers first-round pick Filip Chytil:
adjusting to the speed and physicality of the game in a new country and playing with brand new teammates.
And then there are the off-ice lessons, which the 18-year-old center, who was drafted 21st overall in June, is taking
in stride.
""You're now paying your own bills, you're responsible for your own laundry, you're responsible for your groceries -
all life skills that you have to learn as a young player,"" AHL Hartford coach Keith McCambridge said.
After making the Rangers' opening-day roster out of camp and playing the first two games of his pro career in the
NHL, the organization had a decision to make: send Chytil to the Wolf Pack in Hartford, Conn., or back to his native
Czech Republic to play for HC Zlin. They chose the AHL. While he certainly misses home, Chytil is grateful for the
chance to stay stateside.
""We decided I'll stay here and I think it's better for my development. I think it can help me be in the NHL,"" Chytil,
who had five goals and seven assists in 15 games entering Wednesday, told The Post. ""I'm glad I'm here because
it's great for young players. I'm looking forward to the second half of the season.""
That unofficially began Wednesday when Chytil returned to play for Hartford in a 2-1 shootout win over Bridgeport
at Webster Bank Arena. It was his first game back since playing for the Czech Republic at the World Junior
Championship tournament.
McCambridge said he liked the way Chytil played in the tournament and also his attitude in the days surrounding it.
""We found right before he went over to the world juniors, there was a little bit of excitement in him and since he's
come back here, [from] the chance to spend time with his countrymen,"" McCambridge said. ""He always has a smile
on his face, but even more so.""
Chytil also got to spend some time with the Rangers' other 2017 first-round pick, Lias Andersson, the No. 7
selection, who captained the Swedish team.
Now back to life in the AHL where Chytil is getting used to the different style of play.
""The biggest thing that jumps out with Fil is the skill set, the ability to make plays in traffic, the vision when he has
the puck, seeing the ice, in the offensive zone the anticipation of where the next play is going to be made,""
McCambridge said. ""Part of him learning this North American game is making sure that - tendencies when guys
come over from Europe is they're going away from the puck instead of coming towards the puck, because
obviously you have more room to wind up with regards to your speed with the ice-surface difference.""
Chytil has battled through some minor injuries this season, but was back in the starting lineup playing alongside
Ryan Gropp and Scott Kosmachuk.
""Sometimes you catch yourself and you have to take a step back and look to see that he is only 18,"" McCambridge
said. ""But we like the growth that he's made and we're real happy he's made the decision to play over here in North
America with us.""
Just months after Chytil was drafted, he got the chance to live out his childhood dream of playing in the NHL. But
after getting a quick taste, he wants to punch his return ticket to Broadway.
""I want to be back,"" Chytil said. ""It's the best league in the world. I played against players like [Nathan] MacKinnon
or Auston Matthews and I watched them last year on the TV. [This year] I played against them. I want to be like
them and I'm doing everything to be a better player and be there as soon as possible.""",0
14-Mar-18,31.12,31.98,29.15,30.26,155908256,bank of america,"President Trump on Wednesday revived a campaign promise to toughen America's libel laws to make it easier for
people to sue authors and media outlets.
""We are going to take a strong look at our country's libel laws so that when somebody says something that is false
and defamatory about someone, that person will have meaningful recourse in our courts,"" Trump said from the
White House.
The president, who routinely rails against ""fake news"" and has called the federal investigation into Russian
meddling in the 2016 presidential election ""a hoax,"" lambasted people who libel, saying, ""The person that has been
abused, defamed, libeled, will have meaningful recourse.
""Our current libel laws are a sham and a disgrace and do not represent American values or American fairness. We
want fairness. You can't say things that are false, knowingly false, and be able to smile as money pours into your
bank account,"" he continued.
Trump's comments follow the publication of Michael Wolff's book on the early months of the president's
administration, ""Fire and Fury,"" which paints a portrait of the commander in chief as an impulsive manchild
incapable of running the country.
Fact checkers have called Trump's own truthfulness into question, saying he often makes false or misleading
claims.
And at an afternoon news conference with Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg, Trump doubled down on his
claims about special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.
""There has been no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians or Trump and Russians. No collusion.
The Democrats are all running for office and trying to say this, but bottom line, they say there is no collusion. And
there is no collusion,"" Trump said.
Asked if would meet with Mueller, Trump was noncommittal, saying only, ""I'll speak to attorneys.""

If Hillary Clinton had accepted Mayor de Blasio's counsel, she would have lost the popular vote along with the

Why should anyone want to follow a politician who is fighting income inequality from the perch of a taxpayerfunded

How could the voters of New York City have been taken in by a fraud like de Blasio? His assertion that he will be
the leader of the progressive left and his placement of himself among the likes of Henry Ford, Thomas Edison and
Gandhi reveal his ego and delusions of grandeur.
The mayor is nothing but a scam artist, looking to make as much money as he can for himself and his cohorts.
They are turning the students of New York City into idiots. They keep lowering standards instead of improving the
teachers.
They get a lot of help from their bought-and-paid-for unions. As long as the unions keep paying, de Blasio &Co. will
do their bidding.

The mayor needs to know that there are drugs for delusional disorders. People often have grandiose fantasies and
believe themselves to possess talents beyond their intrinsic abilities, but they are treatable.
His view of himself as a progressive savior is in sharp contrast to reality. He was reelected by just 14 percent of
registered voters; not a very compelling endorsement.
His off-putting personality, thin skin and lack of problem-solving skills make him the least attractive person for the
national political stage.

Bank of America and Brookfield Property Partners signed a lease on the eve of the Christmas weekend for the
building's entire 386,000 square feet, sources revealed.
The Post first reported that a deal was in the works on Nov. 21. BofA will move into 1100 Sixth Ave. when HBO
moves to 30 Hudson Yards in 2019, along with parent Time Warner.
BofA, led by Chief Executive Brian Moynihan, plans to keep its Manhattan headquarters at the Durst Organization's
One Bryant Park across the street.
However, the bank also has offices at widely scattered buildings around town, including in Rockefeller Center and
the GM Building at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street. The new space at 1100 Sixth Ave. will allow for staff
consolidation while creating a ""campus"" with the mother ship at One Bryant Park on the other side of the avenue.
The deal is the latest reflection of Midtown Sixth Avenue's office-leasing strength at the same time as the corridor
is enjoying a boom in retail leasing and hotel development.
Brookfield and California's Swig Co. (not to be confused with New York's Swig Equities) bought a long-term
leasehold on 1100 Sixth eight months ago from William H. Nickerson's Eugene A. Hoffman Management.
Nickerson developed the building in 1980.

While President-elect Donald Trump is promising to increase US gross domestic profit to 5 percent to 6 percent from its current 2 percent level, Wall Street banks are forecasting that, at least in its first year, a Trump White House will fall short of its goal.
JPMorgan Chase is predicting a 1.9 growth rate next year. Others are a bit more bullish: Wells Fargo predicts 2.1 percent growth and Goldman Sachs says it will grow at about 2.25 percent.
As for the S&P 500, Wall Street sees the popular index finishing 2017 up just slightly - well below the 9.5 percent gain in 2016 and the 7 percent average gain.
Goldman, Bank of America, UBS and Credit Suisse all predict the S&P 500 will end the year at about 2,300 - only 2.4 percent higher than its 2016 close. JPMorgan is more bullish, forecasting a 7.2 percent rise in the index.
""This American economic expansion has been like a healthy tortoise, ambling slowly but steadily down the road,"" David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, wrote. ""There are signs the tortoise may pick up the pace in 2017.""
As to the actions of the Federal Reserve, almost every major Wall Street bank predicts it will increase rates two or three times next year.
""The market has moved toward our expectation that we'll see three hikes from the Federal Reserve next year,"" Jan Hatzius, Goldman's chief economist, said in a video presentation.
Banks have been notoriously wrong regarding predictions for the Fed's plans, though - most banks forecast that Chair Janet Yellen would raise rates three or four times in 2016.

15-Mar-18,113.2,113.6,109.54,109.95,22550426,chase,"We rank the best places to get income-and the worst-in a rising-rate world. European dividend stocks and utilities look attractive. MLPs, not so much.
Income-oriented investors have plenty of choices going into 2017, following the selloff in the bond market and rate- sensitive areas of the stock market during the second half of 2016.
There now are yields of 3% to 7% on a range of stocks and bonds, including European equities, electric utilities, real estate investment trusts, municipal bonds, master limited partnerships, and junk debt. The opportunities in many cases are as good as or better than at the start of 2016, mostly due to the jump in bond yields following the election of Donald J. Trump in November.
This is Barron's fifth annual assessment of income-producing investments. This time, we?ll take a look at 10 sectors and forecast which offer the best return prospects in the next 12 months.
Our top choice is depressed European stocks, which offer both high yields and appreciation potential. We haven?t focused much on Europe before, but we like to highlight undervalued areas that aren?t getting wide attention. After another year of underperforming their U.S. counterparts, European blue chips, including Nestl? (ticker: NSRGY), Royal Dutch Shell (rDsA), Novartis (NVS), and Unilever (UL) carry yields of 3% to 7%.
In the U.S., electric utilities, real estate investment trusts, municipals bonds, and preferred stock look appealing after a selloff in the second half of 2016. Utilities and REITs generally yield 3% to 4%; munis, 2% to 5%; and preferred stock and junk bonds, 6%. Closed-end funds investing in these sectors often offer even higher yields, thanks to leveraged structures that also magnify risk.
We're less enamored of Treasuries, telecoms, and master limited partnerships. Even after a rise in interest rates, Treasury yields of 1% to 3% aren?t enticing relative to inflation, now running at close to 2%. Telecom shares look more fully valued after a recent rally, while MLPs look rich relative to other incomeproducing areas of the equity market after a 60% rally in the widely followed AMZ index from its February lows.
Changes in tax laws could affect both stocks and bonds. A plan from House Republicans would benefit holders of taxable debt by setting a preferential rate of 16.5% on interest income (half the proposed top income-tax rate of 33%), compared with current rules subjecting this income to an individual?s top marginal rate. Lower income-tax rates could dent demand for municipal bonds.
Last year, we ranked 10 sectors, and our record looks good. Our top choices-junk, high-dividend U.S. stocks, and electric utilities-each returned about 15%. And we weren?t excited about most parts of the bond market, including Treasuries and preferred stocks, given low prevailing yields. We didn?t get it all right, ever. We ranked telecom stocks too low on the list, and we were unenthused by master limited partnerships, which returned about 15% in 2016 after a very rocky start.
What follows is our view of 10 income sectors in order of their appeal.
European Dividend Stocks U.S. equity investors did best staying close to home in 2016, as the S&P 500 rose 9.5%, small and mid-cap indexes gained about 20%, and the major European index, the Stoxx 600, was down 1%.
The European outlook for 2017 looks better, with many European ADRs (American depositary receipts) having finished 2016 in the red, hurt in part by the dollar's rise. Valuations have gotten more reasonable and dividend yields are ample, especially relative to ultralow or even negative yields on European government bonds.
Novartis, for instance, trades for about 14 times estimated 2017 earnings and yields 3.7%. Unilever yields 3.5%, Sanofi (SNY), 4.1%, and Royal Dutch Shell, 6%. Barron's highlighted Novartis and Unilever among ""Our 10 Favorite Stocks for 2017"" (Dec. 3, 2016), and Royal Dutch in a cover story during the summer (""Shell: The Best Big Oil Stock Yields Juicy 6.6%,"" July 16,2016).
The First Trust Stoxx European Select Dividend Income exchange-traded fund (FDD) holds 30 high-dividend stocks that have payout ratios (dividends divided by earnings) of 60% or less; it now yields 4.9%. Its largest holdings are Zurich Insurance Group and Royal Dutch. A broader ETF, the low-fee Vanguard FTSE Europe (VGK), yields 3.5%.
Electric Utilities
Electric companies remain a good spot for income following an 8% pullback in the Utilities Select Sector SpDR (XLU) since its July peak. Utilities trade for an average of 17 times estimated 2017 earnings, which is close to a market multiple. Their average yield of 3.6% is almost double that of the S&P 500. Utility dividends usually are secure, given regulated returns.
""U.S. electric utilities offer better value relative to other defensive industries,"" wrote Morgan Stanley utility analysts in a recent note, citing work by the firm's chief domestic strategist, Adam Parker, that shows utilities have low earnings variability relative to other traditionally defensive industry groups. Reflecting this, Parker argues that utility P/Es ought to be three to four multi- - ple points higher than they are now.
While growth is hardly robust, many utilities are capable of mid-single-digit expansion in earnings per share keyed to new generating facilities and infrastructure spending, with higher-growth utilities like California's Sempra Energy (SRE) targeting 12% annual gains through 2020.
In a recent interview with Barrons.com, John Bartlett, a portfolio manager at Reaves Asset Management, said utilities are better than bonds. While further rate increases likely would be negative, he argued that utilities ""are common stocks and have the ability to grow earnings and dividends so those head winds can be overcome."" Reaves runs several funds, including the Reaves Utility Income fund (UTG), a $1 billion closed-end fund that yields 6.2% (reflecting a leveraged structure) and trades around $31, a 5% discount to its net asset value. Bartlett is partial to California utilities like Sempra and PG&E (PCG) and Michigan's DTE Energy (DTE) due to a favorable regulatory environment. In a low-rate environment, it generally has paid to get income in stocks rather than bonds. That was the case in 2016, as stocks bested bonds by a wide margin-with junk debt the exception. Our view has been that bonds didn't offer enough yield to compensate for the price risk. Investors were reminded of that danger in the second half of 2016, as long-term bond prices fell sharply.
Even after rallying in 2016, high dividend-paying stocks still look appealing. One place to look is the out-of-favor health-care group, where yields are in the 3% to 4% range, including Pfizer (PFE), Merck (MRK), and AbbVie (ABBV). Investors also can get bond-like yields in the consumer sector. Coca-Cola (KO) yields 3.4%; Procter &Gamble (PG), 3.2%; and Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD), 3.3%. Financial stocks don't look as attractive following their late-year run- up. Industry leader JPMorgan Chase (JPM), for example, now yields just 2.2%.
Among the numerous dividend-oriented funds and ETFs, there is the large Vanguard High-Dividend Yield ETF (VYM), which is dominated by megacap dividend payers like Microsoft and Exxon Mobil. The ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL) features companies with a history of 25 years of annual dividend increases, like Nucor and Sysco. (For more on the Dividend Aristocrats, see page 36.)
Junk Bonds
The junk-bond market is coming off its best year since 2012, with 2016 returns at around 15%. That reflected the high average yield of 9% entering the year after a tough 2015, when many energy and commodity bonds were hit.
Junk yields still look good at an average of 6.3%. The interest-rate gap relative to Treasuries is still appealing at nearly 4.5%, but absolute yields are modest by historical standards. ""I think you can get close to a 10% return"" in 2017, says Carl Kaufman, manager of the Osterweis Strategic Income fund (OSTIX), a go-anywhere bond fund with a heavy junk weighting. ""It wouldn't take a lot to get you there. The economic momentum is positive.""
Andy Johnson, a manager of the Neuberger Berman Strategic Income fund (NSTAX), is partial to so-called leveraged loans made to junk-grade companies. These floating-rate loans, pegged to Libor (a key short rate), now yield an average of 5.5% to 5.75%. ""The spread between high-yield debt and loans is very narrow. You're not getting paid for the additional interest-rate risk of high yield"" bonds, he says. Loans are usually the most senior debt of a junk-grade company and carry lower rate risk.
Junk plays include closed-end funds like the BlackRock Corporate High Yield (HYT) and Invesco Dynamic Credit Opportunities (VTA), a leveraged loan fund, and ETFs like the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond (JNK).
Municipal Bonds
Munis are looking better after a disappointing 2016, when total returns were roughly flat as interest income offset modest price declines on intermediate and long-term debt. Yields generally rose V to % percentage point. Triple- Arated 10-year debt now yields about 2.4%, and 30-year triple-A debt, 3.15%.
Lower-rated debt yields more. Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's long-term debt, with double-A ratings, yields about 3.5% assuming an early redemption in about 10 years. New Jersey's financial woes cost the state in December when the New Jersey State Economic Development Authority sold $900 million of debt and paid a rate of more than 5% for 25year debt. There are a lot of tax uncertainties in 2017, notably whether the top income tax rate will be cut to 33% from 39.6%, modestly reducing the appeal of munis. And munis could get more competition from corporate bonds, Treasuries, and mortgage securities if taxes on interest income on taxable debt are reduced.
The tax changes, however, seem to be reflected in the market, with top-rated munis trading at about the same yield as Treasuries. ""I expect a lot of volatility and uncertainty given the new administration,"" says Alan Schankel, muni analyst at Janney Capital Markets. He's partial to transportation debt for turnpikes and airports.
Muni plays include higher-yielding leveraged closed-end funds like the Nuveen Quality Municipal Income (NAD) yielding 5.5% and the BlackRock Municipal 2030 Target Term Trust (BTT), yielding 4.4% with windup date in 2030- an appealing feature that makes the fund more like a bond. Vanguard Intermediate Term Tax Exempt (VWIUX), the industry's largest open-end fund, yields 2.9%, and Pimco High-Yield Municipal Bond (PHMIX) yields 4.2%.
Real Estate Investment Trusts
After making a nearly complete round trip in 2016, the sector looks good, with an average yield of 4% and reasonable growth prospects in 2017 and 2018. Adjusted funds from operations, a key REIT financial measure, are expected to show an average increase in the mid-single-digits in 2017.
REITs now are on the inexpensive side of a fair-value range as calculated by Green Street Advisors, the Newport Beach, Calif., real estate research firm. REITs also look good versus private-market transactions. One way to gauge this is to look at implied capitalization rates for major REITs like Boston Properties (BXP), Equity Residential (EQR), and Simon Property Group (SPG), which now are 5% or higher. The cap rate is what an unleveraged investor would earn owning each company's assets. Cap rates for private transactions involving top malls, office buildings, and apartments often are in the 4% range. A lower cap rate translates into a higher price.
Mall REITs have been weak lately, as investors start to discount the death of malls at the hands of e-commerce. Industry leader Simon Property hit a 52-week low of $173 last week; it yields 3.8%. The bull case for the mall REITs is that they hold prime properties that should be largely immune from Internet retailing threat. Simon Property's funds from operations, an industry cash-flow measure, are expected to rise a healthy 8% in 2017 and its valuation has contracted. Boston Properties arguably is the top office REIT and trades at a marked discount to its estimated private market value. The Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ) returned about 7% in 2016 and yields more than 4%.
Preferred Stock
With yields up about a percentage point from summer lows, to around 6% on many leading bank preferreds, the sector looks more attractive. Preferred yields are almost double the rate on long-term Treasuries-a nice spread given the rising security of preferred dividends amid stronger bank earnings and capital positions. Banks are the leading preferred issuers.
The main negative is interest-rate risk. Most preferreds have long maturities or are perpetual, making them very sensitive to rate changes. Some have fallen 15% in price since the bond-market peak in July. Preferreds generally are callable in five years at face value, normally $25. The combination of perpetual maturities and five-year calls favors issuers and disadvantages investors. Since preferred is equity, dividends are typically taxed preferentially like common stock dividends, although REIT preferreds are an exception. Liquidity usually is good because preferred trades like stock on exchanges, usually the New York Stock Exchange. It often pays to buy preferred at a discount from face value to reduce redemption risk and create a more attractive risk/reward. Wells Fargo's series X issue, for instance, has a 5.5% dividend rate and trades around $22.70 (with a face value of $25) for a yield of 6.1%. Public Storage's 4.9% issue (series E) trades around $21, for a yield of 5.80%.
One unusual high-rate bank convertible issue, the Bank of America 7.25% Series L, is appealing. It trades above its face value of $1,000 but can't be converted unless the common stock more than doubles from the current $22. And even in a redemption scenario, it can only be called at a 30% premium above $1,000, pros say.
The largest sector ETF, iShares US Preferred Stock (PFF), yields almost 6%. And there are several preferred- oriented closedend funds, like the Nuveen Preferred &Income Term fund (JPI), that yield more. The Nuveen fund yields 8.5%, reflecting leverage, and has an attractive wind-up-date feature with a scheduled maturity in 2024.
Treasuries
The one-percentage point rate rise in the second half of 2016 turned a great year into a mediocre one, as the two leading ETFs, the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (TLT) and iShares 7-10 Year Treasury (IEF), both returned 1% for the year. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities did better, with the iShares TIPS Bond (TIP) ETF returning about 4% amid rising inflation expectations. If Trump's fiscal and economic policies prove inflationary, Treasuries are apt to suffer. TIPS offer a hedge against higher inflation, although they likely would drop in a bond bear market.
Telecom
The two main telecom stocks, AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ), are coming off a strong 2016 when AT&T returned 30% and Verizon 21%. Neither is expensive now. Verizon, at $53, changes hands at 13 times projected 2017 earnings and yields 4.3%. AT&T, at $42, has a 2017 P/E of 14 and a yield of 4.6%. There may, however, be better values in other high-yielding parts of the stock market and in overseas telecom issues. The U.S. wireless market remains very competitive, with little or no revenue growth projected in 2017 for the top companies amid inroads by T-Mobile US and Sprint, which offer lower-cost plans.
AT&T will be focused in 2017 in trying to get antitrust approval for its $85 billion deal for Time Warner and the rollout of its lowcost, $35-a-month TV offering. Verizon is expected to buy Yahoo's core business, and there is speculation that the company may look at an even bigger target: Charter Communications, the No. 2 cable outfit.
Alternatives to the major U.S. telecoms include Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), which holds a valuable stake in T- Mobile and yields 3.7%. Vodafone Group (VOD), yields 6.1%.
Master Limited Partnerships
Energy infrastructure MLPs recovered from sharp early-year losses to finish 2016 with a total return of 15%, as the industry stabilized amid higher oil and natural-gas prices.
MLP yields remain elevated with the Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP) yielding more than 7%, comfortably exceeding those of electric utilities and REITs. But distribution growth is moderating, leverage remains high at many companies and valuations are expensive based on enterprise value/cash flow. MLPs trade for around 15 times 2017 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda), versus about 10 for utilities and seven for Verizon and AT&T.
""We expect muted distribution growth from most MLPs, given the rising cost of capital and leverage,"" wrote JPMorgan analysts last month. The firm sees most of 26 MLPs it covers generating annualized distribution growth of 5% or less over the coming three years, with nearly half at 2% or less. Enterprise Products Partners (EPD), a laggard in 2016, remains an industry leader with a strong pipeline network and a yield of 6%. Boardwalk Pipeline Partners (BWP) has a conservative distribution policy, yielding just 2%. But it could boost its payout in 2018, when major construction projects end. *

The appointment, which was announced in an internal email on New Years Day by Cantors chairman and chief executive, Howard Lutnick, comes 18 months after Mr. Jain resigned under pressure from his job as co-chief
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 12 of 2571
executive of Germanys largest bank as concerns mounted over Deutsches financial health and the many investigations it was facing. A Cantor spokeswoman confirmed the appointment on Monday.
Mr. Jain, 53, was among a small group of Merrill Lynch executives who were persuaded to join Deutsche in 1995, with a mandate to build an investment bank that would challenge large firms like Barclays, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.
Deutsches global markets division would do exactly that during its first 10 years in existence, becoming a market leader in derivatives, fixed income and foreign currency sales and trading.
But its hard-charging culture of pursuing profits and risk and paying its bankers and traders magnificent sums along the way proved to be the divisions undoing in the years after the financial crisis.
Deutsche Bank became one of the primary targets of regulators worldwide, and it was penalized as a primary offender in two of the largest financial scandals of the era selling toxic mortgages to investors and manipulating for profit benchmark interest rates in London.
Many other businesses at Deutsche that Mr. Jain had broad oversight for have paid penalties or are under investigation for charges that include misstating derivatives positions and money laundering activities in Russia.
As group president, Mr. Jain will, in effect, become a partner to Mr. Lutnick, helping him oversee Cantors various businesses and, crucially, providing strategic insights. According to a Cantor spokeswoman, Mr. Jain will not have a group of executives reporting to him. Instead, he will strategize and engage with clients at a senior level.
Mr. Lutnick called the hiring of Mr. Jain a strong next step in broadening our franchise.
He will work alongside me as my partner as we expand our global footprint and drive the firms momentum, Mr. Lutnick said.
The two men have been friends for years and have on occasion even spent vacations together.
People who know Mr. Jain well say they are not surprised that he would soon return to the front lines of finance. From an early point in his career, he had seen himself as a Wall Street chief executive in the classic style of wielding unchallenged power and influence.
Deutsche was the focus of that dream, and along the way, he declined many offers to leave and join rival banks.
But his three-year tenure as the banks leader was marked by repeated setbacks in a new environment that favored financial rectitude, damaging the reputations of both Deutsche and Mr. Jain.
Although his successor, John Cryan, has kept in place the basic structure of the investment bank that Mr. Jain helped form, he has said that Deutsche will be a different institution, culturally and ethically, under him.
In many ways, becoming president of Cantor Fitzgerald will be a step down of sorts for Mr. Jain.
A private company with an expertise in trading fixed-income securities and servicing hedge funds, Cantor is not the global colossus that Deutsche was during its heyday or is even today in its diminished form.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 13 of 2571

Born in India, Mr. Jain built his reputation at Deutsche on his expertise in selling complex, high-margin securities to hedge funds and other risk-loving investors. In that regard, his talents will be a good fit for Cantors trading and hedge fund businesses.
There may be questions, however, about Mr. Jains capacity to serve for a long period as a No. 2 executive. He has always seen himself as having chief executive timber and has a history of champing at the bit when it comes to waiting for the top job, as he did with Josef Ackermann, who was chief executive of Deutsche from 2002 to 2012.
Mr. Lutnick is a strong-willed leader who has been chairman of the firm since 1996. He became well known for his efforts to keep his firm going after it lost about two thirds of its employees during the attacks of Sept. 11. Cantor had its offices on the top floors of the World Trade Centers north tower.

5-Mar-18,115.1,115.45,113.3,114.53,13214919,chase,"JAKARTA[euro]""Indonesia's government has cut its business partnerships with J.P. Morgan Chase &Co., saying the bank's recent rating downgrade of the nation's stocks, based in part on Donald Trump's U.S. election win, could destabilize Indonesia's financial system.
J.P. Morgan had multiple business partnerships with the government of Southeast Asia's largest economy, including acting as one of several banks appointed to receive penalty payments from Indonesians in a tax-amnesty program aimed at boosting funding for President Joko Widodo's ambitious infrastructure projects. J.P. Morgan is one of the largest foreign banks operating in Indonesia.
In a letter announcing the decision, the Finance Ministry's treasury directorate general said that, effective Jan. 1, it was ending all partnerships with J.P. Morgan because of the bank's research that the government said could disturb the stability of the country's financial system.
In a Nov. 13 report about the global repercussions of Mr. Trump's victory, J.P. Morgan downgraded its rating on Indonesian equities to underweight from overweight, noting that a rise in bond-market volatility ""increases emerging-market risk premiums"" and ""potentially stops/reverses flows into emerging-market fixed income.""
""There are losers from Trumponomics,"" the report said. An underweight rating means the bank expects an investment to underperform others over the next six to 12 months. The bank also downgraded Turkish equities to underweight and Brazil to neutral.
J.P. Morgan will also no longer act as a government-appointed primary dealer in government domestic bond auctions, nor as a panelist for Indonesia's global dollar-bond offerings, Robert Pakpahan, Indonesia's director general of budget financing and risk management, said Tuesday. The bank's research wasn't credible and accurate, he said.
""We don't close ourselves to assessment because it's important for us to improve ourselves,"" Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said. ""But the institutions with big names have very high responsibility in creating positive psychology instead of doing [something] misleading.""
J.P. Morgan declined to comment on Indonesia's views.
The bank said its business in Indonesia continues to operate as usual and that the effect on clients is minimal. It said it is working with the Finance Ministry to resolve the issue.
J.P. Morgan has worked on six debt-capital-markets deals for the Indonesian government since 2012 worth $13.7 billion, including a $3.4 billion deal it worked on with other banks in June last year, according to Dealogic.
On Nov. 14, the day after J.P. Morgan's report was issued, the yield on Indonesia's 10-year government bond shot up 0.466 percentage point, its biggest intraday jump since January 2011, to 7.895%. Yields rise as prices fall.
The moves came amid a sharp selloff in government bonds around the globe after Mr. Trump's Nov. 8 victory, which bruised emerging markets. Foreign investors sold $1 billion worth of Indonesian debt in just one week after the election, about 13% of net inflows for the entire year at that point.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 16 of 2571
Mr. Trump's victory triggered a selloff especially in emerging-market stocks and bonds, with investors pushing up U.S. stocks and Treasury yields on the president-elect's plans for tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending. In Indonesia, the local stock market has lost almost 4% of its value since the election, while the rupiah has slid 3% against the U.S. dollar. In the fourth quarter last year, foreigners sold a net $2.8 billion in stocks and bonds.
Harry Su, an analyst with Bahana Securities in Jakarta, said he has mixed feelings about the report and the government's decision. ""I think the government expects greater support and a more balanced report from its partners,"" he said. But he added, ""Negative feedback also provides a positive warning system for the government.""
Indonesia is a $900 billion economy that has been growing at 5% or better in recent years. Ms. Mulyani, a former managing director for the World Bank, took over the Finance Ministry last year amid efforts by President Widodo to inject changes and fresh credibility into an economy that he says could be growing 7% a year by 2019.[euro]Z
Ms. Mulyani has been attempting to bring more credibility to the Finance Ministry, including by cutting spending and implementing reforms to increase tax collection.

5-Mar-18,115.34,116.6015,115.34,115.44,19888948,chase,"It's Z-Day for East Midtown. The stakes couldn't be higher for the proposal to rezone the iconic but declining Grand Central-area office district, which is expected to begin the city's formal land-use review process on Tuesday after years of false starts.
Rezoning to allow large, modern new buildings to rise is critical to saving the 73-block district from galloping obsolescence. Existing buildings, hobbled by ancient infrastructure unsuited to today's digitally attuned companies, are an average 70 years old, mainly because 1961 zoning rules made replacing them near-impossible. Freeing the area from the straitjacket could restore its allure to companies needing 21st-century bells and whistles.
""It's critical for East Midtown's viability,"" said law firm Fried, Frank's real estate chairman, Jonathan Mechanic. ""It will no longer deteriorate, but will again become the central business district that New York City needs.""
If the Department of City Planning measure survives the seven-month Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, which requires approval by the City Council and the mayor, it will bring a net increase over 20 years of more than 6 million square feet of office space to the district's current 90 million square feet, the DCP projects.
But the area will gain more than 15 million square feet of modern, state-of-the-art space because some old buildings will be torn down for new ones.
Rezoning's fate is being closely followed by landlords who want the option to redevelop older properties - among them, publicly traded SL Green, Vornado and Brookfield; privately held Rudin Management and the Durst Organization; and companies that own their office towers such as JPMorgan Chase and Pfizer.
City planners say rezoning will add nearly $800 million of upgrades to subway stations and above-ground streetscapes without costing taxpayers a dime.
That's because, in order to put up larger new buildings, developers in designated ""transit zones"" must pay for and build the subway improvements at six Midtown stations.
Plus, sellers of air rights must donate a portion of sale values to a ""public realm"" fund that will pay for sidewalk- level upgrades.
The old zoning is so restrictive that East Midtown buildings that were constructed before 1961 can't legally be replaced by new buildings even of the same size.
An overdue but unpopular attempt to rezone the area under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg was yanked in 2013. It failed to spell out what transit upgrades developers would have to deliver.
Owners of landmarks such as Grand Central Terminal and houses of worship couldn't sell air rights except to next- door sites that weren't suitable for development.
The new plan gets rid of those weaknesses.
City Planning Commissioner Carl Weisbrod led the team effort, but a source noted, ""It couldn't have happened without enthusiastic participation by [Manhattan Borough President] Gale Brewer and [Council member] Dan Garodnick"" - both of whom opposed the earlier proposal, but recognized the need for change.
The city rezoned one important but small slice of the area in 2014 - Vanderbilt Avenue, where SL Green's One Vanderbilt is rising next to Grand Central Terminal.
But the new, much more ambitious proposal covers roughly from East 39th to East 57th streets, and from Third to Fifth avenues.
A draft environmental impact statement posted online over the weekend spells out its key provisions.
It would increase permissible new building size from today's mostly 12 to 15 ""floor-to-area ratio"" (FAR) - the measure of how much floor space can be built on a lot of a particular size - to as much as 18 FAR in some parts of the district and up to 27 FAR in others.
However, the current ""base"" FAR limits won't change. To add to them, developers in the ""transit zones"" can only gain additional FAR by paying for, and constructing, new facilities specified by the MTA at six subway stations.
At the Fifth Avenue/53d Street E and M stop, for example, they include a new Madison Avenue street entrance and
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 19 of 2571
a new mezzanine.
In other parts of East Midtown, developers could raise FAR only by buying unused air rights from owners of landmarks throughout the district, not only from those next door. Sellers would donate 20 percent of the sale price to a ""public-realm fund"" for sidewalk-level improvements, to be run by a panel of mayoral appointees and community stakeholders.
The city must receive a minimum $78 per square foot on each transaction - a figure that values the average prospective air-rights sale at nearly $400 per square foot.
The public-realm fund would also collect a fee from owners of older buildings wishing to replace them with new ones of the same size, but larger than 1961 rules allowed.
Change can't come too soon. ""Important companies have been relocating to areas that are able to have modern, 21st Century buildings - especially to Hudson Yards and the World Trade Center,"" warned CBRE tristate CEO Mary Ann Tighe.
BlackRock, Wells Fargo, Point72 and several major law firms have already moved out or plan to.
Rudin Management Company co-vice chairman and CEO William Rudin told The Post, ""The prospect of passage of rezoning in 2017 is critically important to maintaining New York as a global capital and will send a message to the world regarding the development potential for Midtown.""

26-Feb-18,115.87,116,114.83,115.24,8747977,chase,"When a Wall Street banking institution starts throwing 100,000-point bonuses at credit card customers, it may be best to grab them before they inevitably disappear. And so it goes with Chase Sapphire Reserve , a card that the bank, JPMorgan Chase, introduced last summer. The bank offered a sign-up bonus worth $1,500 to people who spent $4,000 on the card in the first three months they had it and then redeemed the bonus for travel.
Now the bank is cutting the bonus in half. Jan. 12 will be the last day that people can earn it by applying for the card online, though people who apply at a bank branch will still be able to get the bonus until March 12. You need not be a current bank customer to apply at a branch, according to a bank spokeswoman, Ashley E. Dodd, who confirmed the changes.
The bonus played a big role in bringing the card so much attention, landing it on the cover of Bloomberg Businessweek and leading the bank to hand out so many perks that it caused a $200 million to $300 million hit to its earnings .
Even without the outsize bonus, which was very rare in the history of credit card bonus offers, the card is likely to remain popular. While it has a steep $450 annual fee, cardholders receive a $300 credit each year for any travel

spending they put on the card. And customers earn three points for every dollar they spend on all travel and dining, which can lead to better value than the rewards that most other cards offer for customers who spent a lot in those areas.
The Points Guy blog first reported the slashing of the sign-up bonus. Many such sites now exist to help consumers take advantage of the most lucrative sign-up offers, while collecting commissions when they pass readers on to card issuers application sites.
If those customers keep the cards for a few years (and especially if they run up balances and pay interest), the banks can come out ahead. With too many people gaming the offer, however, bank profitability can suffer, especially when the sign-up bonuses are so large that they attract hordes of freebie-seeking consumers.

26-Feb-18,116.56,116.59,114.6,114.95,12905124,chase,"The Wall Street lawyer Walter J. Clayton does not travel in political circles, nor is he well known in corporate America. He is the insiders insider a deal maker.
As such, his nomination to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission is a strong signal that financial regulation in the Trump administration will emphasize helping companies raise capital in the public markets over tightening regulation. In contrast, the agencys two chairwomen under President Obama had regulatory or enforcement backgrounds.
Mr. Clayton, known as Jay, has spent nearly his entire career in corporate boardrooms. His regulatory experience stems from advising banks on dealings with the government and helping several financial institutions with their settlements related to mortgage securities.
He had a front-row seat to the financial crisis, advising Barclays Capital in buying the assets of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers in 2008 and Bear Stearns in its fire sale to JPMorgan Chase in 2007. He has advised on mergers and initial public offerings, including the biggest ever, the $25 billion offering by Alibaba Group of China in 2013.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 23 of 2571
If Mr. Clayton is confirmed, he may have to recuse himself from some matters. A similar scrutiny was applied to Mary Jo White, the agencys current chairwoman. She had been a litigator at Debevoise &Plimpton, where her clients included JPMorgan Chase, Rupert Murdochs News Corporation and Kenneth D. Lewis, a former Bank of America chief executive.
Still, such recusals are not unusual. Laura S. Unger, a former commissioner and acting chairwoman, said that during her tenure, she had to recuse herself from a number of matters before the commission. She said the process of deciding when to recuse oneself often took place in consultation with the commissions ethics officer.
An ethics officer at the S.E.C. knows all of your intimate details, and the ethics officer flags for you what may be potential conflicts, she noted.
Yet Mr. Claytons nomination will be sure to fuel criticism that Goldman Sachs could wield too much influence in the Trump administration. Sullivan &Cromwell, where Mr. Clayton is a partner, has been Goldmans go-to law firm for more than a century. Mr. Clayton advised Goldman Sachs on perhaps its most important deal, the $5 billion investment by Warren E. Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway amid the financial crisis. Mr. Claytons wife works as a private-wealth adviser at Goldman.
The S.E.C. nomination follows the appointment of Goldmans No. 2 executive, Gary D. Cohn , to be the top economic policy adviser to president-elect Donald J. Trump , and the selection of a hedge fund manager who was a former Goldman trader, Steven T. Mnuchin , to be Treasury secretary. Mr. Trumps chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, is a former Goldman banker. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump had repeatedly criticized Goldman Sachs as an emblem of a financial elite.
Mr. Trump, who met with Mr. Clayton on Dec. 22, said in a statement that the lawyer will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time.
Mr. Clayton is expected to face scrutiny on his confirmation as a Sullivan &Cromwell colleague, H. Rodgin Cohen, did in 2009. Mr. Cohen, the dean of Wall Street lawyers, withdrew his name from consideration for a senior Treasury role amid an outcry over his deep involvement in nearly all the bank deals struck during the financial crisis.
Its hard to see how an attorney who spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep President-elect Trumps promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from getting away with murder, Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said. I look forward to hearing how Mr. Clayton will protect retirees and savers from being exploited, demand real accountability from financial institutions the S.E.C. oversees and work to prevent another financial crisis.
One issue could be Mr. Claytons representation of Alibaba. The Chinese e-commerce giant is under investigation by the S.E.C. over its accounting practices.
Mr. Clayton also represented Och-Ziff Capital Management in its $1.2 billion initial public offering a decade ago, and subsequent offerings and financing. A unit of the New York-based hedge fund pleaded guilty for what federal prosecutors said were more than $100 million in bribes paid to officials in African countries. The hedge fund was forced to pay a $400 million settlement. Government authorities said in September that they were still investigating individuals related to case.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 24 of 2571

Another issue could be a 2011 report critical of the governments enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which argued that the current anti-bribery regime was causing lasting harm to the competitiveness of U.S. regulated companies and the U.S. capital markets. Mr. Clayton was the chairman of the New York City bar association committee that drafted the report.
Requests to speak with Mr. Clayton at Sullivan &Cromwell were not answered.
A number of fellow deal lawyers said they were glad that the 50-year-old practitioner could be at the helm of the S.E.C.
Hes a very smart, pragmatic guy who has real deal experience and has seen this stuff firsthand, said Richard Truesdell, a head of Davis Polks global capital markets group, who has worked with Mr. Clayton on several deals. Theres been a lot of buzz today, and I have yet to talk to anyone who isnt pleasantly surprised by the choice.
The role of the Securities and Exchange Commission is to protect investors and enable companies to raise capital through the public markets in a way that fosters economic growth.
The latter is a key tenet of Mr. Trumps economic plan, with the aim that companies can use the excess capital to create jobs.
Harvey Pitt, a former chairman of the S.E.C. appointed by President George W. Bush, said Mr. Clayton was a high- quality appointment.
It is especially logical with respect to the agencys obligation to promote capital formation, a subject with which the incoming administration is appropriately concerned, said Mr. Pitt in an email. Mr. Claytons background is very impressive both for the depth of his experience, and for the quality of his efforts.
Mr. Clayton went to the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Cambridge for separate bachelors degrees and then obtained his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School.
Mr. Clayton donated to Mitt Romney and Mr. Obama in previous presidential elections and to Jeb Bushs primary campaign in 2015, according to public records.
Those who know Mr. Clayton describe him as the roll-up-his-sleeves type, a doer who is often in the shadows of the better known Mr. Cohen at Sullivan &Cromwell.
When I think about the position, the guy has a really deep understanding of the capital markets and financial regulatory matters, so he checks those boxes, said Brad Whitman, vice chairman in mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley, who has worked with Mr. Clayton over many years. Hes got a great appreciation for what drives business and growth.

On Thursday, federal regulators announced a $5 million settlement with Jon S. Corzine , who ran MF Global when it collapsed into bankruptcy in 2011 and lost more than $1 billion in customer money. The settlement, reached unanimously at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the waning days of the Obama administration and approved by a federal judge this week, caps a long-running spectacle that derailed Mr. Corzines career and spurred a number of congressional, criminal and regulatory investigations.
The regulatory case arose in 2013, when the commodities agency sued Mr. Corzine, a Democratic former New Jersey senator and governor, saying he had failed to diligently supervise the firm as it jeopardized the clients accounts.
The agency did not directly link Mr. Corzine, 70, to the missing money, but it did accuse a lower-level employee in Chicago, Edith OBrien, of aiding and abetting the misuse of customer money, saying she allowed it to be used to
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 31 of 2571
plug holes in MF Globals own accounts.
To resolve the case, Mr. Corzine has agreed to pay the $5 million penalty out of his own pocket. While the sum is manageable for someone who reaped many millions of dollars as a top Goldman Sachs executive before pursuing a career in politics, it is an unusual step. In other federal cases involving Wall Street, insurance money often covers settlement amounts, sparing the executives themselves.
While Mr. Corzine was willing to settle the case, Ms. OBrien nearly took it to trial. But in recent weeks she, too, agreed to settle, striking a deal that has imposed a $500,000 penalty and an 18-month prohibition on her associating with a futures broker like MF Global.
Mr. Corzine agreed to a harsher undertaking accepting a lifetime prohibition from leading a futures broker or registering with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In effect, that means he will not personally trade other peoples money in the futures industry, except for smaller trades under certain threshold limits. Mr. Corzine, in theory, could still operate a hedge fund that does futures trading, and he could trade for his own account. The settlement also does not prevent him from trading in other markets.
This resolution demonstrates the importance that the commission attaches to customer protection, which has long been a hallmark of our mission, Aitan Goelman, the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission enforcement division, said in a statement announcing the settlement.
The settlements, the contours of which were reported by The New York Times in October , bring a long-sought close to the MF Global ordeal.
The criminal investigations ended with the conclusion that MF Global employees did not intentionally break the law. Just last year, Mr. Corzine settled much of the private MF Global litigation. And a trustee has long recovered the missing customer money (much of it wound up at MF Globals banks and clearinghouses) and made whole the farmers and hedge funds whose accounts were raided in the firms final days.
In a statement on Thursday, Mr. Corzine said, As the C.E.O. of MF Global in 2011, I have accepted responsibility for its failure, and I deeply regret the impact it had on customers, employees, shareholders and others. He added: I remain gratified that several years ago all customer money was recovered and returned to MF Global customers.
His lawyer, Andrew J. Levander, said: Mr. Corzine has given more than 10 days of testimony under oath, and these matters have been investigated exhaustively by two U.S. attorneys offices, the F.B.I., the S.E.C., the C.F.T.C., Finra and Congress. (Finra is the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.)
And yet, Mr. Levander said, None of these investigations have led to allegations that Mr. Corzine engaged in any kind of intentional misconduct or fraud, or that he was at any time not truthful in his many hours of testimony.
The case also concludes a long-running political challenge for the commodities agency, which came under fire for not preventing a breach of customer money at a firm it regulated. Compounding the pressure, Mr. Corzine was a sensitive target, a prominent Democrat who has been a confidant of leaders in Washington and on Wall Street.
Against that backdrop, the agency extracted the $5 million payout from Mr. Corzine, a sum far greater than what it could have expected to win if he had been found liable at trial. During negotiations with Mr. Corzine last year, the
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 32 of 2571

commission also strengthened aspects of the deal after some of the agencys commissioners questioned it, The New York Times reported at the time.
The case against Mr. Corzine was among the agencys biggest enforcement actions in the Obama administration. And after MF Globals demise, on Halloween in 2011, the commodities agency used the episode to tighten the rules for protecting customer money.
The disappearance of the money from MF Global unnerved the futures industry and raised broader concerns about the safety of customer funds across Wall Street. Further review showed that MF Globals financial straits left it vulnerable to a breach.
Mr. Corzine joined MF Global as chief executive and chairman in 2010 after the firm had lost money in each of the previous three years. In hopes of returning the firm to profitability and perhaps transforming it into a miniature Goldman Sachs Mr. Corzine placed a large wager on European sovereign debt at a time when investors feared defaults in the eurozone.
Although his bet ultimately would have been profitable for MF Global, and the European bonds paid out for other firms that bought the debt, it was not enough to save the firm from unrelated woes. MF Globals auditor, for example, made the firm write down the value of a significant future tax benefit, a move that appeared to unnerve MF Globals investors as well as ratings agencies. And after a series of ratings downgrades, the firm started to unravel.
In MF Globals final days, it overdrew an account at JPMorgan Chase, one of its banks, and scrambled to patch that hole. That is when the improper transfers of customer money accelerated, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commissions complaint.
Minutes after learning of the overdrawn account, Mr. Corzine told Ms. OBrien that meeting the banks demands was the most important thing she could get done that day.
Ultimately, in the chaos and confusion of those final days, customer money was transferred to JPMorgan.
And yet, Mr. Corzine was not accused of instructing Ms. OBrien to use customer money for this purpose. According to court records submitted by his lawyers, Mr. Corzine was not told that the firm was at risk of violating the rules until the eve of the bankruptcy, after the breach had happened.
In an email, Ms. OBrien told Mr. Corzine that the transfer to JPMorgan was a house wire, meaning it came from the firms accounts.
In the years since, Mr. Corzine has visited Central America for a humanitarian project and has traded with his own money. His philanthropic efforts have included working with Covenant House, a nonprofit focused on helping homeless children.
With this matter resolved, he said, I am eager to move forward and plan to spend my time focused on issues that have always been important in my life: my family, community and philanthropic causes, and markets.

7-Mar-18,115.11,115.23,113.21,114.74,11173721,chase,"Warren E. Buffett recently revealed a willingness to invest in airlines after years of shunning them, and ever since, those stocks have soared. Now, one more company is aiming to be added to the list of publicly traded airlines.
Frontier Airlines known for offering scant legroom and low prices for rides on planes that have wild animals painted on the tails is preparing an initial public offering, people with knowledge of the deal said. The Denver- based company has tapped Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase and Evercore to manage the debut, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing private information.
Frontier is aiming to raise about $500 million in the deal, the people said. That would imply a valuation for the company of about $2 billion. Frontier had an official bake off, where banks were interviewed for a role in the offering, late last year, one of the people said.
Like the history of many airlines, Frontiers is winding. The airline was founded in the 1990s after Continental Airlines shuttered its Denver hub. It has reorganized and gone through bankruptcy and has had several owners. The latest owner is the investment firm Indigo Partners, which is run by Bill Franke, who is credited with being the chairman who turned around Spirit Airlines, another no-frills airline. He has been shifting Frontier toward the Spirit model.
About a year ago, David Siegel resigned as chief executive of Frontier after the government said the airline had the highest complaint rate and worst on-time performance of the major American airlines. Tickets to fly on Frontier are inexpensive, but the carrier adds other costs on top, such as charges for soda, coffee, tea and juice, as well as for carry-on bags. Choosing a seat in advance also requires a fee, as does reserving one with more legroom. Passengers can choose to pay for a bundled ticket, which is more expensive but minimizes extra charges.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 35 of 2571
Such no-frills models have proven a profitable way to go, especially for airlines competing with larger American carriers that have undergone rampant consolidation over the past decade. Frontier has also been capitalizing on low fuel prices, which has enabled it to expand its fleet.
But if Frontier does go public, it may not stay an independent company for long.
As an aside, dont we all wonder just how long it will take before the three to five lower-cost airlines in the States will consolidate? Mr. Franke said at a conference a few years ago in Dublin, according to a report by Reuters.
Mr. Franke could be described as an airline legend. In addition to being the chairman of Frontier, he is the managing partner of Indigo, a private-equity firm focused on transportation. He also served as the chairman and chief executive of America West Airlines.
Spirit Airlines has enjoyed a remarkable year of trading in the stock market. Its shares have jumped 45 percent, and the company commands a market valuation of $4 billion.
While Spirit was not among the airlines that Mr. Buffett chose to invest in, shares of those companies have also climbed.
Since it became public in mid-November that Mr. Buffett had taken stakes in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Continental Holdings and Southwest Airlines, shares of each of them gained at least 6.9 percent.
Because Frontier is currently privately held and its I.P.O. prospectus has not been filed, its financials are not disclosed. But The Wall Street Journal reported last year that the company generated $129 million of profit in 2014 .
If the company is still profitable, that may be enticing to investors who have seen little in the way of new issues over the last few years. In 2016, there were fewer initial offerings listed on American exchanges than in any year since 2009.
A representative of Frontier Airlines declined to comment. Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and Evercore declined to comment. Bloomberg News has previously reported that Frontier was planning a public offering.
If there is anything Mr. Buffett has disliked more than airlines over the years, it is I.P.O.s. So his participation is unlikely if and when the shares begin trading.

2-Mar-18,113.75,115.1,113.11,114.73,13006514,chase,"The deal-making president-elect has nominated another deal maker to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The nomination of Walter J. Clayton , a partner at Sullivan &Cromwell, indicates that Donald J. Trumps administration is likely to emphasize helping companies raise capital rather than tighten regulations.
Mr. Clayton, who is known as Jay, had a front-row seat to the financial crisis, advising Barclays Capital in buying the assets of the bankrupt lender Lehman Brothers, and Bear Stearns in its fire sale to JPMorgan Chase.
His colleague, H. Rodgin Cohen, withdrew his name from consideration for a senior Treasury role in 2009 amid an outcry over his involvement in nearly all the bank deals struck during the financial crisis. Mr. Clayton is expected to face similar scrutiny on his confirmation.
Sullivan &Cromwell has also been the go-to law firm for Goldman Sachs, which Mr. Clayton advised on a $5 billion investment by Berkshire Hathaway. This is likely to fuel criticism that Goldman Sachs wields too much influence in the administration.
But some are pleased with the choice.
Mr. Clayton is viewed as a pragmatic man with experience and knowledge of financial regulatory matters. Brad Whitman, vice chairman in mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley, said the nominee had a great appreciation for what drives business and growth.
This could be useful because Federal Reserve officials, optimistic as they are about economic growth, see little chance of the boom that Mr. Trump promised.
This is partly because they plan to raise interest rates if growth accelerates. Still, they are waiting to see what the next administration holds.
Accounts of their last meeting said officials were not yet ready to predict how the pace of rate increases might change as a result of new policies pursued by Mr. Trump and Congress.
Women and minorities made small and slow gains in numbers at major American law firms last year, according to the National Association for Law Placement.
James G. Leipold, executive director of the association, noted that larger firms achieved more diversity than
  PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 38 of 2571
smaller firms. However, the incredibly slow pace of change continues to be discouraging.
The increase in minority lawyers was linked to a greater number of Asian lawyers in associate ranks. The proportion of Hispanic lawyers also edged up.
These levels of representation did, however, evaporated when it came to permanent jobs, indicating that law firms still struggled to retain and promote them.

2-Mar-18,115.64,115.82,114.32,115.16,10674360,chase,"While many of us werent paying attention, some credit card sign-up bonuses became so eye-poppingly large that the analysts at Bernstein Research wondered in November if the industry was afflicted with temporary insanity.
One particular bit of madness a Chase offer that effectively puts $1,500 in your pocket without a lot of effort, if you are a relatively big spender is close to ending, and many people have just a few more days to take advantage of it.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 40 of 2571
But the mere existence of four-figure bonuses on top of the points and perks that come with everyday spending raises a number of questions for consumers.
Even if you thought you had had enough of card-hopping to get the best deals, shouldnt you at least grab those 15 100-dollar bills if you have the means? Or might the offers actually get better? And is it time to bet against the stocks of the maniac bankers who are tossing around offers like this?
CHASE, TODAY? First things first: That giant bonus comes from the Chase Sapphire Reserve card. Heres how it works (and dont confuse it with the similarly named Preferred card): If the bank accepts your application, you have three months to spend $4,000. Once you do, Chase hands over 100,000 of its proprietary rewards points. Then you can trade them for $1,500 worth of travel, as long as you book your flights or rooms through Chase.
The card has a $450 annual fee, but it gives back $300 of it each year once you purchase at least that amount in travel. It also gives out a generous amount of points three per dollar spent on travel and dining. Plus, you can swap points for miles on many airlines if you want to take your chances with seat availability in those reward schemes. Other perks include access to some airport lounges and a rebate for fees you pay for TSA PreCheck, the expedited security screening, or Global Entry, which speeds international returns.
In cardland, any offer this lucrative tends not to last. This week, Chase said it would cut the 100,000-point bonus in half for anyone who applied online after Jan. 12 or in a branch (which isnt possible for people in parts of the country where there are no Chase branches ) after March 12. To be safe, the company suggests applying online by Jan. 11, before it flips the switch the next day.
Why the change of heart on a product Chase introduced last summer? The company always said the bonus was an introductory offer, and the banks generosity led to a $200 million to $300 million hit to its earnings . So the window on a good thing is partly closing.
So should you take advantage of it while you can? My wife and I both have done it and are glad we did. It has required some mental energy to channel the right amount of spending away from our current card and track the new bills so we dont end up paying late. But there is nothing that focuses the mind quite like feeling that you are beating the system.
This feeling of superiority may be delusional, given the amount of research that suggests that we pay more when we put things on plastic than when we pay with cash. But I consider myself above average in this regard, as we all probably do.
Another big question: Does it make sense to stick with the Chase card, or ditch it after the bonuses clear? One useful exercise is to run your spending patterns (which your card companys website ought to be able to divide into categories like dining, travel and groceries) through creditcardtuneup.com to compare the results with those of a number of leading rewards cards.
Its a great tool, but the sites operator has its own opinions about how much a Chase point is worth versus the Starwood points that I collect on my primary American Express card . Your mileage may vary if you, say, swap Chase or Starwood points for frequent-flier miles and then redeem them for $10,000 first-class plane tickets to a faraway country. Think about your goals for the next couple of years and evaluate accordingly.
In our household, we are reserving judgment. That is (in part) because Starwood is in the middle of being acquired

by Marriott, which faces the challenging task of combining two loyalty programs without driving away big- spending frequent travelers. Sometime in the next year or so, we will find out what it is going to do.
Standard disclaimers apply here, as always. Dont carry a balance, since interest charges will generally eat up the value of the rewards and then some. Also, applying for too many cards in a short time could hurt your credit score a bit.
IS THE MADNESS CATCHING? Gordon Smith , the chief executive of consumer and community banking at Chase, spent more than 25 years working at American Express , and it was plainly obvious that the bank was aiming Sapphire Reserve squarely at the Amex Platinum card. Indeed, less than two months after the Chase card appeared in August, Amex issued a news release announcing new benefits for Platinum card holders.
Here is what it didnt do, though: offer a 100,000-point bribe to every new customer who wanted one of its cards. Its standard online offer is currently 40,000 of its own proprietary points , which are 10,000 fewer than what Chases new, lower bonus will be. (Yes, its hard to compare the value of different reward currencies, but these two arent that far apart, and many consumers never make the distinction and assume they are the same anyhow.)
Some American Express customers have been luckier, though. Card industry bloggers report that the company has sometimes made targeted bonus offers of 100,000 or even 150,000 points.
Leah Gerstner, an American Express spokeswoman, noted that the company had been in the premium card market for more than three decades, implying that it knew a thing or two about appropriate competitive responses to the latest shiny thing.
Whats worked for us is a mix of targeted sign-up bonuses combined with a range of premium benefits and services, Ms. Gerstner said. She added that the company had issued record levels of new cards while delivering sustainable economics to the company.
In their report in November, the Bernstein Research analysts dangled the tantalizing possibility that American Express might begin some kind of price war, throwing its own sky-high bonuses and privileges at customers.
Now that Chase has lowered its sign-up bonus, however, Kevin J. St. Pierre, a Bernstein managing director, thinks the chances of that are low.
They have inertia on their side, with a long-tenured customer base that is generally satisfied with their product and very satisfied with the service, he said. So how much do they need to tweak to defend that?
PITY NOT THE POOR BANKERS Shareholders (and consumers who are determined to be the least profitable customers of thriving, generous banks) probably shouldnt panic about the ramifications of the banks largess at this point.
Chase would not comment about the performance of Sapphire Reserve, owing to the requirement to stay silent before its coming earnings announcement. Still, it almost certainly modeled the possibility that some people would spend their 100,000-point bonus and then stop using the card. The cards long-term profitability will depend largely on what percentage of cardholders carry a balance and how much and for how long.
Mr. St. Pierre said he didnt lose much sleep over a single, too-generous card offering from a bank of this size.

They are so large that they can afford to experiment, he said. A few hundred million in any quarter is a cost of doing business, and theyll use it, learn from it and improve the product from their perspective and move on.
Citis own plastic pushers have already done a bit of this. Its competing Prestige card reduced some perks several months back, though it kept a fourth-night-free hotel benefit. Our strategic focus is delivering products and experiences that create long, lasting relationships, said Chris Fred, head of proprietary products for Citis cards unit. Bonus chasers and short-term card churners, it seems, are not particularly welcome.
Still, the banks face an existential crisis of sorts . A generation of young adults grew up on debit cards, and banks are going to have to do something to get the millions of them who dont need to carry a balance to switch to credit anyway. There arent a lot of great ways to do it other than throwing ever-larger bonuses and perks at them.
The rest of us can keep an eye on the bonus offers via blogs like The Points Guy and View From the Wing or on forums like FlyerTalk and Reddits card-churning pages . Then when the going gets as good as its gotten in recent months and we want to go on a free vacation we can sweep in and gleefully pick off the juiciest offers of all.

Soon, a majority of its business will be related to pets, thanks to a $7.7 billion acquisition announced Monday.
Mars agreed to buy VCA, a company that owns about 800 animal hospitals, a lab business and dog day care franchises that operate under the name Camp Bow Wow. VCA will be part of Mars Petcare but will operate as a distinct and separate business unit, the companies said in a statement on Monday.
Poul Weihrauch, the president of Mars Petcare, said in an interview that Mars love story with pets goes back to 1935. That year, Forrest Mars Sr. bought Chappell Brothers, giving the candy company access to Chappie brand canned dog food.
Today, Mars has 39 brands in its Petcare portfolio, its second largest division. With this deal, Petcare will become its largest business, as VCA adds about $2 billion in revenue. Together, Petcare, chocolate and Wrigley contribute 90 percent of company sales.
The impetus for the acquisition goes back years. Mars, based in McLean, Va., uses VCAs lab services in its veterinary businesses. Talks about a deal began when Mars approached VCA in November. VCA, based in Los Angeles, had been an independent company for more than 30 years, and Bob Antin, the chief executive, said it was not looking to sell.
But Mr. Antin said the prospect of joining Mars, and no longer being a public company, was intriguing.
Merging with Mars, which is privately held, rids VCA of the challenges of being a public company, including the difficulty of justifying large investment in research and development, said Mr. Antin, 66, in an interview. He said he would remain chief executive of the unit after the acquisition closes.
Well be able to leverage off their technology, and the amazing part about it is their company is focused on whats best for veterinarians, Mr. Antin said.
Mars agreed to acquire VCA for $93 a share in cash, 31 percent higher than where the shares closed on Friday. VCA traded at a high, up 28 percent to $90.60 a share, after news of the acquisition. Including debt, the deal is valued at $9.1 billion.
Mars has committed financing from JPMorgan Chase for the transaction, which has been approved by both boards but still needs approval from VCA shareholders and regulators. The companies said they expected the transaction to close in the third quarter of this year.
Mr. Antin and Mr. Weihrauch, 48, have more in common than the combination of their businesses. They each have labradors and three children.

The choice of Mr. Clayton signals that the focus of the S.E.C. may shift to the capital markets to ease fund-raising efforts by companies. This reflects part of a larger agenda for Mr. Trump to lighten the regulatory burden on the financial sector, something that Congress has pushed in the past few years by loosening the restrictions on crowdfunding and other ways companies can acquire capital. Mr. Clayton is expected to support rolling back the Dodd-Frank Act, the source of many of the rules restricting bank operations that have generated significant opposition from Wall Street.
Mr. Clayton is much more of an unknown quantity regarding securities enforcement because he has not had any significant involvement in that area. Observers are left to hunt for indicators of his leanings if the Senate confirms his nomination.
One hint involves a 2011 report by a committee of the New York City Bar Association headed by Mr. Clayton that criticized how aggressively prosecutors and the S.E.C. have applied the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits bribery of foreign officials to obtain business. The report argued that broad application of the law hamstrings American companies in the global marketplace when other countries do not police their companies as closely. One of the conclusions was that the continued unilateral and zealous enforcement of the F.C.P.A. by the United States may not be the most effective means to combat corruption globally in fact, in some circumstances it may exacerbate the problem of overseas corruption.
The report was part of a concerted effort, led by the Chamber of Commerce, to cut back on the scope of the act so that businesses did not face potentially significant costs from dealings in countries in which corruption was endemic. The Chamber issued its own proposal, Restoring Balance, aimed at limiting how aggressively the law could be used to police overseas corruption.
That effort largely ended in December 2012 when The New York Times described widespread bribery by Walmart in Mexico. Instead of cutting back, the Justice Department and S.E.C. continue to pursue cases across a wide range of sectors, most recently one involving a $264 million settlement with JPMorgan Chase over its hiring of interns with family ties to leaders in the Chinese government. The Walmart investigation has gone on for nearly four years, costing the company hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees, and a potential settlement is likely to be put in front of Mr. Clayton in the coming months.
We should be careful about reading too much into the committee report as a complete reflection of Mr. Claytons views, even though he was the committees chairman at the time. Lawyers often keep their advocates hat in place when working on these projects. Deal lawyers dislike the uncertainty posed by the F.C.P.A. when a company with global operations is involved because of the potential that an instance of bribery could be uncovered that might derail the transaction.
Mr. Clayton is not the only critic of the foreign bribery law who later came to enforce it. The current head of the Fraud Section in the Justice Department, which handles foreign bribery cases, was the lead author of the Chamber of Commerce report seeking to restrict its scope, yet the government has continued to pursue such cases.
The S.E.C. has changed since 2009, when Mary L. Schapiro, who had a strong regulatory background, took over
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 52 of 2571

after disastrous revelations about the agencys failure to catch the Ponzi scheme operated by Bernard L. Madoff. Her successor in 2013, Mary Jo White, came into office promising an even more aggressive approach to enforcement, reflective of her background as the United States attorney in Manhattan, one of the premier offices pursuing financial crimes.
Mr. Clayton has a far different mandate, so a key indicator of his approach to enforcement will be the appointment of a new director of the enforcement division, which has primary responsibility for investigating violations and litigating civil charges.
Two of the last three enforcement directors were former federal prosecutors who cut their teeth under Ms. White. The S.E.C. has started to mimic the approach taken by the Justice Department by allowing deferred-prosecution agreements for cooperating companies and granting immunity to witnesses who can provide valuable information. Choosing someone with a background in criminal prosecution may signal that the aggressive approach to enforcement will continue.
The enforcement division also gained much greater freedom under Ms. Schapiro to operate without supervision in 2009, one of the responses to the scandal caused by Mr. Madoffs fraud. Instead of having to get the five S.E.C. commissioners to sign off on a formal investigation, which allows subpoenaing documents and witnesses, now the director has that authority, allowing quicker development of investigations. This was a significant change from how the agency operated under the chairmanship of Christopher Cox, who left office in 2009 at a time when the agency was being criticized for a lack of supervision of Wall Street in the lead-up to the financial crisis.
Mr. Clayton could reverse this by shifting the authority to approve investigations back to the full commission, which would have the effect of slowing them down and perhaps narrowing the scope of an inquiry. That would also allow the commissioners to focus enforcement efforts rather than let the S.E.C. staff set the agenda.
Another area to watch is whether Mr. Claytons views on the F.C.P.A. result in de-emphasizing investigations in this area. The enforcement division currently has a specialized unit for foreign bribery , but a new director may reorganize staff members to shift resources away from these cases. The flip side is that the Justice Department shares jurisdiction over the bribery law, so federal prosecutors would also have to scale back investigations to effect a real diminution of these cases.
Policing misconduct by corporations and Wall Street requires at least a verbal acknowledgment from Mr. Clayton that it remains a priority; it is something of a mom and apple pie issue whose virtues are usually unquestioned. And we should not expect him to make the mistake of an earlier chairman, who once said that the S.E.C. would be a kinder and gentler place for accountants, even though that remark was largely taken out of context.
We can expect to see fewer enforcement actions because Ms. Whites broken windows policy, through which she pursued a large number of small transgressions, is likely to be dropped. That alone would not indicate that Mr. Clayton is taking a softer approach in this area, but the key will be whether there is a continued commitment of resources to the enforcement division. The proof will come in how the S.E.C. pursues violations, especially if there is a corporate scandal that is decried in Twitter posts coming from the White House.
The fact that Mr. Clayton has worked closely with Wall Street does not necessarily mean financial firms have a protector in office, much as when Joseph P. Kennedy, the first chairman of the S.E.C., was accused of being the fox guarding the henhouse when President Franklin D. Roosevelt nominated him. Just as the revolving door results in many lawyers switching from regulator or prosecutor to defender of corporations, so too the door swings the

other way, so that a lawyer from private practice can adopt an aggressive approach in representing the interests of the new client that has significant law enforcement powers. As always, time will tell.

22-Feb-18,118.14,118.9,117.32,118.77,16511229,chase,"Volkswagen is on the verge of pleading guilty to criminal charges and paying $4.3 billion in fines, in a deal that would resolve a federal criminal investigation into its cheating on vehicle emissions tests, the automaker said on Tuesday.
The expected guilty plea and the recent arrest of a Volkswagen executive on conspiracy charges buck a pattern of companies essentially paying their way out of criminal accusations. While companies often face large fines for wrongdoing, it is far less common for them to admit to breaking the law.
As a result of the deal, Volkswagen could be required to cooperate with investigations into individual company employees, accelerating the pace of those cases.
A guilty plea would also be likely to weaken the companys ability to defend itself against investigations by state attorneys general, and against lawsuits brought by shareholders who accuse Volkswagen of waiting too long to disclose the financial risk of its emissions cheating.
According to two people briefed on the settlement, Volkswagen is expected to plead guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to violate the Clean Air Act , customs violations, and obstruction of justice. The people could not talk publicly about the deal because it was not yet final. Many of the 600,000 cars in the United States equipped with the emissions-cheating software were imported from Germany or Mexico.
The $4.3 billion in fines covers criminal and civil aspects of the governments case, including environmental and customs-related penalties. The fines would bring the total cost of the scandal to Volkswagen in the United States to $20 billion, including settlements of civil suits by car owners, certainly one of the most costly corporate scandals in history.
The details of the deal, which requires the approval of the companys management and supervisory boards, were provided by Volkswagen in a financial disclosure on Tuesday. Volkswagen said in the disclosure that money it had set aside for scandal-related costs would be insufficient to cover the latest agreement. A vote on the matter could come on Wednesday.
The Justice Department declined to comment.

Regulators in the United States began investigating Volkswagen in early 2014 after a study by West Virginia University showed that its diesel cars polluted far more on the road than during official emissions tests.
Company executives knew that the cars were programmed to recognize when they were being tested and to deliver exemplary pollution readings, according to investigators. Rather than admit wrongdoing, Volkswagen representatives provided false and misleading information for more than a year to the California Air Resources Board and the Environmental Protection Agency.
A manager accused of playing a central role in that cover-up was arrested on Saturday. Oliver Schmidt , 48, Volkswagens former top emissions compliance manager in the United States, was taken into custody at Miami International Airport as he was about to board a flight to Germany.
The case against Mr. Schmidt, who is charged with defrauding the government and violating the Clean Air Act, would probably not be affected by a settlement between the company and federal authorities. James Liang, a former Volkswagen engineer who worked for the automaker in California, pleaded guilty in September to charges that included conspiracy to defraud the federal government and violating environmental regulations.
German prosecutors are conducting their own investigation which would not be affected by the settlement with the United States.
Volkswagen said that the settlement would include a statement of facts that are the basis for the fines, but provided no details about what it might say. The statement could provoke further consequences if Volkswagen admits that top managers knew of the fraud sooner than they have acknowledged, or if any current top managers had knowledge of the cover-up.
The fallout from the scandal has already reached the top of the company, with Martin Winterkorn resigning as chief executive in September . German prosecutors are now investigating whether Mr. Winterkorn and another executive, Hans Dieter Po?tsch, violated securities laws.
Shareholder lawsuits in the United States and Europe say that top managers knew of the cheating months if not years before the E.P.A. issued a news release about the illegal software in September 2015. The company violated its duty to inform shareholders of the risk, the suits say.
Should Volkswagen finalize the agreement, it would be one of a number of companies to reach settlements with federal investigators in a recent flurry of activity before President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office. In December, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $7.2 billion related to its marketing of toxic securities tied to the United States housing market.
In Volkswagens case, the settlement may reflect eagerness on the part of Obama administration officials to strike a deal while they are still in office, and the companys reluctance to gamble on the new leadership.
Volkswagen faces separate criminal investigations by the attorneys general in 42 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for New York State Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said, Volkswagen demonstrated a total disregard for the law and for the protection of public health and the environment. Mr. Schneidermans office has taken a lead in the cases brought by the states. She declined to comment further on the

investigations.
The criminal case against Volkswagen, and the expected guilty plea, have set it apart from other recent auto industry inquiries. In settlements with General Motors and Toyota over their handling of safety defects, the companies agreed to pay large fines , but did not plead guilty.
In the financial sector, JPMorgan Chase negotiated a similar deal over accusations that it had turned a blind eye to the Ponzi scheme run by Bernard L. Madoff .
Prosecutors are also mulling criminal charges against Takata, the Japanese manufacturer under criminal investigation for its defective airbags .
The idea is that it isnt acceptable to let companies pay billions of dollars to avoid criminal liability, said David M. Uhlmann, law professor at the University of Michigan and a former chief of the Environmental Crimes Section at the Justice Department. And Volkswagen made a bad situation worse when it lied for so many months about its emissions cheating.",0
15-Mar-18,115.5,116.425,114.76,114.98,17070356,chase,"JPMorgan Chase inappropriately retaliated against a former employee who raised questions about the banks sales tactics and investment products, the Labor Department found.
The bank was ordered to pay back wages and damages to Johnny Burris, a former broker at one of its Arizona branches. A letter released on Tuesday by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration , a division of the department, said that JPMorgan had violated provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley law designed to protect whistle- blowers.
A spokeswoman for JPMorgan, Patricia Wexler, said the bank planned to appeal the findings. Ms. Wexler noted that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the industrys self-funded regulator, had previously ruled against Mr. Burris when he told an arbitration panel that he was fired as retaliation.
Mr. Burris was fired in late 2012 after resisting managers who were pressuring him to sell JPMorgan investment products that were not suitable or were too risky for his mostly elderly clients.
The Labor Department investigator said that the offenses that JPMorgan cited for firing Mr. Burris were, in some cases, based on questionable evidence, and that they were not enough, in normal circumstances, to get an employee fired.
The investigator wrote that the bank did not follow its progressive disciplinary policy and went outside its normal disciplinary tract to terminate Mr. Burris, apparently because of his complaints about the banks sales tactics.
In separate proceedings, the bank agreed in 2015 to pay $307 million to settle accusations that it had improperly steered clients to the companys in-house investment funds, as Mr. Burris had argued. That settlement was with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission .
Mr. Burris complained about the sales tactics and his treatment by the bank in a 2013 story in The New York Times , and his problems continued after that.
Soon after the article appeared in the Times, Mr. Burriss manager added several customer complaints to Mr. Burriss regulatory record, despite the fact that he had left the bank many months earlier.
Some of these customers later told the Times that they had not had any concerns about Mr. Burris and that the complaints had been written by Mr. Burriss manager.
Mr. Burris has said that because of the marks that his manager put on his records, he was unable to get hired by other firms.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration inquiry found that Mr. Burriss manager did indeed appear to act inappropriately in filing the complaints.
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said in a filing last fall that it was likely to bring disciplinary action against Mr. Burriss manager for creating misleading documents and making misleading statements.
The letter this week ordered JPMorgan to pay Mr. Burris $64,462.03 in back wages and $100,000 in damages, along with his legal fees.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 87 of 2571
Mr. Burris said that he was happy his record would be cleared, as the investigator ordered, but that he did not think the finding went far enough in punishing JPMorgan.
I am reviewing all options, including filing my case before the U.S. District Court to receive a trial by my peers, he said.

15-Mar-18,115,117.45,114.67,115.19,14212461,chase,"After eight years in the political wilderness, its name synonymous with the supposedly undue and self-serving influence in Washington that brought us the financial crisis and the Wall Street bailout, Goldman Sachs is again making its presence felt. In the Trump administration, to an unprecedented degree, economic policy making is largely being handed over to people with Goldman ties.
The Goldman alumni include Steven T. Mnuchin, the nominee for Treasury s ecretary ; Gary D. Cohn, tapped as director of the National Economic C ouncil and White House adviser on economic policy; and Stephen K. Bannon, who was named chief White House strategist . Jay Clayton, named to head the Securities and Exchange Commission , is a Wall Street lawyer who has represented Goldman.
This week President-elect Donald J. Trump hired Dina H. Powell , a Goldman partner who heads impact investing, as a White House adviser. Anthony Scaramucci, a Goldman alumnus (whom I spotlighted last week ), is on the Trump transition committee and is expected to be named to a White House position as well.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 89 of 2571
And this after Mr. Trump campaigned against Wall Street, excoriated Senator Ted Cruz for his ties to Goldman, and castigated Hillary Clinton for giving paid speeches to big banks, Goldman among them.
The Goldman influx has so far drawn little criticism, perhaps because worries about what once would have been deemed undue influence now mix with relief that there is some adult supervision in the executive branch.
On balance, its a plus, Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who built his fortune on Wall Street, told me this week. Whatever you may think of them individually, you cant get to be a Goldman partner and survive if youre stupid, lazy or unprofessional. (Mr. Bloomberg is co-chairman of Goldmans 10,000 Small Businesses initiative, which provides support to fledgling entrepreneurs.)
Whatever bricks Mr. Trump threw at Wall Street during the campaign, investors have cheered his victory, driving the stock market to new highs. And Goldman has been a particular beneficiary, with its shares gaining 35 percent since Election Day the top-performing stock in the Dow Jones industrial average in that time.
Mr. Trump, a spokeswoman of his told me, sees no contradiction here. Theres a difference between individuals who happen to have worked at Goldman Sachs, at some point in their careers, and Goldman Sachs itself. Hes said from the beginning that hell hire the very best people for the job regardless of where they worked before, which is what hes done throughout his career, said the spokeswoman, Hope Hicks.
While the firms influence in a Trump administration may reach a new apex, Goldman alumni have long been fixtures in both Republican and Democratic administrations. The Goldman legend Sidney J. Weinberg headed Franklin D. Roosevelts influential Business Advisory and Planning Council.
Recent Treasury secretaries with Goldman roots include Robert E. Rubin, a former co-chairman, under Bill Clinton; and Henry M. Paulson Jr., a former chairman and chief executive, under George W. Bush.
Even in the Obama administration, where a Goldman pedigree was something akin to a scarlet letter, Gary Gensler was credited with reviving a moribund Commodity Futures Trading Commission and might have been Treasury secretary had Mrs. Clinton won in November.
Which raises the question: Why would such a disproportionate number of the best people, in Mr. Trumps view, come from just one bank? After all, Goldman is hardly the only large bank, and it is also far from the biggest. It employs roughly 33,000 people; JPMorgan Chases work force is many times as large.
Many point to a unique Goldman culture that has long encouraged public service and philanthropy as integral to its business model.
Goldman does seem to produce people who are very smart and have valuable experience, Mr. Bloomberg said. And they have a culture and a long tradition of leaving the firm for public service. The firm pushes them to do that.
Mr. Cohn would seem to be a good example. After 26 years at the firm, most recently as president and chief operating officer, he sought out Mr. Trump once it became clear that Goldmans chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, had no immediate plans to step down.
Mr. Cohn would hardly seem an obvious choice for the Trump administration he is a registered Democrat and
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 90 of 2571

had no past relationship with Mr. Trump. But he knew Jared Kushner, Mr. Trumps son-in-law, and after several face-to-face meetings, Mr. Trump was won over by Mr. Cohns innovative ideas for financing infrastructure projects and his up-by-the-bootstraps biography: Mr. Cohn, the son of an Ohio electrician, overcame dyslexia and taught himself options trading before talking his way into a position at the New York Mercantile Exchange. (Mr. Cohn declined to comment.)
Mr. Blankfein told me this week that public service is deeply embedded in Goldmans culture. When I became a partner in 1988, you were expected to manage your career so that when they wrote your obituary, no more than three paragraphs would be about Goldman Sachs, he said. Most people leave by age 48 or 50. By then youve made enough money. The expectation was youd turn to philanthropy or government service.
He said the acculturation process begins in recruiting. We tend to recruit people who are very public service- minded, he said. We want people who are interesting and have diverse interests, people youd want to engage with. Ive always been a proponent of a liberal arts education for undergraduates. To develop breadth, to be interesting to yourself and other people, take a lab course or read Shakespeare. Dont become a human calculator.
While Goldman partners take pride in the good works of their colleagues and employees and were badly stung by the questioning of their motives after the financial crisis the emphasis on public service isnt driven entirely by altruism. Goldmans business model has traditionally stressed long-term relationships in both the private and public sectors.
High-profile government service by its alumni has largely burnished the firms reputation within the business community and, accurately or not, enhanced the perception that Goldman partners are just a phone call away from the executive branch. Already, chief executives have been calling Goldman partners seeking access to Mr. Cohn and Mr. Mnuchin.
Mr. Blankfein dismisses the notion that the firm has any undue influence in Washington. Its an imprimatur on our firm that we have such good people that the administration wants to hire them, he said. It pains me to lose some of them. But the perception that theyll go to Washington and then favor us is false. The reverse is true. Theyll bend over backwards to avoid that. Theyre not going to serve the interests of Goldman Sachs. They have their own careers and reputations to worry about.
Exhibit A in that regard may be Mr. Gensler, at the time the youngest person to be made partner at Goldman (when he was 30). Two liberal senators tried to block his nomination to head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on the grounds that he was too close to Wall Street. But by the time he left the agency, it had filed a record number of cases against major Wall Street banks.

The deal, which substantially reduces the country's need to sell bonds this year, comes just before Mr. Caputo and other officials will travel abroad to promote the issuance of up $7 billion next Thursday.
Under the deal, Argentina will borrow $1 billion each from Santander, BBVA Frances, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and J.P. Morgan, paying an interest rate of Libor plus 290 basis points.
The deal helps assure the government can cover most of this year's financing needs in the first month of 2017. It also takes pressure off officials to issue more debt next week at higher rates than they might otherwise prefer.
""This is very, very positive news for us,"" Mr. Caputo told a news conference. ""This lowers our need to tap the market by $6 billion.""
Mr. Caputo said his team has been working to guarantee this year's financing needs--about $20 billion in new debt- -while reducing exposure to potentially higher interest rates that some economists say could result from the election of Donald Trump in the U.S.
""Nobody knows what's going to happen,"" Mr. Caputo said. ""But our job is to minimize risk. This clears a potential cloud and helps reduce uncertainty so people can say that this year won't be tough.""
Argentina plans to sell up to $5 billion in dollar-denominated bonds and up to $2 billion in peso-denominated debt, Mr. Caputo said. He added that the government plans to keep investors hungry for additional debt and won't likely issue as many bonds as possible next week.
Mr. Caputo said Argentina's debt to GDP ratio is among the lowest in Latin America and easily sustainable compared with other countries that have issued debt at lower rates than Argentina.
""Most of the time we're not issuing debt to pay for spending but to replace maturing bonds,"" Mr. Caputo said. ""Expectations are that demand will be very good.""",1

 Takata is expected to plead guilty over deadly airbags.
But will this remain the case, given the officials announcing the white-collar cases will soon be leaving? It falls in the hands of Senator Jeff Sessions, President-elect Donald J. Trumps pick for attorney general.

Two liberal senators even tried to block his nomination. But by the time he left the agency, it had filed a record number of cases against major Wall Street banks.
Chief executives have nevertheless already been calling Goldman partners seeking access to the incoming administration.
Others have been going to the president-elect himself. Mr. Trump was paid a visit by Randall Stephenson, AT&Ts chief executive, on Thursday  a tricky meeting since AT&T is pursuing a deal for Time Warner that is set to be reviewed by regulators appointed by Mr. Trump.
President Obamas farewell address on Tuesday night was not all nostalgia and hope. The darker theme? People losing out to technological change .
Economists agree that automation has played a greater role in job loss than globalization, but few people want to stop technological progress.
That change could soon be a bigger problem, with 51 percent of all the activities Americans do at work involving predictable physical work, data collection and data processing (but not as quickly as some fear, according to a McKinsey report ).
Mr. Obama suggested that stronger unions, a tax overhaul and an updated safety net could help deal with the problem. But the Trump administration may not be on board with that.
Mr. Trump himself has focused more on trade, offshoring and immigration.
Robert J. Shiller, an economics professor at Yale, argues that protectionist policies and penalties for exporters will still not create sustainable jobs for Americans left behind .
But Mr. Trumps ideas might be bolstered by Amazons move to hire 100,000 more people over the next 18 months. Indeed, Jeff Bezos, Amazons founder, met with Mr. Trump last month. The president-elects press secretary said that Mr. Trump was pleased to have played a role in the decision regarding hiring.

The case stalled until February 2016, when the bank returned to court and demanded that it be allowed to foreclose and sell the 4,119-square-foot property.
On Dec. 1, the judge approved the bank's motion for summary judgement, meaning it can begin the process of foreclosing on the home.
Dina has yet to take action against the judgement. In 2012, Lindsay Lohan gave her mom a $40,000 loan to keep her from being evicted.
Dina Lohan did not respond to requests for comment.

    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 104 of 2571
Her group, SOIL, provides toilets to poor households. Each week it sent representatives to empty the five-gallon buckets, bring the waste to the dump and turn it into compost, which was sold to farmers as fertilizer.
Nearly nine years into the work, though, the local dump fell into chaos when the private company managing it lost its contract. The government ceased to keep access roads clear and began burning trash to clear it.
We managed to keep the compost site open, but we could only get in there once every two weeks, Dr. Kramer said. There was so much smoke out there that it was becoming a health risk.
Worse, she said she didnt know where to turn to get money for another site.
Crises like these, which keep nonprofits from doing the work donors support, are not uncommon. About one in five projects run into problems that slow or derail goals, according to the Clinton Global Initiative, which released a report in June on its commitments over 10 years, and a separate one by Open Road Alliance, a nonprofit that aids projects that have hit snags.
Despite the likelihood of problems, leaders of nonprofit organizations rarely lay out the risks of their projects, lest any hint of failure scare away funders. On the flip side, donors often fail to dig deeply enough to discuss the obstacles a project may encounter. Among donors, 76 percent dont ask recipients about the risks they face, while 87 percent of nonprofit leaders said grant applications had no questions about risks, according to Open Road Alliance.
This isnt anecdotal evidence, said Laurie Michaels, Open Roads founder. This is donors and funders reporting that 20 percent of the projects need more money. Yet no one ever asks about this.
Spurred by this research, and by its experience with shoring up projects in crisis, Open Road Alliance partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation and Arabella Advisors, a nonprofit consultancy, in convening a group of nonprofit executives to think through risk assessment.
The group, which consisted of representatives from two dozen organizations, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Goldman Sachs and the law firm Patterson Belknap Webb &Tyler, agreed on 10 areas where donors needed to assess risk more rigorously. The tool kit, as the group calls it, will be released next week for anyone to use.
We designed the tool kit very deliberately, so a foundation could take it in total or pick and choose tools a?la carte, said Maya Winkelstein, who served as chairwoman of the group, called the Commons. Our hope is people will print off the tool kit and bring it to their staff meetings or their board meetings or to their C.F.O. of programming.
Given the spike in philanthropic giving, the time is ripe to discuss the downsides of giving money away. A study released this week by the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy predicted that charitable giving would rise 3.6 percent this year and 3.8 percent next year, based on a strong economy.
The biggest increase will come from foundations, which are often financed by wealthy individuals. Foundations will increase their giving by 5.9 percent and 6 percent in the next two years, the report predicted.
But with that increase will come the need to apply business fundamentals to grant making and to look at all the potential downsides of a project.

FOR the past five years, the Rockefeller Foundation has set aside contingency funding for individual initiatives and broader programs, said Judith Rodin, its president. Her foundation also assesses its grants by low, medium and high risk.
Our tax-advantaged dollars create opportunities for us to take risk, but the evidence shows there isnt that much risk-taking in our sector, Dr. Rodin said. Taking smart risk is essential.
The risk management tool kit produced by the Commons covers broader areas like helping donors understand their own risk appetite with their grants, and putting together a risk policy statement similar to ones done for a portfolio of investments.
But the kit also has seven items dealing with specific conversations donors ought to have with groups they are supporting. These include talking about contingency funding and planning, putting in place their own risk management strategies and monitoring the progress of the project in order to pre-empt problems.
Part of the reason we focused on donors is they have the money, said Dr. Michaels, a clinical psychologist who is married to David Bonderman, a founder of the private equity firm TPG.
Theres a power differential, she added. Its hard for a nonprofit to come to a funder and say, How are you going to insure us if something gets screwed up?
Less than a year ago, Reclaim Detroit, which trains workers to salvage wood from homes slated for demolition and repurpose it, lost its warehouse to a blaze. With no wood, no equipment and no work space, it had also no plan for dealing with such a total loss and was in danger of folding.
Reclaim Detroit partly supports itself through the sale of objects it makes from the reclaimed wood something it could not do after the fire. But it also receives grants from companies like the JPMorgan Chase Foundation, the PNC Bank Foundation and others that are directed at its job training program and operational expenses.
What it didnt have, though, was money to rebuild after the fire.
Susan Dundon, business innovation director at EcoWorks, the nonprofit parent of Reclaim Detroit, said the group tried to raise money from the community, but then one of its program funders, REDF, directed it to Open Road Alliance, which gave $100,000 as bridge funding so the nonprofit could get running again.
Some of it went for operating funds to continue to pay our crew, who was paid out of our earned revenues, Ms. Dundon said. The main part was to rebuild our mill shop and to buy new equipment.
Not everyone in the philanthropic community thinks such contingency funding is a good idea. Amir Pasic, dean of the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, said nonprofits having to ask funders for money after a crisis can create an additional level of bureaucracy when funds are really needed.
Its getting us to continue to think about projects rather than organizations or causes, Dr. Pasic said. Its allowing us to forget the fact that if you have a really good relationship with your funder and they know whats going on, it doesnt have to be a formal contingency plan.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 106 of 2571

Dr. Pasic, who was not involved with the Commons, said he saw a place for such backstop funding with smaller organizations. But in general, he said, he supported the groups conclusion that larger nonprofits and funders should plan for problems.
You need a joint conversation upfront, he said. We need to create an honest conversation between both sides so we can be productive.
Shelley Whelpton, managing director of Arabella Advisors, said that while the tool kit will start those conversations, it will take time to get donors to think differently. There is culture change that needs to take place first, she said. The kit, she added, is a way to start a conversation.
IN the case of SOIL, which has an annual budget of $1.3 million, Dr. Kramer said she went back to one of its longest-standing funders, the 11th Hour Project, which is backed by Wendy Schmidt, whose wealth comes from Google. Dr. Kramer said she was told the foundation had already made its grants for the year, and she was pointed toward Open Road Alliance, which issued a $100,000 grant for a new composting site.
With our other donors, I have much more of a traditional grantee relationship, where I wouldnt go back and say, I need more money for the same project, she said. It just wasnt something I had considered before.
Despite losing its dump, SOIL was lucky. Open Road Alliance gave $3 million last year, mostly in the form of small grants. But it operates by word of mouth and referral; it hopes that with the tool kit, more nonprofits will be able to talk to their donors about crises.
Its one thing to get people on board saying, Youre right, we could be backing up our grantees in a more comprehensive way, but where do we start? Dr. Michaels said. One way to start is to lay out the path and say, These steps are not so difficult. Its an attempt to make it easier for people.",1
5-Mar-18,111.32,113.05,110.8,112.43,16358181,chase,"When securities laws are broken and investors get hurt, the Securities and Exchange Commission often rides to the rescue, using its regulatory muscle to extract penalties that can be returned to victims.
But as a cadre of harmed Citigroup investors is learning, it is one thing to persuade a wrongdoer to pay reparations and quite another to disburse the money.
This particular matter dates to August 2015, when the S.E.C. struck a settlement with Citigroup over an exotic investment strategy involving municipal bonds that the bank sold to clients from 2002 to 2008.
Contending that Citigroup had misrepresented the investments risks, the S.E.C. ordered the creation of a so-called fair fund to be distributed to investors. Citigroup neither admitted nor denied the allegations but agreed to pay $180 million into the fund.
That was over 16 months ago. Today, the wronged investors are not only still awaiting their money, but they have yet to see any plan outlining how the $180 million will be distributed, the S.E.C.s website shows .
Receiving reparations in cases like these is a multistep process that the S.E.C. details on the site. Typically, restitution funds sit in an account at the United States Treasury . Disbursement is generally overseen by outside entities appointed by the S.E.C.; their fees are paid by the institution providing the funds.
Fair funds were established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; they allow the S.E.C. to exact civil penalties in addition to recovering ill-gotten gains, a process known as disgorgement.
The S.E.C. website shows that the Citigroup case is one of roughly 80 fair fund and disgorgement plans currently operating. Another 60 or so plans have been terminated; this means they have finished distributing the money to investors. Any amounts left over go to the Treasury or an S.E.C. investor protection fund.
Patience is required of those going through the process, the S.E.C. warns. The process for distributing the money to harmed investors may take a long time, it noted on its site.
But the pace of the Citigroup restitution plan seems especially glacial. And it raises questions about how these plans are administered and whether those overseeing them are rewarded for slowing down the process.
At the time of the settlement, the S.E.C. said a plan of distribution to harmed investors would be submitted within 120 days of payment in full by Citigroup. That payment was made in August 2015, a bank spokeswoman said.
And yet, 500 days later, theres still no plan of distribution.
I asked the S.E.C. what was causing the holdup. Judith Burns, a spokeswoman, declined to comment.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 111 of 2571
Keep in mind: It has been almost nine years since the Citigroup investors incurred their losses when the municipal bond strategy collapsed in 2008. Advertised as a safe-money bet to some 4,000 clients who invested $3 billion, the strategy wound up losing between one-half and three-quarters of some customers account values. Seven years later came the settlement and the S.E.C. order to create the $180 million fund.
Lawyers for the aggrieved investors say they are losing patience. To me, it comes down to a bureaucratic quagmire of indifference and concealment, said Steven B. Caruso, a lawyer at Maddox Hargett &Caruso in New York City. There is simply no transparency in this process, and no effort being made by the S.E.C. to recognize that these are funds that belong to other people.
Because many of the investors are subject to confidentiality agreements, they were wary about discussing their concerns.
A bit of activity occurred in the case last April, when the S.E.C. said it had appointed a plan administrator for the fund. It was Garden City Group , a provider of legal administrative services that is a unit of Atlanta-based Crawford &Company.
Then more silence.
Of course, it isnt simple returning money to wronged investors. Determining who deserves how much of a settlements proceeds, and locating those people, is complicated. Needless to say, recovering some losses, even if its pennies on the dollar and many years later, is better than never receiving a thing.
But the S.E.C. trumpets its role in getting money back to harmed investors. In its most recent annual report , for example, the agency said, Hundreds of billions of dollars were returned to harmed investors as a result of our aggressive enforcement program.
A review of the S.E.C. website shows that the timelines for these fund distributions can be long indeed. For example, in 2007, the S.E.C. settled an enforcement case with a mutual fund company and ordered the creation of a $40 million fund approved for distribution to wronged investors. That fund was approved in July 2015; the improprieties at the mutual fund company had occurred from September 2001 to October 2003, the S.E.C. said.
Even relatively simple cases seem to be a slog. Consider a municipal bond, pay-to-play case involving J.P. Morgan Securities and Jefferson County, Ala. In early November 2009, the bank settled with the S.E.C., without admitting or denying the allegations, and paid a $25 million penalty. A fair fund was set up to dispense the money to the county; the plan was approved in early October 2010 and disbursements went out in February 2011.
Even though the case involved just one recipient, it took 15 months from start to finish. I asked the S.E.C. how long each fair fund process takes, and got a partial answer.
In fiscal 2015, the most recent data available, the agency said 96 percent of fair funds and disgorgement plans had distributed 80 percent of their money within two years of a plans approval. That was a significant improvement over the previous year, when only 80 percent of funds had done so.
But these figures dont take into account the time between an S.E.C. settlement and a plans approval, which can be many years. In the $40 million mutual fund case dating to 2001, for example, it took eight years for the fund to
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 112 of 2571

be approved.
Mr. Caruso said he had tried repeatedly to get answers about what was happening with the fund. At first, the S.E.C. told him it was waiting to get the list of investors from Citigroup. Then, an agency official suggested he try Garden City Group, which he did.
Every time I would call, somebody else would call me back to say, We really dont have a timetable, and we dont have a lot of information, Mr. Caruso recalled.
I asked Stephen Cirami, chief operating officer of Garden City Group, about the status of the fund. He did not return my voice mail message or email.
I had hoped to learn how Garden City Group gets paid for its services. For example, is it incentivized to move quickly in distributing the funds, or is it paid more the longer the process takes?
It is Citigroup, not the investors, paying these costs. But an inefficient process means investors are hurt twice.
That $180 million should be back in peoples pockets, not sitting in some account somewhere, Mr. Caruso said. The bottom line is, theres no accountability.",1

12-Mar-18,109.1,111.05,106.2299,110.04,28188027,chase,"WASHINGTON  When Donald J. Trump strides onto the inaugural ballroom floor this week amid the sprawling celebration of his swearing-in, he will have corporate America and many of its titans to thank for the rapturous greeting.
Chevron, the oil giant, has given $500,000 for the dayslong festivities. Boeing, which has been a target of Mr. Trump , pledged $1 million . And Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, giants of the gambling industry, are said to have donated more than that by themselves.
They are far from alone.
All told, the group planning the inaugural festivities says it has raised more than $100 million, which would be nearly double the record for an inauguration, with much of it coming in six- and seven-figure checks from Americas corporate suites.
In exchange, Mr. Trumps most prolific donors will gain access to what amounts to a parallel inauguration week, carefully planned and largely out of public sight, during which they can mingle with members of the incoming administration over intimate meals and witness Mr. Trumps ascension from the front rows.
No matter which party controls the White House, corporations and wealthy individuals open their checkbooks every four years, and administrations reward their donors with private events and other incentives.
But ethics experts say Mr. Trumps donors are being given greater access and facing fewer limits on donations than those in other recent inaugurations, despite his vow to drain the swamp of special interests in Washington.
This is nothing short of selling access to the president, the vice president and the cabinet, said Craig Holman, a registered lobbyist for Public Citizen, a nonpartisan ethics group in Washington. This is very unfettered, brazen
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 123 of 2571
selling of access. It certainly runs counter to any presidential candidate who was talking about draining the swamp.
For those who have bankrolled the events, inauguration week will look quite a bit different from what it will to average Americans viewing it from home or the National Mall. The festivities will begin Tuesday evening with a black-tie Chairmans Global Dinner for Mr. Trumps cabinet picks, congressional leaders, foreign diplomats and a few top donors.
On Wednesday, events include a lunchtime reception hosted by Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff, and a dinner honoring Vice President-elect Mike Pence, according to a copy of the weeks schedule obtained by The New York Times.
Thursday will feature another leadership luncheon, a public concert at the Lincoln Memorial featuring artists like Toby Keith and 3 Doors Down, and a candlelight dinner with Mr. Trump and his family for about 1,500 in the great hall of Union Station.
Packages range from $25,000 to $1 million or more for both individuals and corporations, and as the figures rise, so do the number of invitations available and the level of proximity to the president-elect and his inner circle.
Throughout the week, private transportation will ferry donors between a handful of high-end hotels, where donors were given priority booking, and the events. During unscheduled time, donors will be able to take advantage of private tours of Smithsonian museums arranged for them by the inaugural committee.
Depending on the size of their gift, donors are also entitled to several V.I.P. tickets to an inaugural ball (there will be two, hosted on two floors of the convention center here), the inaugural parade and the swearing-in.
For the most important guests, including many of Mr. Trumps cabinet picks, his new hotel blocks from the White House will serve as a de facto home base and after-hours social venue, according to a member of the committee.
Unlike campaigns, inaugural committees face few regulations limiting what they can raise and how they can do it. That has traditionally left it up to each administration to set its own restrictions.
George W. Bush did not place restrictions on who could donate, but he did cap gifts at $100,000 in 2001 and at $250,000 in 2005.
Barack Obama went further in 2009, banning all gifts from lobbyists and corporations, and capping individual gifts at $50,000, even as his fund-raising team amassed $53 million, then a record. He relaxed those restrictions in 2013, generally accepting corporate gifts up to $1 million and individual gifts up to $250,000.
Mr. Trumps team said it would not accept gifts from registered federal lobbyists or solicit corporate donations over $1 million. The committee did not cap contributions from individuals.
While Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush also offered tiered incentive packages , Mr. Holman, of Public Citizen, said that the packages offered by Mr. Trumps team appeared to promise greater access than those of the recent past.
The inaugural committee will not be required to disclose its donors until late April, 90 days after the inauguration.

The funds will cover all nonofficial inaugural programming, though the committee has not detailed exactly how much it plans to spend. A spokesman, Boris Epshteyn, has said any leftover money will be donated to charity.
Thomas Barrack Jr., the private equity investor leading the committee, said his groups work was made considerably easier by a large untapped pool of donors who for one reason or another did not support Mr. Trumps campaign.
The fund-raising haul also shows that corporate America is coming around to the reality that it will have to do business with Mr. Trump, who has shown himself more than willing to single out individual companies for criticism. His inauguration offers them a first chance to show their support.
A lot of the people who were not on board early on are now getting on, said Mel Sembler, a longtime Republican fund-raiser who has helped solicit donations.
Among the donors will be UPS and JPMorgan Chase, which declined to directly sponsor the Republican National Convention last summer, despite past support. (The bank donated instead to summer youth employment programs in the host cities for both conventions.) Bank of America and Deloitte, donors to Mr. Obamas 2013 inauguration, will give again this year, too. And a spokesman for AT&T said the company had made both a monetary contribution and agreed to spend millions of dollars to bolster cellular service for the crowds.
Daniel I. Weiner, who studies campaign finance issues at the Brennan Center for Justice, said those gifts, while certainly not unusual, raised questions about Mr. Trumps campaign promises.
Virtually any industry of any significance in the United States has business with the government, and the chance to rub shoulders with the president and prominent officials is kind of priceless, he said.
In a statement issued to The Times on the committees fund-raising work, Mr. Epshteyn said the group was honored and humbled by the incredible outpouring of support and focused on organizing world-class events honoring the nations history.
Several members of the committee rejected the criticism of its fund-raising.
Look, a lot of people are just good American citizens, and they want to support the transfer of power, said Ray Washburne, a Dallas investor and a member of the committee. As far as buying influence, I dont know what kind of influence that can buy.
Mr. Sembler agreed, but said it was certainly good public relations for American companies to be backing the celebration.
Its important to have your name there if you are in that business, he said. Its like supporting your community.

12-Mar-18,113.11,113.11,107.84,107.88,27425837,chase,"This year, the rallying price of copper may get a further boost out of a crop of labor negotiations set to take place from Chile to Salt Lake City.
Analysts say wage negotiations at some of the world's biggest mines could disrupt production and push prices past $6,000 a ton, a level last seen in the summer of 2015.
On Monday in London, copper was trading 0.77% lower at $5,863 a ton.
That price is up by a quarter since October, boosted by expectations of stronger economic growth and anticipation of extra government infrastructure spending in the U.S. and China.
Now, industrial action could add further fuel to the gains. Labor contracts accounting for 13% of global copper production are due in 2017, compared to 9% of total supply last year, according to J.P. Morgan.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 131 of 2571
""If we have long-lasting strikes this year, this would be a significant driver for prices,"" said Caroline Bain, an economist at Capital Economics in London.
In Chile, labor unions have threatened a strike at the world's largest copper mine, while production at a Zambian mine has already been suspended earlier this month.
Coming later this year are wage negotiations at mines in the U.S. and Canada.
That could curb mining in a year when analysts are already expecting production growth to grind to a halt due to a lack of major new projects.
Even back in October, the International Copper Study Group, an organization of copper producing and consuming countries, forecast that world mine production would remain unchanged in 2017 after a 4% increase last year.
Copper mining is notoriously liable to disruptions, including through strikes and bad weather. Analysts and companies usually make a so-called ""disruption allowance"" of 5-7% in their forecasts for the amount of copper production expected to be lost to disruptions. Last year disruptions were unusually low, or less than 2%, Ms. Bain said.
That looks likely to change this year. Not only were wages set for renegotiations, but copper's rallying price has encouraged miners to ask for more.
""We expect wage negotiation could be quite tough in 2017,"" said Xao Fu, head of commodity markets strategy at BOCI Global Commodities.
In Chile, the world's biggest copper producer, labor negotiations are due at mines contributing around 14% of global mine production capability, said Paul Benjamin, research director at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
That includes the world's largest mine, BHP Billiton-majority-owned Escondida, where workers there have already threatened to strike over a pay dispute.
BHP declined to comment.
During a 25-day strike in 2006, production declined by more than a fifth over the year. Analysts at J.P. Morgan said that a prolonged strike at Escondida this year would be significant for the copper price, possibly boosting them above the key level of $6,000 a ton.
In the U.S., the contract for workers at Rio Tinto's Bingham Canyon mine near Salt Lake City, Utah is set to expire by the end of March 2017. The company declined to comment on the coming negotiations.
Rising prices themselves might not bode well for the negotiations, analysts say.
""The improving market price for copper may inspire workers to place greater demands on their employers, raising the risk of future disruptions,"" analysts at Barclays wrote in a report earlier this month.
After spending much of last year moving sideways, copper took off following the election of Donald Trump. That

That could add to healthy demand expected from China, the world's biggest consumer, and other importing nations as the global economy shows signs of improving.

12-Mar-18,111.55,114.45,111.146,112.87,21878324,chase,"JAKARTA, IndonesiaJ.P. Morgan Chase &Co. upgraded its assessment of Indonesian stocks Monday, after a downgrade two months ago led finance officials in the Southeast Asian nation to cut business ties with the U.S. bank .
* J.P. Morgan raised its asset allocation for Indonesian stocks one notch to neutral, saying bond-volatility risks had ""played out"" since Donald Trump's surprise win in the U.S. election and could subside further if Mr. Trump's incoming administration focuses more on trade than pro-growth policies.
In November, the largest U.S. bank by assets had downgraded its rating on Indonesian equities to underweight from overweight, citing the effects of increasing bond-market volatility following Mr. Trump's election victory. An underweight rating means the bank expects an investment to underperform others over the next six to 12 months.
Indonesia finance officials balked at the report, saying it wasn't credible and could destabilize the country's financial system. They removed J.P. Morgan from a list of about 20 financial institutions serving as primary dealers for the government's rupiah bonds and said the bank could no longer act as underwriter for the ministry's global offerings.
Indonesia also revised rules for primary dealers this month, saying banks have a duty to uphold Indonesia's interests. Many in the industry interpreted that as a veiled warning not to issue negative research reports. Indonesia has said it is open to negative assessments as long as they are substantiated.
In a report on Asia-Pacific equities on Monday, J.P. Morgan said that ""the rise in bond yields and large redemption in emerging-market funds we feared occurred"" but that its tactical concerns in Indonesia's downgrade ""had played out.""
The bank said it believes a period of high bond volatility has passed, and noted that outflow from Indonesian government bonds had ceased 15 days after Mr. Trump's win. In contrast, during the ""taper tantrum"" in 2013when global markets feared central banks were about to close the spigot of cheap post-financial-crisis cashIndonesian government-bond outflows persisted for 77 days.
In general, ""Asian equities proved resilient in the post-Trump bond volatility shock,"" the report said.
Schneider Siahaan, director of debt portfolio and strategy at Indonesia's Finance Ministry, said the bank's new assessment of the country's stocks wouldn't have any effect on Indonesia's decision to sever business ties, including for the bank's role as a primary dealer of government rupiah bonds.
""It's not going to make any difference, because they have to wait 12 months"" before reapplying to become a primary dealer, he said. Still, ""if they're cooperative in the future, it will be easier for the government to consider reappointing them.""
""It's good that they corrected it,"" said Darmin Nasution, coordinating minister for the economy. If analysts say that

""Trump becoming president will have a slight impact on [Indonesian] markets, it makes sense. But if you say the impact is high, that's too much.""
In its new report, J.P. Morgan suggested its November call had been the correct one, saying it was ""driven by the risk of Indonesia underperforming the Asia Pacific ex-Japan and emerging-market indices as investors de-risked"" and that Indonesia had subsequently underperformed a regional index.
Separately, J.P. Morgan said its research department ""publishes independent views and recommendations based on extensive and objective analysis. Our research views and recommendations on Indonesia are no different.""
The bank said in its report that a supporting factor in upgrading Indonesia included improving consumer data in Southeast Asia's largest economy and noted its decision last week to upgrade to overweight its rating on car maker Astra International, one of Indonesia's largest companies by market capitalization.
J.P. Morgan also said it is concerned about volatility from events in the first half of 2017 and that it managed the risk with the neutral call. It referred to a list of dozens of political, monetary and other events around the world, including Indonesian gubernatorial elections in February.
The bank also upgraded Australian equities to overweight from neutral. It downgraded Malaysian equities to neutral.

8-Mar-18,106.85,112.48,106.61,112.11,33114833,chase,"The S&P 500 hasn't experienced a one-day decline of 1% or more since Oct. 11, or 65 trading sessions. If the index avoids such a decline Tuesday, the current streak would equal the longest since the bull market began in March 2009. The postelection enthusiasm for U.S. stocks might be fading, but so far investors are reluctant to sell.
The S&P 500 inched 0.2% higher Friday. That marked the 65th consecutive trading day that the large-cap stock benchmark closed without a decline of more than 1%, just a day shy of tying the longest run of the nearly eight- year-old bull market, according to WSJ's Market Data Group. And should the U.S. stock market stave off a slide Tuesday, the 67 days in a row would be the longest streak since 2006.
Despite the dearth of downdrafts, the S&P 500 hasn't risen much recent weeks either. The S&P 500 rushed 6.2% higher in the four weeks after Election Day on expectations that tax cuts, infrastructure spending and a relaxed regulatory environment under a Trump administration would lift the economy. Yet since first crossing above 2270 on Dec. 13, the index has traded sideways, closing Friday at 2274.64.
In fact, the S&P 500 hasn't gained 1% or more since Dec. 7, or 25 trading sessions.
The lack of direction reflects growing concerns about high valuations and the uncertainty surrounding the odds that Congress will swiftly push through measures that will support the economy. The forward price/earnings ratio of the S&P 500 sits at 16.9, a hair below the bull-market high of 17.1, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Stretched valuations along with a thicket of earnings reports, including ones from and accompanying commentaries this week from the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Netflix Inc. and General Electric Co. could leave market susceptible to profit taking. Overall, companies in the S&P 500 are expected to report earnings grew by 3.2% in the fourth quarter, the best showing in two years.
""Investors are looking for companies to confirm the expected pick-up in growth during this earnings season,"" wrote Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at J.P. Morgan. ""If management's tone is more cautious than pro-growth, it could be a catalyst for profit taking.""
For Frank Cappelleri, a technical analyst at Instinet, a single 1% drop for the S&P 500 likely wouldn't doom the current rally so near all-time high. But he said that it might not take much to flush out the market's weakest hands: ""The risk is that bears finally become encouraged enough to press the issue, seize the momentum and ultimately rattle dip buyers.""

6-Mar-18,113,114.59,103.98,108.8,30097591,chase,"LONDON British American Tobacco said on Tuesday that its sweetened offer to buy the stake in Reynolds American that it did not already own had been accepted, a $49 billion deal that would create a tobacco giant with a significant presence around the world.
The purchase would create the worlds largest publicly traded tobacco business, based on net sales, and it would combine companies with brands that include Camel, Lucky Strike, Newport and Pall Mall. It comes as the industry faces a shift toward so-called next-generation products, or N.G.P.s, such as e-cigarettes and vaping products.
The agreement came nearly three months after British American Tobacco first offered to buy the 57.8 percent of Reynolds American that it did not own, at the time offering about $47 billion.
It will create a stronger, global tobacco and N.G.P. business with direct access for our products across the most attractive markets in the world, Nicandro Durante, the British American Tobacco chief executive, said in a news release . We believe this will drive continued, sustainable profit growth and returns for shareholders long into the future.
Under its cash-and-share offer, British American Tobacco would pay $59.64 a share for Reynolds American, representing a 26 percent premium over the companys closing price before the initial offer last October.
The new company would have a strong share of the market in the United States, as well as a major presence in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and South America, British American Tobacco said.
The company added that it expected $400 million in annual savings by the third year after the deal is completed.
The boards of both companies will recommend that shareholders approve the transaction, the companies said. The deal is also subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. It is expected to close in the third quarter.
The takeover agreement, which is subject to a $1 billion breakup fee, came about two and a half years after Reynolds agreed to acquire a smaller tobacco rival, Lorillard, for $27.4 billion. That deal was completed in 2015.
Reynolds American was formed more than a decade ago, when British American Tobacco merged its Brown &Williamson operations in the United States with R. J. Reynolds. The deal values Reynolds American at $81 billion based on market capitalization.

We look forward to bringing together the two companies highly complementary cultures and shared commitment to innovation and transformation in our industry, Debra A. Crew, the Reynolds American president and chief executive, said in a news release . British American Tobacco is the best partner for Reynolds Americans next phase of growth, and together the two companies will create the leading portfolio of tobacco and next-generation products for adult tobacco consumers.
Three Reynolds directors would join the British American Tobacco board after the deal closes.
The transaction would be the latest shake-up in the global tobacco industry, which saw its biggest upheaval in years with the Reynolds American-Lorillard deal in 2014. That deal required nearly a year of navigating regulatory hurdles, with the combined company selling several brands to win approval.
Reynolds American, based in Winston-Salem, N.C., has brands including Camel and Newport.
Although it was formed by the merger in 2004, the company traces its roots to the founding of Lorillard in New York City in 1760 and R. J. Reynolds in North Carolina in 1875.
Reynolds American reported sales of $10.7 billion in 2015 and employs 5,600 people.
British American Tobacco, which is based in London and was founded in 1902, has more than 200 brands in its portfolio, including Dunhill and Rothmans. It reported revenue of 13.1 billion pounds, or about $15.8 billion, in 2015 and employs more than 50,000 people.
Centerview Partners, Deutsche Bank and UBS, and the law firms Cravath, Swaine &Moore and Herbert Smith Freehills advised British American Tobacco on the proposed deal.
Goldman Sachs and the law firms Weil, Gotshal &Manges and Moore &Van Allen advised a committee of Reynolds Americans independent directors that negotiated the transaction. JPMorgan Chase and Lazard, and the law firm Jones Day, advised Reynolds American.

Kushner Cos. also disclosed Wednesday that it had recently received a separate $200 million loan from the bank.

The bank has faced questions about its dealings with Kushner Cos. following a White House meeting between its chief executive and Mr. Kushner.

On March 3, 2017, Citi Chief Executive Michael Corbat met with Mr. Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law and a senior adviser to the president. On March 31 of that year, Kushner Cos., which is controlled by members of Mr. Kushner's family, and two partner firms closed on a $325 million mortgage for a Brooklyn property with Citigroup, according to the bank.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and other lawmakers requested more information about the meeting from the bank after it was reported on by the New York Times last month.

Responding to that request, Citigroup's letter said ""the Kushner family has been a client of Citi for decades."" It added the bank started exploring the March loan in late 2016 before Mr. Corbat and Mr. Kushner met.

Mr. Corbat ""was unaware of the transaction"" until the article was published, and the loan didn't require his approval, the bank said.

""This transaction was done in the normal course of Citi's commercial real estate lending business, received the necessary credit and risk approvals without input from Mr. Corbat,and was unrelated to any discussions with Mr. Kushner,"" the bank wrote.

Mr. Corbat requested the meeting with Mr. Kushner with the purpose of discussing U.S. trade policy and the North American Free Trade Agreement, the bank said.",0

9-Mar-18,73.18,74.27,72.69,73.32,16374654,citigroup,"Bank of America Corp. has wrapped up its internal review of its $292 million loss involving troubled South African firm Steinhoff International Holdings NV and dialed back its appetite for the type of stock-based loan that caused the loss, people familiar with the matter said.

Bank of America was one of a number of global lenders that held pieces of a 1.6 billion euro ($2 billion) loan to Christo Wiese, then chairman of the South African retailer. Mr. Wiese's shares in the company served as collateral for the financing. Those shares collapsed in value last fall after the retailer, which owns Mattress Firm and the Sleepy's brand, disclosed accounting irregularities.

The bank said in a statement Tuesday that its review of the loss is finished. It said the responsible thing to do with such a loss is to ""review it carefully, see if we missed something, and apply any lessons for the future,"" adding that the ""core cause"" of the loss was due to the behavior of another party.

The review has led the bank to dial back its appetite for collateralized loans to individuals that are backed solely by a borrower's holdings of a single stock. These loans leave a bank with few good options if the stock price collapses.

The collapse in the Steinhoff share price hit Mr. Wiese's lenders hard. In addition to Bank of America, Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group disclosed losses to what was typically described as a single-name client in the fourth quarter.

Three of the biggest winners, in a bill meant to help small and midsize banks, are anything but.

The bill, championed by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, would raise the threshold for stricter oversight by the Federal Reserve to $250 billion in assets from $50 billion, a boon for midsize regional lenders. It also contains measures to reduce the burden of regulation on smaller community banks.

Thanks to this focus, it garnered enough Democratic support to pass in the Senate, despite strong opposition from the likes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who calls it a gift to Wall Street.

Another group of banks that dwarf these small lenders stands to get a healthy profit boost if the bill goes through: Bank of New York Mellon, with $372 billion of assets on its balance sheet; State Street, with $238 billion; and Northern Trust Corp., at $139 billion. These banks are more important than they might seem because they manage or have under custody trillions of dollars of assets.

These custody banks specialize in safekeeping the securities of institutional investors like mutual funds. Under the bill, they would be able to exclude some deposits they hold at the Federal Reserve or other central banks from their total assets when calculating total leverage. No other banks, big or small, get such a benefit.

The argument is that assets held at the Fed are free of risk, so banks shouldn't have to hold capital against them. The custody banks hold a disproportionate share of Fed deposits.

The impact could be quite significant. Keefe, Bruyette and Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl estimates the change could boost earnings per share at the two biggest custody banks by around 8%, assuming they use the freed-up capital to invest in other profit-generating assets.

JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, which have their own custody businesses, aren't granted the same exemption. This exclusion appears to be due to them still having negative reputations on Capitol Hill. Helping them out would jeopardize the bill's chance of passage.

Still, it makes no sense that central-bank deposits, if they are truly risk-free, be treated differently for different banks. The U.S. Treasury's report on financial regulation last year proposed that all banks be able to exclude Fed deposits from their leverage ratios. It also is jarring that such big custody banks will benefit from a bill designed to help smaller banks.

The fact that Congress narrowed the exemption to three banks that happen not to be household names says something about the current political climate. Even with Donald Trump in the White House and Republicans controlling Congress, politicians don't want to appear to be doing anything to help the most well-known Wall Street banks.",1
1-Mar-18,73.47,73.5,71.92,72.7,15131387,citigroup,"David Solomon became the heir apparent at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Monday after his main rival for the top job abruptly resigned, moves that show the Wall Street powerhouse is continuing to move beyond its trading roots.

The surprise announcement came after Goldman's board of directors last month anointed Mr. Solomon as the eventual successor to current Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, over co-President Harvey Schwartz, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Mr. Blankfein could retire as soon as year-end, though he remains firmly in control of his exit. Messrs. Schwartz, 54, and Solomon, 56, who were jointly elevated to the No. 2 role in December 2016, were the top contenders to succeed him.

The two hail from different parts of the firm. Mr. Solomon is a longtime investment banker who DJs on the side. Mr. Schwartz, a karate black belt, scaled the ranks of Goldman's trading arm on his way to becoming chief financial officer.

In choosing Mr. Solomon, Goldman is going with a business builder who is respected, if not universally loved, inside the firm. The move amounts to a bet that the coming decade will look little like the last one, as Goldman continues to evolve from a secretive trading powerhouse into a more entrepreneurial place.

The two men were told of the board's decision last week, at which point Mr. Schwartz, who was informed upon his return from a West Coast trip, said he would leave, people familiar with the matter said.

Mr. Blankfein shared the news Monday morning with the firm's management committee, a group of about 35 top officials. ""Harvey's leaving the firm,"" the typically blunt CEO said, according to people briefed on the meeting. Mr. Solomon quickly canceled a planned trip to China.

For generations, power at Goldman has swung between bankers and traders. When Mr. Blankfein, a former trading chief, took over in 2006, that business was dominant. Since the financial crisis, though, it has faltered, sending Goldman into new businesses like consumer banking and low-fee index funds in search of growth.

Those changes were seen to favor Mr. Solomon. He is known less as a superstar deal maker than a strong manager, able to prune dead weight, motivate strivers and marshal Goldman's resources behind big initiatives.

""David is a pied piper, and I mean that in the best way,"" said Chris Nassetta, CEO of Hilton Hotels Corp., who worked with Mr. Solomon at Bear Stearns. ""People want to follow him.""

Mr. Solomon came to Wall Street in the mid-1980s, selling commercial paper at Drexel Burnham Lambert. Off duty, he played social planner to a group of college friends, organizing casino outings in Atlantic City and summer rentals in the Hamptons, where roommates would wake up to find him mowing the lawn.

After a stint at Bear Stearns, Mr. Solomon joined Goldman as a rare outside partner in 1999 and set out to build a junk-debt business. In 2006 he assumed responsibility for Goldman's investment bankers, who advise companies on mergers and fundraisings.

Mr. Solomon is credited with professionalizing that division, which he ran for a decade. He had a policy of giving zero bonuses to the bottom 5% of employees, executives said. But he also spearheaded Goldman's efforts to lighten the workload for junior bankers, and took a leading role in the firm's effort to recruit and promote women. He built a debt capital-markets business that reported record revenues last year.

Mr. Schwartz, meanwhile, embodied Goldman's profitable past, having scaled the ranks of its trading division. As finance chief from 2013 to 2016, Mr. Schwartz navigated the political and market forces that reshaped banking after the crisis, and was a strong hand in the areas of risk management and regulation.

He graduated from high school in New Jersey and didn't bother applying to college, instead joining a local gym as an athletic trainer. He eventually attended Rutgers University, working as nightclub bouncer and other odd jobs to pay his way, and joined Citigroup Inc. as an operations temp in 1989.

He came to Goldman's commodities trading arm in 1997 as a derivatives salesman, helping energy and mining companies protect themselves from price swings.

By 2008, Mr. Schwartz was running the trading division. As the financial crisis unfolded, he kept the firm on the offensive while competitors pulled back. The gambit worked: Goldman's traders made $33 billion in 2009, the most profitable year on record for a Wall Street broker-dealer.

Mr. Schwartz was named CFO four years later, a move so unexpected that senior executives including the firm's heads of risk and accounting threatened to quit, according to a person familiar with the matter.

But Mr. Schwartz won over critics by overseeing an operation that avoided surprises that plagued other banks. His 18-quarter tenure as CFO is captured in pen on a pair of lime-green boxing gloves that he keeps in his office, a gift from Goldman's finance team: ""18-0, all by KO.""

As co-president, he helped shepherd the firm's consumer-lending initiative, Marcus, to its 2016 launch.

""It's been an incredible 21 years,"" he said in his final management committee meeting Monday, according to attendees. ""I've gotten more out of the firm than I put in. It's been an honor.""",1

New Chief Executive Stephen Squeri stuck to some familiar themes in his presentation during the company's annual investor day on Wednesday. He stressed the importance of the company's integrated, ""end-to-end"" business model, which includes customer cards, a global payments network and merchant services. He also touted the brand's reputation for security and customer service.

Over the course of the day, AmEx largely reiterated existing financial targets for 2018. It did, however, downgrade the amount it expects to earn in merchant fees per transaction.

On the consumer side, AmEx appears to have weathered a competitive assault from big bank rivals like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup surprisingly well. The relaunch of its flagship Platinum card last year was well-received. The company says it finished 2017 with a record number of Platinum customers who had also spent record amounts. It also renewed co-brand partnerships with Hilton Worldwide Holdings and Marriott International.

There remain reasons for concern, though. AmEx's rewards costs have been rising, but they remain low even compared with lower-end competitors. According to Credit Suisse Group, AmEx's rewards cost per dollar spent on its cards came to just 0.81% in 2017, compared with 1.1% for Capital One Financial and 1.24% for Discover Financial Services. This suggests pressure to keep enhancing rewards.

The company says its strong brand and the ""experiential value"" of its cards outweigh ""commoditized"" rewards like cash back and points. But, over the long run, money tends to talk loudest.

Second, the costs of the company's drive to expand lending to cardholders are coming into clearer view. Total provisions for credit losses rose 36% in 2017, and the company said it expects similar growth this year. Credit Suisse analyst Moshe Orenbuch notes this would put provision expenses at nearly half of pretax income this year, compared with just 25% in 2016.

The company stresses that the U.S. consumer business accounts for less than a third of its total business. But the competitive pressures in the U.S. consumer market aren't going away soon.

Leaning on its traditionally strong brand reputation isn't enough.",1

The parent company of Snapchat is planning to trim about 10% of the engineers in its employ, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday. An internal memo from the company obtained by the news site Cheddar put the total number of layoffs at 120.

Snap reported 3,069 full-time employees at the end of 2017, which was a gain of 65% from the previous year. But its pace of expansion slowed remarkably late in the year.

Minding the expense line typically isn't a bad idea for a company that, even with several favorable adjustments, lost more than $720 million last year. But investors aren't expecting Snap to cut its way into profitability.

Snap's fourth-quarter results last month were a good sign for the long term as user growth accelerated following a prolonged slowdown.

But the company also has shed nearly $3.7 billion in market value since those results after a recent redesign of Snapchat proved controversial.

Mark May of Citigroup cited a ""significant jump in negative app reviews"" when he downgraded the stock to a ""sell"" rating on Feb. 20. Snap shares lost 6% two days later after Kylie Jenner, one of the famed Kardashian clan, tweeted a criticism of the new design.

One celebrity, of course, isn't going to make or break the service. But the fact that Snap is still vulnerable to such whims indicates that those still employed by the company have a big job ahead.",0

Some investors saw Mr. Cohn's resignation as a sign that President Donald Trump was pushing forward with the steel and aluminum tariffs he promised last week and were worried that protectionist trade policies could spread. Mr. Trump will sign a proclamation to enact the tariffs this week, with ""potential carve-outs"" for Mexico, Canada and possibly other countries, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday.

Global trade disruptions could lead to ripple effects for a wide range of commodities and products, some investors fear, resulting in higher costs for companies and consumers and slower economic growth. The concerns about trade come after worries about higher interest rates sent the blue chips in February to their worst month in two years.

""We do think the aggregate risk to this more placid narrative has really gone up in recent months,"" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""Things like trade policy changes and the potential for a trade war -- those are real issues that may alter the timeline of economic growth and stability.""

Stocks rose to start the week after prominent members of the Republican Party pushed back against the tariffs, fueling bets that a widespread trade war was unlikely.

A number of companies and other countries have also voiced concerns about the tariffs in recent days, with full details yet to be announced and uncertainty surrounding negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement. The European Union on Wednesday urged Mr. Trump to rethink his planned tariffs, threatening to strike back unless he reverses course.

""You will have a disruption in growth if you get to the point where everybody is saying, 'We have no other option but to hit back,'"" said Dec Mullarkey, a managing director on the investment research team at Sun Life Investment Management.

Industrial firms that would be hurt most by higher commodities costs were among Wednesday's worst performers. Heavy-machinery maker Caterpillar fell $2.24, or 1.5%, to $151.51, weighing on the Dow.

Some U.S. bank stocks also fell as markets fretted over Mr. Cohn's departure and its implications for trade, the economy and regulation. JPMorgan Chase fell 43 cents, or 0.4%, to 114.73, while Citigroup slipped 14 cents, or 0.2%, to 73.92.

Oil prices fell 2.3%, leading to declines in the energy sector after government data showed crude stockpiles rose and U.S. production reached new heights last week. Those losses helped offset gains in the technology, health-care and real-estate sectors.

Some investors said they expect the market to recover and the global economy to remain strong, as long as an all-out trade war is avoided.

""In general, it should be a good period [for markets], but it's probably going to ping pong between these bouts of low volatility and great asset performance and short, sharp corrections that push people back on their heels when something crops up on the trade front"" or elsewhere, said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income.

Within weeks, the meetings were revamped; fewer employees were invited and those that did were expected to participate. ""It's true of everything,"" Mr. Scharf told The Wall Street Journal. ""Meetings should have as few people as possible, but all the right people.""

It is a familiar tenet to those who worked alongside Mr. Scharf at Citigroup Inc. and later JPMorgan Chase & Co., where he served for years as a top lieutenant to CEO James Dimon. Both Mr. Dimon and Citigroup's Sandy Weill leaned on a small cadre of deputies to overhaul businesses, with people that could often ""finish each other's sentences"" in rooting out bureaucracy, one former colleague said.

Mr. Scharf, who joined BNY Mellon in July, is turning to pages of the same playbook as part of a broader overhaul. He already has laid off staff, consolidated office space and overhauled executive pay. His challenge is to kick-start the bank that has been mired by slow growth and price wars that have weighed on profit.

BNY Mellon completes some of Wall Street's most vital, if boring, tasks: connecting many of the world's sellers to buyers, tracking the value of securities and safeguarding trillions of dollars in assets. Yet many of those businesses still rely heavily on legions of operations employees.

Alexander Hamilton, who founded the Bank of New York more than two centuries ago, ""left for the duel and told the bank not to change anything until he got back, and they haven't,"" one former competitor said, recounting an old joke about the custody bank.

At an investor meeting Thursday, Mr. Scharf will outline his plans for change, and details on additional cost cuts are likely.

Of BNY Mellon's 53,000 employees, some 20,000 work in operations. As the bank moves to automate processes, in time ""that number should be a fraction of what it is,"" Mr. Scharf said.

BNY Mellon aims to ride one of the biggest changes to affect the financial world in decades: the digitization of nearly every step that money takes as it flows through the global economy.

Mr. Scharf is spending heavily in technology in an effort to better harness the reams of data produced by the assets they oversee. In January, he told investors that he would plow all of this year's benefits from the new U.S. tax rules, some $250 million, into investments in technology and employees.

And then there is the dress code. It is common for Mr. Scharf to arrive at work wearing black jeans.

Mr. Scharf is eager to pick up the pace. He also has been careful not to move too quickly, sounding out some of his new colleagues on how to avoid alienating employees, people familiar with the matter said.

""Every organization can move at a different speed,"" Mr. Scharf said.",0
9-Mar-18,75.95,76.53,75.92,76.02,13398244,citigroup,"The Senate is debating a bill that would relax Dodd-Frank's chokehold on small banks, but a couple of provisions that ease capital and liquidity standards for the giants will make the financial system more vulnerable in a panic.

Tucked into Banking Chairman Mike Crapo's legislation is a directive to federal agencies to amend the ""supplementary leverage ratio"" for custodial banks by excluding deposits at a central bank. Custodial banks secure assets for clients such as large institutional investors and fund managers.

At first glance, this provision would appear to apply only to Boston-based State Street, Chicago's Northern Trust and Bank of New York Mellon. But Citigroup and J.P. Morgan also offer custodial services and are trying to join the party. You can bet others will want in too. ""As Congress has sought to make a common sense change to the way capital rules treat custody assets, we have asked that they apply that change to all custody banks to maintain a level playing field in this important business,"" a Citi spokesman said last week.

As we saw during the crisis, financial regulators are poor judges of risk. Banks had piled into investments that regulators deemed low risk such as mortgage-backed securities and sovereign debt that let them meet capital standards even while remaining highly leveraged. You know how that worked out.

So the Federal Reserve and other regulators in 2014 adopted a simple, non-risk weighted measure of equity to total assets called the supplemental leverage ratio -- 5% for global giants. Banks get no more credit for investing in Treasurys than in corporate debt. This leverage limit prevents banks from gaming capital rules and herding into putatively ""low-risk"" assets, which overall reduces systemic risk.

The big guys gripe that the Fed's capital standards are excessive. But if banks want to lend more, they can build equity. Last year Citi and J.P. Morgan each announced plans to return some $19 billion to shareholders. Big banks were undercapitalized prior to the panic and experienced losses on average equal to 6% of assets. Most have built up about that much now, though State Street, Bank of New York Mellon, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have less.

An exemption for central bank deposits would improve the leverage ratio on paper for many big banks to between 7% and 8%. So custody banks could stash their customer funds at the Fed or another central bank where they'd earn modest interest. The risk is that they will then use this dispensation to increase debt or reduce capital.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates a ""50 percent chance"" that regulators would extend the regulatory exemption to J.P. Morgan and Citi, which is probably low. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week at a Congressional hearing that ""the leverage ratio can deter banks"" from ""engaging in low-risk wholesale activities, particularly the custody banks,"" adding that ""I think we got the calibration a little bit wrong so our plan is to roll it back."" His preference would be to do so for all big banks.

The economy could use more risk-taking, and some small businesses have had trouble getting credit under the new Dodd-Frank regime. But the Senate bill would remedy this problem by reducing administrative burdens on regional and community banks where regulatory compliance has gratuitously diverted resources from customer services. Regional and community banks have on average a leverage ratio of 8.7%.

If central bank deposits are exempted from the leverage ratio, why not Treasurys or municipal debt? Speaking of which, big banks are also pleading for more latitude under the Fed's liquidity rules. The Senate bill obliges by directing the Fed to classify investment-grade municipal debt as ""high quality liquid assets.""

Banks love muni debt because of its tax exemption and supposed security, though bankruptcies in Puerto Rico, Detroit and Stockton, Calif., betrayed this conceit. Muni bonds are not actively traded in the secondary market, and prices are opaque. The 1975 Tower amendment also exempts municipal securities from mandatory investor disclosures.

Government finances can quickly deteriorate. Recall the Orange County bankruptcy in 1994 that resulted from bad bond bets amid rising interest rates. During a market meltdown, banks would find it hard to unload munis. One lesson from the last crisis was that even supposedly liquid, high-grade assets can become illiquid when investors panic, markets lock up and prices fall.

The Senate bill would encourage banks to pile into munis and make it cheaper for states and cities to borrow -- thus encouraging more government leverage. Governments and financial investors are often co-dependent, but Senators ought to resist enabling both.",1
9-Mar-18,74.95,76.37,74.6,76.11,15939242,citigroup,"WASHINGTON -- Four financial companies, including Citigroup Inc. and online lender Kabbage Inc., said they have formed a consortium to address the cybersecurity risks of financial-technology firms, a sign of the industry's growing links to traditional banks and insurers.

The consortium, which was created in response to recommendations in a World Economic Forum report released Tuesday, also includes Zurich Insurance Group AG and Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., a U.S. clearinghouse.

""There are a lot of these fintechs popping up left and right,"" said Matthew Blake, head of the financial and monetary system initiative at the World Economic Forum. ""The financial system is becoming much more modular,"" he added, noting that the ""one-stop shop"" model of banking is being challenged by new types of financial services firms.

The group's first objective will be to establish criteria to enable fintech companies to evaluate the level of their cybersecurity defenses. The World Economic Forum report called for the creation of such criteria as well as a common metric to measure fintech firms' cybersecurity exposure. Those steps would allow traditional financial institutions to better evaluate the level of risk they are exposing themselves to when partnering with fintech firms, Mr. Blake suggested.

""Technologists are not incentivized to focus on cybersecurity upfront in the design phase,"" said Mr. Blake. ""Really innovative companies [have] some cybersecurity preparedness but not to the level of what an incumbent company would offer,"" he said.

9-Mar-18,74.14,74.23,73.127,74.11,10878604,citigroup,"WASHINGTON -- Bipartisan legislation expected to clear the Senate as early as this week has just one provision that is set to directly benefit the nation's megabanks: a section aimed at making it easier for them to buy state and local bonds.

The provision, championed by Citigroup Inc. and other large banks, would ease a new rule aimed at ensuring banks can raise enough cash during a financial-market meltdown to fund their operations for 30 days, requiring them to hold more cash or securities that are easily salable.

Under federal banking rules approved in 2014, those ""high quality liquid assets"" included cash, Treasury bonds and corporate debt but not municipal debt. Banks like to hold municipal bonds because of their safety and tax advantages.

The Senate on Tuesday voted, 67-32, to formally begin debate on the bill, which primarily benefits small and medium-size banks, easily reaching the 60 votes needed and signaling that the measure has enough support from Democrats to pass by a comfortable margin. The legislation was backed by 16 Democrats and one independent, Maine Sen. Angus King, bucking Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and 31 other Democrats who opposed the procedural vote.

Including the municipal-bond provision in the deregulatory bill was a priority for the nation's biggest banks that buy a lot of municipal securities as investments. A Citigroup lobbyist recently told a Senate staffer that the firm would be pleased if easing the treatment of municipal debt under the bank-funding rule was the one thing it could accomplish during the current Congress, said a person familiar with the conversation.

State and local officials have praised the move, saying their securities could suffer if banks begin to shun them.

A Citigroup spokesman said the bond provision ""is supported by a wide array of groups focused on helping cities and states address critical infrastructure needs.""

While the provision is a victory for Citigroup, the biggest U.S. banks haven't lobbied extensively on the Senate bill, congressional aides said. Big firms have spent billions of dollars to comply with postcrisis rules and generally aren't eager to tear them down.

Analysts have said changing the rule for municipal products would be a mistake because it would erode the core of a bank-safety rule put in place after the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. While municipal securities have relatively low default rates, they are traded thinly and shouldn't count as liquid assets, critics say.

""It's an outrageously bad idea,"" said Phillip Swagel, a professor at the University of Maryland who served in the George W. Bush Treasury, characterizing the provision as an implicit federal guarantee of the municipal market. In the next crisis, banks will have trouble selling their municipal securities, freezing up the market for them and requiring the government to step in to backstop it, he predicted.

While lawmakers agreed to include the municipal-debt measure, they rebuffed Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase & Co. efforts to water down a separate postcrisis capital requirement known as the supplementary leverage ratio.

That regulation effectively restricts banks from making too many loans without adding new capital, forcing firms to maintain a proportion of capital to fund their assets.

The legislation includes a provision to diminish the leverage ratio in a way that lawmakers say would only benefit financial institutions primarily engaged in ""custody services,"" in which they hold assets on behalf of other banks. Citigroup and JPMorgan, global banks that don't fit the definition but still offer custody services, have argued it is unfair to carve out certain banks from the provision and not others.

""As Congress has sought to make a common sense change to the way capital rules treat custody assets, we have asked that they apply that change to all custody banks to maintain a level playing field in this important business,"" a Citigroup spokesman said.

Senate aides said lawmakers crafted a delicate compromise that can pass the chamber and don't want to broaden the bill with more provisions helping big banks and risk having the bill fail.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has said that the Fed would prefer that Congress allow regulators to rewrite the leverage ratio rule. Instead, the bill directs regulators to exclude certain assets from the calculation of the leverage ratio for custody banks.

Lenders Could Get

Help From Senate

The Senate is voting on a bill as early as this week that would make the largest changes to financial regulatory law since 2010, when the Dodd-Frank Act passed. Supporters say it will help small lenders without undoing Dodd-Frank's core tenets. Opponents say the bill cuts protections against consumer abuses and financial crises. Here's what's in Senate Bill 2155.

Help for Regional Banks

-- Dodd-Frank said larger banks must follow stricter rules than smaller ones. It drew the line at $50 billion in assets, leaving about 40 of the roughly 5,670 U.S. banks above it. The bill would effectively raise that threshold to $250 billion in assets, leaving 12 banks facing mandatory annual ""stress tests"" and other hurdles.

Help for Big Banks

-- The bill would make it easier for big banks to buy bonds from state and local governments.

-- It would lower a capital requirement called the leverage ratio for State Street Corp. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp., two large ""custody"" banks that predominantly hold clients' assets for safekeeping, rather than lending out client money like traditional banks. Some observers say other big banks in the custody business, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., may end up qualifying for this help.

Help for Small Lenders

-- Small banks would be exempt from the Volcker rule, which bans banks from making speculative bets.

-- Small banks would file shorter financial reports with regulators, be examined less often and be released from some capital rules as long as they maintain a relatively high ratio of equity to assets.",1
9-Mar-18,73.18,74.075,72.86,73.92,14654894,citigroup,"The Senate this week will debate a bipartisan bill that would relax some of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law's blunderbuss regulations. Progressives are denouncing the modest reforms as gifts to Wall Street, though the irony is that Dodd-Frank has been a boon for the biggest banks.

Like ObamaCare, Dodd-Frank was a product of the Pelosi Congress and faith in the genius of central planners. The law enshrined too-big-to-fail while writing vague language that has led to hundreds of new rules, some measuring thousands of pages, that are the bane of small lenders and their customers.

Ms. Warren and Ohio's Sherrod Brown are leading opposition to Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo's bill that has 12 Democratic co-sponsors. ""The bank lobbyists are getting ready to pop champagne and light their cigars,"" Ms. Warren says. Bankers wish they partied as much as Ms. Warren says they do, but her claims bear little relation to the actual bill.

Mainly, the Crapo bill eases administrative burdens on 5,000 some community banks that make up about 98% of financial institutions but only 15% of assets. Small lenders would be exempt from Dodd-Frank's requirement to disclose loan demographic data by census track, income, race, age and gender.

Banks under $10 billion in assets would be exempt from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's qualified mortgage rule and its rigid underwriting standards and loan design. Progressives say the exemption could lead to another housing bubble. But only about 3% of single-family loans held by community banks were seriously delinquent during the first quarter of 2011 compared with more than 16% at banks with more than $1 trillion in assets, according to the American Enterprise Institute's Ed Pinto.

As ever, the real danger lies at the taxpayer-backed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which securitize mortgages. The government-sponsored enterprises are exempt from key provisions of the CFPB rule and other underwriting standards under Dodd-Frank. The Crapo bill does nothing to reduce their taxpayer safety net, which is a shame.

The Warren left is most exercised by an increase in the bank asset threshold for ""enhanced prudential standards"" to $250 billion from $50 billion. This would liberate a couple dozen regional banks from too-big-to-fail rules designed to prevent failures among large systemically important financial institutions.

The standards are cumbersome, and compliance is costly. For instance, banks must establish ""procedures for monitoring intraday liquidity risk exposure."" This is like requiring all 50 states to develop earthquake-response plans when the risk is confined to a few. Mid-size outfits like Zions Bank of Salt Lake City didn't cause the 2008 financial panic. And even Barney Frank has said that applying the same liquidity and stress-testing requirements to banks with $50 billion in assets as those with more than $1 trillion was a ""mistake.""

Smaller banks are better capitalized than large institutions in large part because they don't benefit from a government safety net. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Vice Chairman Thomas Hoenig says regional banks have on average 200 basis points more in tangible equity than global giants.

While J.P. Morgan and Citigroup can afford to hire hundreds of compliance officers, Dodd-Frank's burdens handicap smaller competitors. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said last month at the Economic Club of Washington that ""Dodd-Frank is fine"" and ""none of us are trying to touch it,"" though he wants lower capital standards for his bank.

The Federal Reserve is currently recalibrating capital requirements, which if anything ought to be higher for the big banks that have only 6% of tangible equity -- far less than the 10% that Mr. Hoenig says could be needed to withstand another panic.

One problem in the Crapo bill is a provision that eases capital standards by an effective 20% to 25% for so-called custody banks by excluding their central bank deposits. These banks required as much as $90 billion a day in emergency lending to cover funding losses during the crisis, and Mr. Hoenig warns that this carve-out could cause the giants to demand the same treatment.

Perhaps the bill's biggest defects are that it doesn't touch too-big-to-fail or the CFPB's unconstitutional design. The House has passed a better reform, and some of those ideas could make it into a House-Senate conference. One idea is to make the CFPB a bipartisan commission, which should elate Democrats who say Mick Mulvaney has defanged the agency.

The dozen Democrats who have broken with the Warren wing need a political winner after voting against the GOP tax cuts. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also wants bank cash for his Senate candidates, which is why he's giving them a pass. Count it as progress that at least a few Democrats are beginning to dissent from Ms. Warren.",0
12-Mar-18,74.93,74.99,73.75,74.06,14891169,citigroup,"Albertsons Cos. and Rite Aid Corp. are bringing on a retail veteran to steer the grocery and pharmacy chains through their complex, roughly $24 billion merger.

Executives of the new company Monday named Jim Donald their president and chief operating officer. The 64-year-old former Starbucks Corp. chief executive was most recently CEO of the Extended Stay America Inc. hotel chain and sits on the board of chocolate supplier Barry Callebaut.

Albertsons Chief Executive Bob Miller said in an interview that Mr. Donald's decades of experience at many different kinds of retailers will help him stitch together Albertsons's and Rite Aid's disparate businesses.

""The skills he's acquired by doing those things will be a plus,"" Mr. Miller said.

Mr. Donald's tenure at Starbucks was bumpy, and he was pushed out in 2008 over concerns the coffee chain had overexpanded. He didn't respond to a request for comment. Mr. Miller said many CEOs struggled to stabilize consumer companies after the recession.

Mr. Donald also held leadership roles at Walmart Inc., Albertsons and other regional grocery chains in the past, and served on Rite Aid's board.

Retailers are looking to deals outside their comfort zones to defend themselves on one front against giants like Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. and on another against fickle customers who have more choices for filing their grocery carts and prescriptions.

Less than half of shoppers in a recent survey said one supermarket is their primary source for consumer products, according to the Food Marketing Institute trade group, down from 67% in 2005.

Bankers expect midsize retailers in particular to pursue more mergers. Albertsons and Rite Aid are ranked third in their respective sectors. Retail mergers also are getting larger. U.S. retail deals last year averaged $447 million, the second highest in more than a decade, according to Dealogic.

A Citigroup report last month predicted the number of deals will be higher this year after new federal tax legislation handed companies more cash to potentially deploy. Activist shareholders also are pressuring companies to make big bets

Deals between companies in different sectors can pose greater challenges than a merger between close competitors. Executives can struggle to synchronize everything from supply chains to loyalty programs between two companies that may not completely overlap, said J. Neely, managing director, Accenture Strategy, global M&A lead.

""The path to value is much more complex,"" he said.

Some grocery analysts worry Albertsons and Rite Aid could emerge as a big company without a unique identity that would fail to appeal to shoppers and persuade shareholders to stay on board.

""My main concern would be that this is a deal that primarily is about size,"" said Kevin Coupe, a supermarket analyst who writes the MorningNewsBeat industry newsletter.

Moody's Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings, meanwhile, said the company could struggle to generate profit while working off a high debt load.

""Albertson's is buried in debt,"" said Rite Aid shareholder Jonathan Martin, who intends to vote against the merger, which the companies hope to conclude this summer. ""It's going completely backwards for Rite Aid shareholders.""

The combined company's debt is projected to be more than six times earnings before expenses, a high level, according to Moody's.

Mr. Miller said the company has enough cash and that based on the response he received on a recent investor roadshow, he believes shareholders will approve the deal.

Executives believe the combined company will benefit from selling shoppers everything from migraine medication to meal kits in one store. Customers who shop for groceries while picking up prescriptions spend more than three times more than supermarket shoppers who only buy groceries, according to figures that Albertsons executives presented recently to shareholders.

Albertsons aims to make another acquisition in the next year or so, people familiar with the matter said. They said Cerberus Capital Management LP, the private-equity firm that owns a majority of Albertsons, won't sell its stake in the combined company soon and sees Rite Aid as a profit driver.

Cross-sector mergers also face less regulatory scrutiny than tie-ups between competitors, said Henry Su, a partner at Constantine Cannon in Washington D.C., and former staff attorney for the Federal Trade Commission. Both Albertsons and Rite Aid have faced regulatory pushback during past merger efforts with other partners.",1
12-Mar-18,73.07,74.94,72.7,74.42,16814605,citigroup,"Sallie Krawcheck has been a saver since she was a child. In third grade, she started putting away the 25 cents an hour her dad paid her to do filing in his office. Later, she graduated to babysitting and working in the family store. When she was a sophomore in high school, her parents -- ""solidly middle class"" -- borrowed money from her to replace their hot-water heater.

""By the way,"" she says, ""I charged them interest for repayment. Not in a mean way. But, hey, it's not in the bank, and it was the '70s, so you would really earn something in the bank -- inflation and all that. I was always the one who was most aware of and confident with money.""

After college, she became a fixture on Wall Street, with high-profile leadership roles at both Citigroup and Merrill Lynch. Now she's the chief executive and co-founder of Ellevest, a digital financial-investment firm for women.

For years, Ms. Krawcheck says she thought the idea of a woman-focused investment firm was a bad idea that would lead to ""remedial financial education."" But over time, she came to see that women are motivated differently from men, and that the industry is focused far more on the way men view investing.

""Women are not as energized by outperforming the market or picking the latest stock or getting that latest money manager and talking about it at cocktail parties as gentlemen are,"" she says. ""Women are more about, 'I want to reach my goals. What I'm really interested in is can I retire well, not whether I'm going to outperform when the euro is weak versus the yen.' ""

She says she'd like to think that co-founding Ellevest will prove to be the best investment she has ever made. But meanwhile, here's a look at what she says are the best and worst investments in her rearview mirror.

Best Bet: A house in the Hamptons

INVESTMENT: $9.5 million of cashed-out Citigroup stock

GAINS: Around $7.5 million in unrealized real-estate value

In 2004, when Ms. Krawcheck was Citigroup's chief financial officer, she wanted to buy a vacation home in the Hamptons, the famed stretch of exclusive beach communities along Long Island's south shore. She zeroed in on a house in Quogue. To make the purchase, she decided to cash out $9.5 million of her Citigroup stock. That was something of a faux pas in the C-suite.

""It was really frowned upon at Citigroup to sell stock as a senior leader,"" she says. ""We had an informal-that-was-sort-of-formal blood oath where you didn't sell stock.""

She did it anyway. She cashed out when Citi was around $40 a share. Today the stock is at the equivalent of about $7.50, after adjusting for a 1-for-10 reverse share split in 2011.

Meanwhile, the house in Quogue was recently appraised at $17 million.

THE TAKEAWAY: ""The real takeaway, of course, is diversity, diversity, diversity,"" she says. ""I diversified away from Citigroup stock and into real estate.""

Her portfolio at the time wasn't nearly as diversified as it should have been, she says. Citigroup was her biggest asset ""by a good measure."" Her financial adviser at the time said she could survive a hit to her Citi stock, but so much of her other assets were tied up in equities, too, leaving her far too exposed.

""Look,"" Ms. Krawcheck says, ""stocks are wonderful, bonds are fantastic, [but] a home is your heart,"" she says. ""I wanted that home for my children to have a place outside of the city to go every weekend and summers.""

Worst Bet: Bank of America

INVESTMENT: $1 million

LOSSES: About $500,000 and an incalculable amount of time, energy and lost wages

In 2009, Ms. Krawcheck was hired to lead Merrill Lynch Wealth Management eight months after the company was purchased by Bank of America. At the time, she says, she saw it as more than the opportunity to lead a storied financial institution. It was a chance to help dig the company, industry and country out of the financial crisis, ""and to really make some small part of history.""

To show that she was committed, she bought $1 million of Bank of America stock.

""If I was going to work at the company, I wanted to be all in,"" she says.

""I wanted to be financially committed to it. I wanted to be emotionally committed to it. I wanted to have the [Merrill Lynch] bull on the hat.""

Unfortunately, she says, ""they weren't as committed to me as I was to them.""

In 2011, Bank of America let her go as part of a reorganization. No longer with the company, she ditched the stock, which had fallen roughly 50%, from about $16 to near $8, and took a $500,000 loss.

THE TAKEAWAY: Ms. Krawcheck says the sourness of the investment was about more than the loss of the stock value. The purchase represented a career move that turned out not to be as rewarding as she expected.

Ms. Krawcheck says that when she looks back on the Bank of America purchase, like other investment milestones in her life, the gains and losses are never sorted out solely on paper.

""The investments are broader than just these monetary things,"" she says. ""The home is not just a portfolio holding, but a real home. Ellevest is not just a monetary investment, but a sort of life investment.

""So, for me,"" Ms. Krawcheck says, ""these things aren't as cut and dried as if I had bought IBM but forgot to sell it.""

12-Mar-18,73.17,73.87,71.881,73.68,21061225,citigroup,"Blackstone Group LP Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman took home at least $800 million in 2017, one of the largest paydays ever at a publicly traded company and the latest affirmation of Wall Street's postcrisis rebound.

The haul, detailed Thursday in a regulatory filing, underscores the ascendancy of firms that manage private investment funds for institutions and the wealthy. Blackstone, which collects fees for managing clients' money and keeps a slice of investment gains, has benefited lately from robust markets for stocks, debt and real estate as well as banks' retreat from businesses such as specialty lending, into which Blackstone has expanded.

It's likely that Mr. Schwarzman, 71 years old, took home significantly more than the $800 million disclosed by the firm. Over the past five years, his position has yielded him more than $3.2 billion, largely in dividends and fund payouts. Mr. Schwarzman is known to remark that his salary, $350,000, is similar to the starting pay for the firm's greenest investment professionals.

The sums paid Mr. Schwarzman rank with some of the largest gains in corporate history. In 1987, junk-bond pioneer Michael Milken was paid more than $550 million raising debt that fueled the corporate takeovers on which the likes of KKR & Co. and Blackstone were built. Two decades later, hedge-fund manager John Paulson pocketed $5 billion when his fund's huge wager against the subprime mortgage market paid off during the foreclosure crisis.

Compensation for Wall Street chiefs and deal makers has been on the rise in recent years alongside major stock indexes. The heads of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley collectively received about $126 million, the highest annual tally since 2006, the year before financial markets melted down. On average, the banks' chief executive officers were paid $25.3 million apiece, up 17% from 2016, securities filings show.

Beyond Wall Street, Silicon Valley and the shale boom have showered company founders with huge paydays.

Facebook Inc. founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg had a $3.3 billion payday in 2013 from exercised stock options.

Stock awards paid out $1.1 billion to Richard D. Kinder, a co-founder of pipeline company Kinder Morgan Inc., in 2011.

For Blackstone and its rivals, such as KKR and Apollo Global Management LLC, the soaring stock market has enabled them to profitably sell shares of companies they own while rising real-estate prices have created an outlet to unload assets as well. The gains have enabled these firms' founders to consistently reap nine-figure annual paydays from dividends and investment profits.

Blackstone last year sold a big chunk of its Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. stock, pushing its profits on the 2007 hotel takeover to about $14 billion. Early in the year, it listed shares of its Invitation Homes Inc., the country's largest rental homeowner by number of houses.

KKR's founding cousins, Henry Kravis and George Roberts, each collected more than $170 million in 2017. Apollo's Leon Black took home $209 million last year, while co-founders Joshua Harris and Marc Rowan received $132 million and $101 million, respectively.

Pension managers and others have flocked to these firms' funds in hopes of bolstering returns weakened by years of historically low yields on other investments.

Investors committed $453 billion to private-equity funds and $107 billion to private debt funds in 2017, both records, according to data provider Preqin.

Mr. Schwarzman and a partner founded Blackstone in 1985 as a merger advisory business with $400,000 and a secretary. At the end of 2017, it managed $434.1 billion. For the first time, Blackstone did not disclose profits generated by the personal investments in its funds by him and other top executives. In past years, the firm has disclosed such payments, ranging from $11 million to $85 million.

Blackstone said in its filing that it paid its roughly 2,360 employees a median salary of $218,449.

Some are skeptical that the large paydays for top Wall Street executives are fully justified at a time of soft wage growth and concern over wealth inequality.

""Does that mean these individuals performed better? No, it just shows they were in the right place at the right time,"" said Rosanna Landis Weaver, who heads executive compensation research at shareholder advocacy firm As You Sow.",0
15-Mar-18,75.5,75.935,73.2,73.66,23803242,citigroup,"Part of the grip central bankers have on markets comes from their mystique. The Federal Reserve holds sway over the price of money, which gives it hard power. But the Fed's soft power is almost as valuable: Its pronouncements on the future of the economy provide the baseline for investor forecasts, and not only because they are trying to work out what the Fed will do with interest rates.

The Fed's aura of invincibility has been dented over the past decade. Yet those listening to new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testify to Congress this week showed little willingness to question his foreknowledge about the economy.

He expressed confidence that the economy has strengthened this year, and traders took his words as a sign of a hawkish shift, pushing up the estimated chances for four rate increases this year higher than for two increases for the first time. (The median forecast of Fed policy makers is for three increases, still the most likely outcome priced into federal-funds futures.)

There are a few reasons to cast doubt on Mr. Powell's belief that the economy has strengthened this year. More broadly, investors should shrug off the idea that the Fed has any special insight into what will happen a year from now. Central-bank prognostications should be treated not as a guide to the economy, but merely as a guide to how officials might react to what happens.

A month ago, the market consensus had already shifted to a belief in synchronized global growth and a much stronger U.S. economy in the short run. But data since then have begun to disappoint, and while it is far too soon to dismiss the idea of faster growth, it doesn't seem to have arrived as quickly as was first thought.

The clearest sign comes from the Atlanta Fed's ""GDP Now."" Its econometricians use incoming data to build a live forecast of the current quarter's growth rate. Strong surveys pushed it to predict first-quarter growth of 5.4% at the start of February, but it is now predicting just 2.6%, dragged down in part by weaker housing and durable-goods orders.

The Atlanta Fed prediction will change as more data come in, but at the moment it is in line with the first estimate of fourth-quarter GDP, which was itself revised slightly lower to 2.5% this week.

We seem to be back in the familiar wait-and-see story of strong survey data not being followed through -- yet -- in actual economic decisions. Stronger growth will probably come, but it isn't obvious that there is much more reason to believe it today than at the start of the year.

Citigroup's economic-surprise index shows this clearly. What it classifies as ""soft"" data such as surveys have been coming in well above expectations, while ""hard"" data have been more mixed, with disappointing retail sales, housing and capital-goods orders offset by the strong jobs market.

Continued moderate growth isno reason for gloom. Neither, though, is it a reason to raise the estimated chances of four rate increases and push up Treasury yields. If we assume Mr. Powell has no special insight into where the economy is going, the question is whether his comments should lead us to think the Fed will be more hawkish under his leadership. The answer is no. He said nothing Tuesday to change what Fed watchers call the ""reaction function,"" how the Fed will respond to any given economic environment. He just said he thought the economic environment was stronger, and an unchanged reaction function would lead to tighter monetary policy if he turns out to be correct.

Mr. Powell's and the Fed's reaction functions matter a lot, but his view of the economy will be proved right or wrong long before the Fed has to decide on a fourth rate increase in the fourth quarter of the year.

Mr. Powell's assessment of the jobs market should further undermine the notion that the Fed has a crystal ball. He said both that the natural rate of unemployment was ""somewhere in the low 4s"" and that the median Fed policy-maker forecast of 4.6% ""sounds about right to me."" The explanation lies in uncertainty: ""it could be 5 and it could be 3 1/2,"" he told the House.

Investors seeking certainty are looking for the wrong thing, but it is refreshing to have it spelled out quite so clearly. The big question in the U.S. jobs market is whether there are lots of discouraged and part-time employees ready to rejoin the workforce as the economy strengthens, limiting wage pressures. The Fed's view: ""The only way to know is to, is to find out,"" Mr. Powell said.

Investors can't wait. Ifnext week's nonfarm-payrolls reportbrings a repeat of January's surprisingly strong wage figures, it would push up inflation expectations, lead to another bond selloff and probably hurt stocks again. On this, as so much else, investors need to form their own opinions, not rely on central bankers.",1
15-Mar-18,76.6,77.13,75.45,75.49,19329866,citigroup,"SALT LAKE CITY -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has come to Main Street.

In a glass-walled tower in Utah's capital, hundreds of Goldman employees are building what amounts to one of the world's most ambitious consumer-finance startups.

Their address, 111 Main St., stands as a symbol of the changes afoot inside the firm, better known as an elite adviser to big companies and billionaires. Struggling to make money in the postcrisis world, Goldman is pushing into businesses it once dismissed as pedestrian and gimmicky, assembling a suite of banking products for the middle class it hopes will power growth.

Goldman 18 months ago began making online loans of a few thousand dollars under the brand Marcus, named after founder Marcus Goldman. Individuals once needed $10 million to get the attention of Goldman's elite private bankers. Today, customers can open a Marcus savings account with as little as $1.

New initiatives under way include checkout-counter loans for shoppers, wealth management and household-budgeting tools for the masses as well as insurance, mortgages and car loans, according to people familiar with the plans.

Goldman is scooping up financial-technology startups and pitching its bank accounts to Fortune 500 companies as an employee perk, much as they offer gym memberships or health insurance. Seeking customers, Goldman -- so secretive its name doesn't appear on its headquarters -- sent out 178 million pieces of direct mail last year and bought television ads during the NFL playoffs, a first for the firm.

In October, it rented a Manhattan lounge and hired an improv-comedy troupe to riff on consumer debt. Guests ate truffle ""macaroni and fees"" and artisanal doughnuts and took home scented candles bearing Goldman's logo.

The consumer-banking push is a high-stakes bet for Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman's CEO since 2006. A former metals salesman, he rose to power before the financial crisis by pushing Goldman's traders into ever-riskier territory. During the crisis, the firm's reputation took a hit when it was cast as a central villain behind the mortgage meltdown. Today, as trading profits dwindle under new regulations and market shifts, Mr. Blankfein's legacy hinges on the firm's ability to make money in more mundane ways.

Last year, he called a few Marcus borrowers to thank them personally for their business. He wades weekly through customer complaints that find their way to his email inbox, forwarding the thorniest to Stephen Scherr, a former investment banker who oversees the consumer push.

Marcus has lent $2.5 billion so far and has 350,000 customers across loans and savings accounts. It employs about 700 people in New York, Salt Lake and Dallas reporting to Harit Talwar, who joined in 2015 from Discover Financial Services.

""Yes, we have ambitions,"" Mr. Talwar said in an interview on the 26th floor of Goldman's Manhattan headquarters, where a popcorn machine sits in the corner and borrower testimonials hang on the walls. He was sporting Allbirds, a knit woolen sneaker popular in Silicon Valley -- the footwear equivalent of a hoodie. A sign on the conference-room door marked it as the meeting spot for ""Project Cookie,"" one of several code-named initiatives the Marcus team is pursuing.

""The consumer is at the center of everything we do,"" Mr. Talwar said. ""If we can ease pain-points in a way that is profitable for the firm, then we will consider it.""

The epicenter is Salt Lake City. Two blocks from the temple of the Mormon Church, which happens to be the bank's landlord, headset-clad customer-service representatives answer questions from small-time borrowers.

On the firm's New York trading desks, new employees dream of being named a Goldman partner. On Main Street in Salt Lake City, they vie for ""Big Bird"" status, a top title on the floor earned through positive customer feedback.

Banking giants such as Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have balance sheets and customer rolls that Goldman can't match. Online startups face less regulation. Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google have an edge in recruiting top talent and leeway from investors to enter new businesses at will.

""We don't take them lightly,"" Discover CFO Mark Graf said of Goldman at a recent industry conference. ""But we're not tossing and turning in our beds at night.""

Retail banking may be a simple corner of financial services, but it has tripped up firms with longer track records than Goldman. Plus, the bank is getting into consumer credit at a time when loan losses are on the rise at competitors.

Goldman has sunk $500 million into the consumer business as it slashes costs elsewhere and struggles to boost profitability. And even if Marcus works, it will be a blip on the bottom line for years: The company projects the business will generate about $450 million in pretax income over the next three years, just 1% of what analysts expect from the firm overall.

Still, consumer lending is more profitable than many of Goldman's other activities, particularly trading, which can no longer rely on vast borrowings to boost returns. Goldman estimates Marcus loans will produce a return on equity in the high teens, compared with Goldman's firmwide figure of 9.2% over the past three years. And retail deposits give Goldman more-stable funding at a lower cost than relying on loans secured by its holdings of securities.

Goldman must learn softer skills as it works to cover crisis-era reputational bruises and put on a friendly face, or at least a friendly voice on the phone. ""This is new territory,"" said Darin Cline, a former Navy pilot who runs operations in Salt Lake City.

Walking the floor in Western boots and helicopter cuff links, he ensures that calls are answered by a live person within 30 seconds. ""We know we have to get this right,"" he said.

The consumer business was born in the summer of 2014 in the Hamptons, according to people who were there, when a half-dozen executives gathered for a strategy session at the weekend home of Gary Cohn, Goldman's then-No. 2 executive who later left the firm to join the Trump administration. Goldman's revenues had been flat.

At a picnic table in the yard, the group asked: Where could Goldman grow? They landed on consumer lending.

Goldman dominated the institutional end of finance, as an adviser to corporate CEOs and trading partner to hedge-fund managers. It ignored retail banking, which executives deemed small-time. Longtime finance chief David Viniar for years kept a toaster in his office as a reminder of Main Street gimmicks to avoid.

But without expensive branch networks and legacy systems, Goldman executives believed they could outmaneuver large commercial banks. Meanwhile, the firm's $900 billion balance sheet would be an advantage over thinly capitalized online-lending startups.

Marcus launched in 2016, offering personal loans of a few thousand dollars, primarily to refinance credit-card debt. Goldman considered names including eQuipt and Clarifi, trademarking both, before one of its executives passed by a portrait, hanging outside Mr. Blankfein's office, of the firm's founder, a German immigrant who in 1869 opened a one-room office on Manhattan's Pine Street.

New products are coming. First up, according to people familiar with them, is ""point-of-sale"" credit, small loans offered to retail customers at checkout in stores and online. Shoppers borrowed $226 billion for purchases last year, charging the vast majority of it to their credit cards, according to consulting firm First Annapolis.

Goldman aims to siphon off some of that business by striking partnerships with big retailers to offer Marcus loans, which charge on average about 5 percentage points less than plastic.

In October, the firm hired Citigroup Inc.'s head of store credit cards. He was given the task of finding similar partnerships for Goldman.

The bank is in talks with Apple Inc. to finance iPhone sales, The Wall Street Journal reported this month. It has reached out to large retailers including Amazon about extending credit for consumer purchases, and is looking for ways to lend for vacations, home furnishings and elective medical procedures, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Goldman has also explored a mass home-mortgage business and auto lending, though it remains wary of the potential public-relations pitfalls in both markets, the people said.

In perhaps its most dramatic foray, Goldman is building a digital wealth-management platform that it plans to roll out this year, the people familiar with the matter said. Known as robo advisers, these tools use computer algorithms to buy and sell stocks and bonds for ultralow fees, though Goldman is likely to supplement its digital advice with human brokers, the people said.

On the other side of the ledger, Goldman is expanding an online savings-account business it acquired from General Electric Co. in 2016. Paying some of the highest interest rates available, it has added $8 billion to the roughly $9 billion in deposits that came over from GE. Goldman has said the business will begin offering savings accounts in the U.K. this year.

Building products is one thing. Finding customers is another. Goldman sent out about as many pieces of direct mail in 2017 as Bank of America, according to Mintel Comperemedia, a research firm. It has joined with Fidelity Investments and Intuit Inc., a maker of tax-preparation and accounting software for small-business owners, to pitch loans to their users.

Ayco, a financial-planning service Goldman acquired in 2003, since last fall has built websites for 70 companies including International Business Machines Corp. and General Motors Co. that help rank-and-file employees understand and manage their finances, executives said. The goal is eventually to plug in Goldman's wealth-management services, 401(k) offerings and other Marcus offerings, pitching them to hundreds of thousands of potential customers.

To build these new products, Goldman has made a flood of outside hires, many of whom don't fit the mold of its blue-blooded bankers and traders. Marcus's head of marketing, Dustin Cohn, spent a decade at PepsiCo Inc.'s Gatorade division and underwear retailer Jockey International Inc. The division's chief systems architect, ex-PayPal Holdings Inc. executive Greg Berry, has a nose ring. When advised to wear a suit to a Goldman orientation session, he showed up in a purple jacket, silver bow tie and Converse tennis shoes.

Goldman is on a shopping spree in Silicon Valley, breaking with its longstanding aversion to acquisitions. It spent around $20 million to acquire Honest Dollar, a nine-month-old 401(k) startup, in 2016, according people familiar with the deal. It is in talks to acquire Clarity Money, a personal-budgeting app, for a price in the high eight figures, according to people familiar with the matter -- an eyebrow-raising valuation for a startup that had 500,000 users as of September.

Some engineering hires have privately grumbled about Goldman's stuffy culture and technology limitations. When coders hired last year from a lending startup asked to use Slack, a group-messaging app popular in Silicon Valley, Goldman's compliance team rejected the request, pointing them to a stodgier alternative, Microsoft Corp.'s Lync. Honest Dollar's founder left last year.

Meanwhile, some of Goldman's investment banking clients in Silicon Valley are bristling as a trusted adviser turns into a rival. The then-CEO of LendingClub Corp. phoned Mr. Cohn -- Goldman's then-No. 2 -- to complain after he learned about Marcus, according to people familiar with the episode. His gripe: Goldman had taken LendingClub public -- a plum assignment that gave it access to the lender's strategies -- without mentioning it was building a competitor.

A few months after that phone call, to help build Marcus from scratch, Goldman hired a top LendingClub operations executive: Mr. Cline.",1
14-Mar-18,77.52,77.8752,76.35,76.38,19977213,citigroup,"A major commodities index posted its 10th straight session of gains on Monday, another sign that investors have shrugged off recent market volatility and are diving back into risky assets.

The S&P GSCI Index, which tracks the prices of 24 commodities, has been moving in tandem with global stock markets since last summer as money managers look to capitalize on accelerating global economic growth. The index has risen 5.9% from its Feb. 9 low, with some of the most actively traded raw materials such as oil and copper rebounding following drops alongside stocks earlier this month.

Those and other commodities benefit from stronger economic growth because they serve as building blocks for everything from houses and office buildings to automobiles and smartphones. Higher levels of industrial activity, low unemployment and bustling shipping routes tend to buoy demand for petroleum and other raw materials, further supporting commodities prices.

With the global economy projected by the International Monetary Fund to grow at its fastest pace since 2011 this year and next year, some investors think a commodities rally that began last summer will continue. As is the case with stocks, some analysts think the fundamentals for investing in raw materials outweigh possible concerns about higher interest rates.

""This is one of the strongest macro backdrops I've seen for investing,"" said Mike Mullaney, director of global market research for fund manager Boston Partners, whose firm has increased positions in energy and materials stocks. ""That lends itself to overweighting some of these commodity-based sectors.""

Unlike stocks, commodities are still relatively cheap. Oil is still off 56% from its 2008 highs, while gold and copper are off 30% and 31%, respectively, from their records set in 2011.

In recent months, stocks around the world and raw materials have traded together, and the recent bounce back for commodities has come as the S&P 500 has recovered 68% of the losses that sent it into correction territory on Feb. 8.

That makes the rally look vulnerable to investors' appetite for risk and the direction of the stock market, some analysts say.

Some analysts think that riskier investments are likely to weaken as central banks around the world unwind years of accommodative monetary policy. Higher interest rates can make commodities less attractive compared with yield-bearing assets such as Treasurys because raw materials pay their holders nothing. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note has risen to four-year highs and is approaching 3%. It closed at 2.862% Monday.

Others think an economic slowdown in China, the world's largest materials consumer, and supply factors continue to loom over the market.

John LaForge, head of real asset strategy for the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he thinks commodities have been too dependent on temporary factors -- such as protests in Iran and labor strikes at mines in Chile and Peru -- that have pinched output. Commodities prices are still way off their peaks, and even with recently rising prices, he doesn't expect that trend to reverse.

""There's still just too much supply,"" Mr. LaForge said.

Other analysts said signs that inflation is picking up should favor commodities. Many investors use raw materials to protect against a surge in consumer prices because they think commodities can hold their value better than other assets. Price increases in commodities also typically contribute to higher inflation as it becomes more expensive for companies to produce goods.

Several large companies, including Ford Motor Co. and Procter & Gamble Co., have already blamed weaker profits or darker outlooks on higher commodities prices. Although persistently low inflation has puzzled economists for years, recent U.S. employment data showed wages notching their biggest increase since 2009.

Doug Cohen, managing partner of portfolio management at Athena Capital Advisors, said the firm has increased its clients' positions in gold and Treasury-inflation protected securities.

""I actually do think this time it's real,"" he said of inflation rising.

Fresh money has been pouring back into commodities funds world-wide: Assets under management reached roughly $530 billion in January, up 13% from the previous month and their highest level in four years, Citigroup estimates show. A JPMorgan Chase analysis showed the largest January inflow of open interest into commodities over the past decade.

""The environment for investing in commodities is the best since 2004-2008,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note to clients earlier this month.",1
14-Mar-18,77.23,77.735,76.72,77.65,17288327,citigroup,"The reality of inflation and growth has shifted only a little in the past few months. Beliefs about inflation and growth, however, have moved a lot, and investors hoping they will rise fast could be in trouble if reality doesn't catch up soon.

This is most obvious in the bond market. Last summer, gloom about the prospects for inflation prevailed, with hedge funds having more bets on bond yields falling than rising. No longer. The narrative has shifted, and fast money has shifted with it, making some of the biggest bets ever on yields rising.

The risk for investors is that the move from worrying about deflation to worrying about inflation won't happen smoothly. In other words, reality might once again disappoint the market. Yes, bond yields should go up -- over time. But they have soared this year, to the point that the fall in bond prices, which go down when yields go up, is as quick as it has been only four other times since the end of the recession in 2009. Each of those times prices fell too fast and popped back up.

""Cyclically, everyone's very excited,"" said Chris Watling, founder of consulting firm Longview Economics. ""Every asset allocator you talk to seems to be short the 10-year"" Treasury.

Many of the biggest recent swings in bond yields have come when investors were crowded into wrong-way bets. In April 2010, futures traders had what was then a record bet on rising yields, reflecting a consensus that the economy was in a normal postrecession rebound. Suffice to say it wasn't, and those bets were quickly reversed. The same happened at the end of 2016, when postelection excitement about rising yields led to a record bet, but again proved wildly overdone.

The opposite happened in May 2013 and last summer, when investors had some of their biggest postcrisis bets using futures and options on bond yields falling. In both cases, 10-year yields subsequently jumped by close to a percentage point. This month the net bet on rising 10-year Treasury yields reached the second biggest, behind only the rise after the election, while the number of futures-only bets on rising yields hit a record.

This isn't to say that the new consensus is wrong. Global economic growth brings with it a tighter jobs market and more demand, which ought to be inflationary. The worry is that it doesn't arrive quickly enough to confirm investors in their new belief and disappointment sets in. Leveraged funds with large positions would then look exposed, something that often prompts them to close out their bets and would push down bond yields. With tens of billions of dollars of outstanding bets against bond futures, such a rush to cover short positions could have a big effect.

The new market story is of synchronized global growth, tighter monetary policy and higher wages and inflation. The short-term issue isn't so much whether it is right or wrong, but whether everyone yet believes in it. If there are more investors out there who haven't been converted, then economic data supporting the story could push up bond yields further still. If everyone and his dog is already betting on growth and inflation, then the very same data might disappoint those hoping for more.

In Europe, there are already signs of disappointment. Economic data have been coming in below forecasts, pushing Citigroup Inc.'s measure of ""economic surprise"" negative for the first time since September 2016. Again, this suggests not that the eurozone is in trouble, but merely that economists upgraded their forecasts too enthusiastically.

Now, I'm a natural contrarian and may again be overestimating how far the story has to run. After the U.S. election I thought it was right that bond yields should rise, but that they had gone up far too quickly given the uncertainties about Donald Trump's policies. I was too early, and 10-year Treasury yields rose another 0.3 percentage point -- a fall of almost 3% in price -- before the market began to share my concerns about how long it would take to implement tax cuts and infrastructure spending.

A repeat is possible. Fund-manager sentiment toward bonds is very negative, but not as negative as it was after the election or during the 2013 taper tantrum. Bond yields have risen fast, but not as fast as they did after the election. Bets on inflation over the next five years being above 3% -- derived from inflation options -- are still below where they stood after the election, too. All these measures could run further, and hedge funds and others could pile on even bigger bets on rising yields.

Yet, the balance of risks has shifted. Wage growth that would have been a positive surprise last summer would today be a damp squib for investors who are expecting a continuation of last month's fireworks. U.S. Treasurys may still look unattractive at a 10-year yield of just under 2.9%, but remember that it has only been above 3% for two days since July 2011. The market is adopting a new narrative, but it would be normal to have plot twists as the story works out.",0

The front-month crude-oil futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange reached $26.21 a barrel on Feb. 11, 2016. A Page One article on Feb. 27 about the 40% rule in forecasting incorrectly said that oil fell to $30.

(WSJ March 10, 2018)

What are the chances that readers will make it to the end of this article? About 40%.

If you do make it, that prediction will look smart. If you don't, well, we said the odds were against it.

Such is the nature of the 40% rule, a favorite forecasting tactic of Wall Street analysts and other prognosticators trying to make a bold call without being too bold.

Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair said last month there's a 40% chance that Brexit will be reversed; Citigroup Inc. analyst Jim Suva wrote that there's a 40% chance Apple Inc. buys Netflix Inc.; and Nomura Holdings Inc. economist Lewis Alexander said there's a 40% chance Nafta gets ripped up.

The nice thing about 40% is that you never have to say you were wrong, says Peter Tchir, a market strategist at Academy Securities. Say you predict the Dow Jones Industrial Average has a 40% chance of hitting 30000 before year-end.

""Get it right and you can say 'See, I was telling everyone it could happen,'"" he says. ""Get it wrong and you can weasel your way out: 'I didn't say it was likely, I just said it was a strong possibility.'""

With a 24-hour news cycle, outlets from cable channels to newspapers are always looking for an expert to weigh in. If they offer an audacious estimate that will get clicks, all the better. The trend has boosted the industry of analysts and talking heads who predict everything from elections to corporate earnings.

A whiff can ding a forecaster's reputation.

Nate Silver became America's most famous election forecaster when he called all 50 states correctly in the 2012 presidential election. Four years later he was criticized for repeatedly projecting that Donald Trump stood no chance in the Republican primary and for his final projection that gave Hillary Clinton a 71% chance of victory.

Mr. Silver says he deserves some criticism for his primary projections, but not his general election forecast, which he called ""highly informative and useful"" since others gave Mr. Trump a smaller chance.

To protect their reputations, pundits hedge. They may not provide a date by which a forecast will occur. They often ""cluster"" forecasts together with other analysts around a ""consensus"" figure so that everyone will probably be the same amount of wrong.

Citigroup's Mr. Suva forgot to hedge. He put a 40% chance on Apple buying Netflix, but also a 25% chance Apple buys Walt Disney Co., a 10% chance each it buys one of three videogame makers, and a 5% chance it buys Tesla Inc. That sums to 100%, implying it is mathematically certain Apple buys one of them.

A Citigroup spokeswoman said Mr. Suva doesn't believe a deal for one of those companies is guaranteed. She said the forecast was really a conditional probability, contingent on Apple using its huge cash pile for what she called a ""mega deal,"" which she said Mr. Suva actually views as less likely than a large stock buyback. The conditional probability wasn't specified in Mr. Suva's research note.

""Pundits and gurus master the art of going out on a limb without going out on limb,"" says Philip Tetlock, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has made a career analyzing which people forecast well, and why. One of his pet peeves is how gurus use vague terms like ""distinct possibility"" instead of percentage odds when they describe probabilities. That makes it easy to wiggle out of, or take credit for a forecast, since it isn't clear at all what a distinct possibility is.

But one drawback of percentage odds, Mr. Tetlock says, is that people are often unclear on what they actually mean.

Mr. Silver can relate. Some of his harshest critics took his 71% projection of a Clinton victory as a sure thing that she would win, he says. ""You wouldn't cross the street if there was a 30% chance you'd get hit.""

Courageous contrarian calls are the best way forecasters capture the public's attention, and get television time. New York University Professor Nouriel Roubini was dubbed ""Dr. Doom"" for correctly predicting the financial crisis. Then in 2010 he projected a 40% chance of a ""double-dip recession"" in the U.S. It didn't happen.

Mr. Roubini says he doesn't remember the projection, but that he takes pride in sticking his neck out, as with his latest call that Bitcoin is the biggest bubble in history and will go to zero.

""I would not rule out that I've committed the sin of the 40% rule,"" said Prof. Roubini. ""Everybody has done so.""

""There's an aspect of infotainment"" that Wall Street forecasters always keep in mind, says John Kilduff, portfolio manager at commodities hedge fund Again Capital. In September 2015 Mr. Kilduff told CNBC viewers that crude oil had a 40% shot at falling to $20 per barrel. Then at $45, oil followed its downward trend before bottoming at $30.

""You're always riding the hero-shithead roller coaster,"" says Mr. Kilduff, ""we all have plenty of haters, and they're even more visible now with Twitter."" He noted one correspondent who took a forecast personally. ""Hope you lose EVERYTHING [on] your short,"" the person wrote in a salty email reviewed by the Journal. The correspondent also called Mr. Kilduff ugly.

""The old 40% trick!"" recalled Stephen Roach, formerly Morgan Stanley's chief economist. ""A warning of a looming forecast change, a rising risk assessment, a way to cover your rear -- or a combination of all three."" Mr. Roach said that by stamping a 40% probability on a possible outlier he could call clients' attention to shifting winds without changing his underlying forecast.

A nonrigorous examination of Mr. Roach's past forecasts showed he put a 40% chance on two recession predictions in 2002 and 2004, and then another recession projection in 2010. All of those he got wrong, or rather, got right, since he said the odds were against.

The 40% rule can be useful for all manner of punditry. British boxer Anthony Joshua speculated in 2015 that underdog Tyson Fury had a 40% shot to beat heavily favored champ Wladimir Klitschko. Mr. Fury won, and now wants to fight Mr. Joshua. A spokesman for Mr. Joshua didn't respond when asked what chance the boxer would give himself against Mr. Fury.

The picture is still one of strong growth, but investors may still need to consider the subtle shift in what has been a remarkable comeback story for markets.

Three surveys on conditions in February all proved weaker than the consensus forecast this week. First, the European Commission's flash consumer confidence indicator for the eurozone fell to 0.1, down 1.3 points from January.

Then, the IHS Markit flash composite eurozone purchasing managers index declined to 57.5 from 58.8. Finally, the German Ifo Business Climate Index dropped to 115.4 from 117.6.

Of course, investors shouldn't read too much into one week's data. And in each case, the readings are still close to multiyear highs. The Ifo index in January matched its highest level ever on data going back to 1991. Meanwhile, the purchasing managers index is pointing to a first-quarter growth rate of 0.9% from a quarter earlier, IHS Markit says, particularly strong for the eurozone. In 2017, the currency bloc enjoyed its strongest year of growth for a decade, expanding 2.5%.

But for markets, there could be change afoot as the reassurance of data consistently beating expectations fades.

The Citigroup economic surprise index for the eurozone, which tracks whether economic data is beating or missing expectations, has fallen below zero this week for the first time since September 2016, after its longest streak in positive territory since at least 2003. If expectations have finally caught up with reality, then there is a greater chance of disappointment for the first time in a while.

Ultimately, the level of growth in the eurozone looks encouraging. But the acceleration that marked 2017 may have topped out for now.",1

The bank on Friday said that it plans to issue about $335 million in refunds to affected customers, or about $190 on average per affected account.

Citigroup said the issue stemmed from the bank increasing annual percentage rates on cards after customers missed payments as well as other reasons. The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act requires card issuers who increase rates to review those accounts every six months.

Issuers are then supposed to reduce the rate if the reason for the increase is no longer a problem. That could include, for example, a cardholder establishing a pattern of again paying the bill on time.

Citigroup said the issue affected roughly 1.75 million U.S. credit-card accounts over a period ranging from 2011 to 2017.

Some of those accounts received smaller rate reductions than they should have, while others didn't receive any reduction, the bank said. They included the bank's regular credit cards, co-branded cards that it has with merchants, and credit cards that can be used only at specific stores.

The bank said it delivered about 90% of the savings to customers as required by the interest-rate reduction requirement, resulting in more than $3 billion in savings.

The bank has about 120 million U.S. credit-card accounts and had a total of about 250 million U.S. credit-card accounts during the period in which the problems occurred. Citigroup is the third-largest U.S. credit-card issuer by total volume and by outstanding balances, according to the Nilson Report.

The bank, which disclosed the issue in its annual securities filing made Friday, saida periodic internal review identifiedthe flaws in its methodology. Citigroup reported the issue to its regulators, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

""While we believed our methodology was sound, a periodic internal review identified potential flaws in the methodology,"" a bank spokeswoman said. ""We informed our regulators, revised our methodology going forward and conducted a comprehensive review of our process."" She added that the bank found no evidence of employee misconduct, but that it ""should have identified these issues sooner.""

Citigroup hasn't finalized the list of consumers affected and said they include current and former cardholders.

The bank's credit-card division generated more than $100 billion in revenue from 2011 to 2017. The bank stands out from many of its competitors by offering long promotional zero percent interest rates on its cards to entice consumers to sign up.

It also sends out many balance-transfer offers with zero-percent promotional rates to entice existing customers to transfer credit-card balances they have with other issuers.",1

LITIGATION

FDIC Sues 16 Banks

In Libor Rigging Case

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. sued 16 banks connected to the Libor rigging scandal as part of its effort to recover funds related to Doral Bank, a Puerto Rican institution that collapsed in 2015.

In its lawsuit, the FDIC argued the banks' collusion on fixing the London interbank offered rate -- a benchmark rate used to set the prices of trillions of dollars in loans and derivatives -- had hampered Doral's competitiveness by, among other things, breaching swap contracts with the failed bank.

""Doral and the [FDIC]'s injuries arose from the harm to competition"" as a result of Libor fixing by the large banks, the complaint said. ""These injuries flow directly from the substitution of collusion for competition in the market for [over-the-counter] interest-rate derivatives.""

The FDIC's move follows an ongoing lawsuit filed by the FDIC in 2014 against the same large financial institutions accused of participating in a Libor manipulating scheme, including Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The earlier lawsuit alleged Libor manipulations had harmed 38 banks the FDIC had placed in receivership after they collapsed.

Doral Bank was closed by Puerto Rico regulators in February 2015, in the largest U.S. bank failure since 2010.

The bank, which shut down with $5.9 billion in assets, was sold to Banco Popular de Puerto Rico.",1
7-Mar-18,77.18,77.46,76.4,77.08,11066364,citigroup,"Some well-funded startups have an unusual pitch for homeowners strapped for cash: Let's own this house together.

A handful of companies, including those backed by marquee Silicon Valley names such as Andreessen Horowitz and Mark Zuckerberg's philanthropic organization, are experimenting with a product that essentially lets them take an ownership position in a house along with the homeowner. The agreements, called ""shared-equity"" contracts, provide a new way for investors to get exposure to rising home prices across the U.S.

Shared-equity products are aimed at new buyers who need help with a down payment, or current homeowners looking for an alternative to a cash-out mortgage refinancing or a home-equity loan. The first use has caught the attention of mortgage-finance giant Freddie Mac, which recently agreed to buy loans on properties where one firm, Unison Agreement Corp., contributes to the down payment.

In those cases, home buyers get money for part of their down payment in exchange for pledging some of the home's future price appreciation. The firms market them as a better alternative to low-down-payment loans, since they can give consumers more buying power without requiring them to take out pricey mortgage insurance.

Landed Inc. offers these down-payment contracts to teachers and other educators. Last year, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a philanthropy co-founded by Facebook Inc.'s chief executive, gave Landed $5 million to start a new fund.

Michael Nizhnikov found out about Unison's shared-equity product from his mortgage lender, Guaranteed Rate Inc. He used it for half of the 20% down payment on a home when he moved to accept a position in the psychology department at Southern Connecticut State University.

Dr. Nizhnikov, 46 years old, said the idea of sharing ownership of his home at first was a bit disconcerting. One thing that won him over: If his home's value falls, Unison shares in the loss. ""We get to feel comfortable, just in case something crazy happens,"" Dr. Nizhnikov said.

The length of the contracts can vary from a few years to 30. Homeowners can repay early, including if they sell their house before the term ends. How much they end up owing depends on how the value of their home changes. Because the funds are equity, not a borrowing, they don't require monthly payments.

For example, a Unison customer could receive $50,000 toward a $100,000 down payment on a $500,000 house. If the home later sells for $600,000, the customer gets back the $50,000 he or she initially put down plus 65% of the $100,000 appreciation. Unison gets back its $50,000 plus the other $35,000 of appreciated value. (That is keeping the mortgage constant at $400,000 for illustrative purposes.)

And if the home goes down in value? Unison shares in the loss. Say the home sells for $400,000. After paying back the $400,000 mortgage, the homeowner's $50,000 in equity is wiped out. Unison only shares in 35% of the loss. That means the homeowner is on the hook for the difference and needs to pay Unison $15,000.

Shared-equity contracts can help home buyers unload some risk of a decline in property values, but they also can end up being expensive if housing prices rise. ""The homeowners who are going to do this are the ones who don't have a lot of choices,"" said Allan Weiss, who founded a home-price analytics firm that bears his name.

Patch Homes Inc., Point Digital Finance Inc. and Unison are among the companies that are marketing these products as an alternative to home-equity loans and cash-out refinancings. Unlike those products, shared-equity contracts don't add to the consumer's outstanding debt and tend to have looser qualification standards.

Raju Mann of Marin County, Calif., took out about $85,000 through a shared-equity contract on her home from Point in 2016. She was encouraged by the startup's shareholders, which include Andreessen Horowitz and former Citigroup Inc. CEO Vikram Pandit.

Ms. Mann, 54, said banks rejected her for loans because her sources of income -- including royalties on the sale of books written by her grandfather, Nobel Prize-winning author Thomas Mann -- were unpredictable.

After getting funds from Point, Ms. Mann used the money to pay off debt. Home prices were rising in her neighborhood, though, and the longer she waited to pay back Point, the more the firm would make. She decided to exit her contract last month, using money she got refinancing her existing mortgage. Ultimately, she wound up paying Point around $120,000. ""They made good money with me,"" Ms. Mann said.

Unison said it has done 600 agreements in the past year; the other firms have done fewer. To the firms, the idea is to give homeowners the same option that companies have in raising funds via both debt and equity. The firms also typically charge fees for arranging the contracts.

For investors, yields can be attractive. Kingsbridge Wealth Management Inc., a Las Vegas-based multifamily office, has placed around $3 million into a fund that Point manages since May 2016, earning an internal rate of return of roughly 16%, said Kingsbridge President David J. Dunn.

But there also is risk that investors' capital will be tied up for years before recognizing any gains.

High-school biology teacher Sara Shayesteh and her husband, Isaac, used an agreement with Landed to cover about half their down payment for their home in San Mateo, Calif.

The Shayestehs have 10 years to repay Landed, but can choose to do so after one year. They said it feels odd to have an investor own part of their house but are grateful for the arrangement. ""We're trying to live in a crazy area with a market,"" said Ms. Shayesteh, 32. ""There's no other way we could have purchased a property that would have met our needs.""",1

27-Feb-18,74.34,75.375,74.15,75.18,11749123,citigroup,"Wall Street CEOs are getting paid the big bucks again.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. said Friday that they gave their CEOs raises for 2017, meaning all five large U.S. banks with significant trading and investment-banking operations have done so.

The chief executives of the banks, which include JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley, were paid on average $25.3 million for their work last year, up 17% from 2016, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

For the group as a whole, combined total compensation of about $126 million is the highest annual tally since before the financial crisis.

The gains mark the fifth consecutive year in which pay rose for Wall Street's top CEOs. In 2017, the increases reflected stronger profits for banks driven by an expanding economy, rising employment, loosening regulations under President Donald Trump and an improving interest-rate backdrop for lending.

Citigroup was the latest to report that it was increasing the boss's compensation. CEO Michael Corbat was paid $23 million for his work in 2017, up 48% from his $15.5 million payday in 2016.

Goldman Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein was awarded a $24 million pay package, up 9% from the prior year.

Most of the annual compensation announced over the past month at the nation's largest banks comes in the form of incentive bonuses, often stock-based and not cashed until later. And all the pay packages still pale in comparison to Mr. Blankfein's $68.5 million award for 2007 when trading profits and risk-taking drove results for Goldman and its peers.

Still, this bonus season for Wall Street CEOs is in many ways the best in more than a decade. All five CEOs were awarded at least $20 million, something that hasn't happened since 2006, according to a Wall Street Journal review of banks' proxy statements. Mr. Corbat, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan and Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman each enjoyed their best annual pay packages as chief executive.

Mr. Blankfein received a cash salary of $2 million -- steady from 2016, when he got a pay cut -- plus a cash bonus of $4.4 million and the remainder in stock units whose value will depend on how Goldman does over the next few years, accordingto a regulatory filing Friday.

That puts him in the middle of the pack among Wall Street chiefs. JPMorgan Chase's James Dimon got a 5% raise to $29.5 million. Mr. Gorman followed at $27 million after a 20% pay raise. Wells Fargo & Co., which doesn't have a large Wall Street presence, hasn't yet disclosed its CEO's compensation.

Goldman's revenue in 2017 rose 5%. Setting aside the impact of a hit from the recently passed tax-overhaul law, its return on equity was 10.8%, one of only two banks to crack double digits.

Yet its core business of fixed-income trading had its worst year since the financial crisis. The firm bet wrong on things including interest rates, the U.S. dollar and natural gas. Mr. Blankfein once ran that business and remains closely associated with its performance.

The biggest jump in pay came for Mr. Corbat, the lone Wall Street CEO of the five who isn't also the bank's chairman. Citigroup posted a loss of $6.2 billion for 2017, though that was because of a charge the bank took to prepare for the new tax law. The board said it had considered Citigroup's underlying results, as well as the bank's increased shareholder dividends and its passing grade on the Federal Reserve's stress test.

It has been a long road for Mr. Corbat to crack the $20 million pay mark. For his first full year as CEO, 2013, he was awarded $14.5 million. The following three years, his pay wavered between $13 million and $16.5 million, as Citigroup struggled to increase profitability and break out of past regulatory problems.

For his work in 2017, Mr. Corbat is getting a cash bonus of $6.45 million, to go along with his $1.5 million salary. The rest of the package comprises stock that is dependent on the bank's performance. This is also deferred, meaning it will be paid out over coming years. That structure is meant to tie Mr. Corbat's compensation to the bank's longer-term performance.

Last year, Citigroup's board cut his pay because of ""the firm's performance relative to its financial targets."" This year, the board said Mr. Corbat had demonstrated ""exceptional leadership in multiple critical areas,"" including risk management and talent management. It also said it considered the pay of CEOs at peer institutions.",1
27-Feb-18,74.47,75.5,73.97,74.76,16677666,citigroup,"Throughout last year, investors worried about a phantom menace that could upset markets: higher U.S. inflation. They were wrong, to their own pleasant surprise. Now they could be right, which creates its own complications.

The key thing to consider is the power of expectations -- perhaps the most important force in financial markets. For some, higher inflation has been a worry ever since global central banks engaged in extraordinary monetary policy. But consumer-price inflation has been puzzlingly absent: Last year, former Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen labeled the behavior of U.S. inflation a ""mystery.""

The fuss now might seem odd given headline inflation has been rising since its nadir in 2015. But crucially, it didn't rise as much as expected last year, and a lot of the move was down to a rebound in energy prices. Economists, who help shape market expectations, persistently forecast higher U.S. inflation than what emerged. That can be seen in Citigroup's U.S. inflation surprise index, which has been in negative territory even as its eurozone and Japanese peers have picked up.

The lack of inflationary worries meant stronger global growth captured investors' attention last year. Equity markets posted big gains, while fixed-income investors were remarkably relaxed about U.S. monetary policy, keeping long-term bond yields contained. Combined with better growth, particularly in Europe, the dollar weakened throughout 2017. That helped support risk appetite in emerging markets, brightening the economic outlook further.

But the backdrop has changed. The recent violent market swings started with an apparent pickup in U.S. wage growth. Added to that are concerns about U.S. tax and spending policy, piled on top of already loose monetary policy. U.S. bond yields haven't fallen even as markets have grown turbulent.

January inflation data out Wednesday is therefore key. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expect headline inflation at 1.9% and core inflation, excluding food and energy, at 1.7%. If the numbers start overshooting expectations, markets could get another jolt. So many got inflation wrong for so long, that getting it right is its own form of surprise.",1

A dozen banks -- including Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley -- have agreed to provide up to $100 billion of committed credit facilities, including a $5 billion revolver and bridge financing, according to people familiar with the matter.

Private-equity firms KKR & Co. and CVC Capital Partners agreed to join Silver Lake in providing $6 billion in convertible debt for the deal and postclosing working-capital needs, the people said.

Broadcom has been in pursuit of Qualcomm since November and has nominated a slate of directors that would be voted on at a meeting in early March. Broadcom a week ago raised its bid to $82 a share in cash and stock, or more than $120 billion.

The commitments would enable Broadcom to fully fund the $60 a share cash portion of the bid.

Locking down funding for the deal would remove a major question mark over Broadcom's bid for Qualcomm, which, if successful, would be the biggest technology takeover ever.

The Wall Street firm is in talks to offer financing to shoppers buying phones, watches and other gadgets from Apple, people familiar with the matter said. Customers purchasing a $1,000 iPhone X could take out a loan from Goldman instead of charging it to credit cards that often carry high interest rates.

Talks between the tech company and the investment bank are continuing and could still fall apart. A spokesman for Goldman declined to comment. Apple didn't respond to requests for comment.

The partnership would be a coup for Goldman as it tries to expand its new consumer bank. Better known as an elite adviser to corporations and governments, Goldman is embracing retail banking and plain-vanilla lending in pursuit of growth as some traditional areas of strength, namely trading, slump.

In 2016, Goldman launched Marcus, an online lending division that helps people refinance credit-card debt. Goldman is now building a ""point-of-sale"" financing business that will offer loans to shoppers at checkout, according to people familiar with the firm, effectively finding those customers one step earlier.

Shoppers in 2017 borrowed more than $200 billion for purchases using credit cards affiliated with retailers or point-of-sale loans, consulting firm First Annapolis estimates. Some $80 billion went toward big-ticket items like furniture and electronics that can take months to pay off, racking up extra interest as borrowers roll over balances from month to month.

By offering a lower-cost loan, Goldman hopes to siphon off some of that business. Goldman charges 12% interest on its average Marcus loans. Credit cards can charge upward of 20% and carry late fees and other charges.

Partnerships with big retailers like Apple are key. They can deliver millions of customers that Goldman would struggle to find on its own.

The bank in October hired Scott Young from Citigroup Inc., where he ran retail credit-card partnerships and helped snag the Costco Wholesale Corp. relationship away from American Express Co. He is responsible for striking similar deals for Goldman, which aims to finance purchases ranging from vacations to home furnishings to orthodontics. The bank will start by offering loans similar to its existing Marcus product, but is exploring adding traditional store-brand credit cards down the road, thepeople familiar with the matter said.

Apple introduced a program in 2015 with Citizens Financial Group Inc., in which the regional bank offered zero-interest loans for iPhone upgrades and higher-interest options for other device purchases. Part of Goldman's talks with Apple involves taking over some form of the upgrade program. It is unclear whether anything will change with the handling of the outstanding Citizens loans. The Providence, R.I.-based bank didn't have an immediate comment.

The program started as wireless providers were scaling back subsidies for iPhones. It allows customers to pay for a new iPhone with a 24-month financing plan and upgrade to a new device after making 12 payments, a strategy that helps keep customers coming back for the newest models.

For Apple, the upgrade program is taking on increasing importance as its high-priced devices create sticker shock for some.",1

Investors borrow to boost bets on stocks, using margin loans. But when prices fall, investors have to either stump up more cash to repay some of the debt or sell shares.

When things move too quickly, it is the banks and brokers that made the loans who take a bath.

Borrowing is very high in current markets, although by one measure it isn't as aggressive as it has been. Banks, however, have more reason to worry than in recent times: Many of them were hit with a sudden and very painful loss in this business late last year.

That means they could limit new margin lending or start cutting back on what they already have given to clients. That would remove one leg of support that has helped buoy stock markets.

Net borrowing by U.S. investors in securities margin accounts is at record levels, according to data from Haver Analytics.

Debt balances of nearly $290 billion at the end of November 2017 were more than double the levels of early 2000 ahead of the dot-com crash.

However, stock prices have risen significantly, too, which means all that debt is backed by more valuable collateral. The total value of stock loans as a share of the market capitalization of all U.S. stocks is elevated but lower than during the financial crisis. In the past few years it has held rela-tively steady, suggesting debt was rising only in line with the market.

Even though margin lending is deemed low risk by regulators -- because the shares that back the loans should be easy to sell in an orderly downturn -- banks have a big reason to cut their exposure.

Last year, a scandal around the South African retail group Steinhoff International Holdings landed many with huge losses on a single stock-backed loan to the group's former chairman.

For the banks involved that have reported 2017 results -- Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs Group, JPMorgan Chase, UBS Group and BNP Paribas -- the losses they suffered were equivalent to seeing fourth-quarter revenue from equities trading cut between almost 10% and 20%.

That is hard to take, but what is worse is getting caught out again by a bigger market selloff. As investors adjust to where markets might go next, they are likely to be getting calls from brokers to say they won't have as much credit to play with as they have been recently enjoying. And that is probably no bad thing.",1

Shares tumbled 9.2% on Monday amid a broader selloff in stock prices, as analysts ratcheted down earnings estimates for the third-largest U.S. bank by assets. The decline, its sharpest one-day drop since April 2009, was especially painful because the recently bright outlook for banks was also thrown into question Monday.

The acute market declines shifted, at least for now, bank investors' optimism about stronger economic growth, rising interest rates and lighter regulation. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index dropped 4.9%, slightly more than the 4.6% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Still, Wells Fargo has been hit the hardest. Since the start of the year, Wells Fargo's shares have lost 4.2%, while its biggest peers have gained between 2% and 3%.

Meanwhile, the bank's price/earnings ratio has fallen below that of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp.

The challenge now facing Wells Fargo was on display Friday night in an analyst call held less than two hours after the Fed announced an unprecedented enforcement action and said the bank would replace four board directors by year-end.

Chief Executive Officer Timothy Sloan said five times on the call that the bank is ""open for business.""

Wells Fargo in its presentation to analysts Friday night said that it expected the Fed action to reduce 2018 after-tax profit by between $300 million and $400 million.

Such a reduction comes at an inopportune time for Wells Fargo. Over the past three quarters, the bank's net interest income -- a gauge of lending profitability -- has fallen. At the same time, the bank has been in the midst of an effort to cut $4 billion in annual costs by 2019.

In the wake of the Fed's growth cap, half a dozen analysts on Monday cut estimates for 2018 earnings per share to an average of $4.71 from a previous average of $4.83. Some of those analysts trimmed forecasts for 2019 earnings to an average of $5.16, down from an average of $5.40.

KBW bank analyst Brian Kleinhanzl downgraded Wells Fargo to ""market perform"" from ""outperform"" and lowered his earnings-per-share estimates to $4.70 from $4.90 for 2018 and to $5.10 from $5.45 for 2019.

""The bottom line is that the [Fed] order will mean Wells will have a harder time maintaining market share and will have to compete more on price or credit terms versus peers,"" he wrote.

Gerard Cassidy, an RBC Capital bank analyst, also voiced concerns about competition, writing that ""existing customers could be pried away from the company by aggressive competitors."" He added that given a positive outlook for the banking industry, investors would be better off owning JPMorgan, Bank of America or Citigroup Inc., which ""will be able to harness the growth of the U.S. economy.""

Wells Fargo executives said Friday that they would use a series of financial maneuvers to limit certain activities so the bank won't have to deny business to its large consumer base. But certain commercial customers could get squeezed.

For instance, the bank may reduce certain commercial deposits known as ""nonoperational,"" of which it had roughly $200 billion as of the end of 2017. That is a tactic JPMorgan used to lower its asset size a few years ago.

Wells Fargo may also limit financial institutions' deposits, which tallied $149 billion at year-end 2017. And it could also reduce its $92 billion in trading assets and $91 billion in short-term investments as of Dec. 31, 2017.

Some analysts were more sanguine. Sanford C. Bernstein's John McDonald wrote Monday that the growth cap will be manageable because Wells Fargo ""was already planning to continue shrinking. . .auto and home-equity loans."" He estimates the two noncore portfolios will decline by about $15 billion this year, ""creating additional flexibility"" for the bank.

Overall, Mr. McDonald said he expects the impact of the Fed moves to go away by next year. He added the growth cap hadn't significantly altered his view of the bank, but he had been modeling just 1% loan growth in 2018.

Some investors were taken aback by the Fed's action and the fact the bank hasn't fully overcome the sales-practices scandal. Still, others were holding on.

Shareholder David Katz said the Fed's action is ""sending another message to Wells that they've got to be more aggressive in getting their act together."" But he said he was confident in the bank's approach to how it can ""meet all the needs"" of clients and manage the balance sheet.

Mr. Katz, who is president and chief investment officer at New York-based Matrix Asset Advisors Inc. that owns about 480,000 Wells Fargo shares, said the firm plans to hold its current position.",1
14-Mar-18,75.52,77.225,72.2,73.27,31087807,citigroup,"Banks are closing branches at the fastest pace in decades, as they leave less profitable regions and fewer customers use tellers for routine transactions.

The number of branches in the U.S. shrank by more than 1,700 in the 12-month period ended in June 2017, the biggest decline on record, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of federal data.

Branch numbers fell again in the second half of 2017, according to related data submitted to bank regulators and reviewed by the Journal. That would add to the thousands of locations closed following the financial crisis and is the longest stretch of closures since the Great Depression.

Many of the closings were in big cities and surrounding suburbs, where branches were consolidated largely because of falling foot traffic. Others were in rural areas, where some large regional lenders are leaving town altogether.

While banks battered during the financial crisis such as Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. started cutting branches years ago, regional banks have only accelerated closures more recently. From mid-2012 to mid-2017, Capital One Financial Corp. cut 32% of its branches, SunTrust Banks Inc. 22% and Regions Financial Corp. 12%. For all three, the sharpest cuts came in the most recent 12-month period.

Banks say they carefully consider which branches to close, examining deposit levels at each branch and commute time to the nearest location. ""We continue to evolve and optimize our branch network to ensure that we're operating as efficiently and effectively as possible,"" a Capital One spokeswoman said.

For decades, banks needed to add new locations to expand, pushing the number of U.S. branches to a peak in 2009. But in the aftermath of the financial crisis, some started closing branches to save money and then kept closing them to contend with low interest rates and higher regulatory costs.

Along the way, lenders realized they could maintain their deposit levels with fewer locations in a digital world in which customers often prefer banks' mobile apps and ATMs.

The shift in strategy is helping some banks reach profit records.

For instance, Bank of America's adjusted earnings in 2017 matched its highest annual profit ever. The bank closed or sold more than 1,500 branches since 2009, including the vast majority of its rural branches. The closures have helped the bank save on occupancy and employee costs, bringing down overall expenses. The lower expense levels have bolstered bank profit.

Real-estate auction firm Ten-X says more banks are using its site to sell properties, many at a discount. The firm, which got its start focusing on distressed real estate, is now considering a new group dedicated to branches.

For example, Wells Fargo & Co., which preserved its branch network even as rivals trimmed, has started cutting it back since its sales-practice scandal imploded in 2016.

Regional banks Fifth Third Bancorp in Cincinnati and Regions, based in Birmingham, Ala., disclosed in regulatory filings that they have been selling land that they had once bought for future branch locations.

Banks are still opening new branches, just not enough to make up for the ones they are closing. Bank of America, for instance, has expanded into big cities where it previously didn't have branches. JPMorgan Chase & Co. similarly announced plans to open as many as 400 branches in new markets in coming years.

Some closures involve banks leaving rural areas because branches there aren't profitable enough, according to the Journal analysis. Since mid-2012, PNC Financial Services Group Inc. has cut its branches in rural areas and small towns by nearly one-third. SunTrust has cut its rural branches almost by half.

When PNC closed its only branch in Jeromesville, Ohio, in 2015, the bank told regulators in a letter that it was ""due to limited usage in a declining rural area."" In a letter to customers, PNC wrote that consumers were ""using branches very differently today"" and that they have ""more service choices than ever."" While Jeromesville has no remaining bank branches, it does still have a PNC ATM.

""Limited usage is one of many criteria we look at when making the difficult but necessary decision to close a branch,"" PNC said. ""Other criteria include community needs and the closest nearby branch."" PNC has a branch roughly 8 miles from Jeromesville.

Some customers miss their branches. Bubba McKey, who runs a grocery store in Centreville, Miss., population 1,667, banked at the only Regions branch there for years until Regions closed it in 2016. He has since switched most of his banking to the only other bank in town, a community lender called United Mississippi Bank, but he can no longer walk just a few blocks to get change for his store or deposit checks. ""I have no qualms with the other bank,"" Mr. McKey said. ""It's mostly just the fact that you don't have a choice now.""

Charlene LeBlanc decided to keep banking at Regions, but she has to drive more than 30 miles to a Louisiana branch to cash checks. She has used Regions' mobile app to deposit checks, but says she doesn't like it. The old Regions branch still sits vacant.

""We understand that closing branches can create difficulties for our customers in smaller communities,"" a Regions spokeswoman said, adding that the bank tries to limit the impact of closings. For example, it has donated branch buildings to a credit union with locations throughout Mississippi.

When SunTrust pulled out of Muscle Shoals, Ala., last year it left a different mark: its furniture, which it bundled onto the side of the road. Employees at a business down the street, Alabama Hose Products, got new filing cabinets. A SunTrust spokeswoman declined to comment about the branch strategy but said that when the bank closes a branch, excess furniture is typically disposed of at the end of the day.",1

Three of the largest U.S. banks said Friday that they would no longer permit credit-card customers to buy bitcoin with their credit cards.

EARNINGS FORECAST: Alibaba is expected to report a net income of 13.7 billion yuan ($2.0 billion) for its fiscal third quarter, up from the 12.5 billion yuan it earned a year earlier, according to estimates from 16 analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
REVENUE FORECAST: Alibaba's quarterly revenue is likely to have risen 46% from a year earlier to 50.4 billion yuan from 34.5 billion yuan a year earlier, based on an S&P survey of 29 analysts. This would be a record quarterly revenue for Alibaba, which runs China's most popular online shopping websites, Taobao and Tmall.
WHAT TO WATCH:
--SEC PROBE AND COUNTERFEITS: Look for an update on the Securities and Exchange Commission's investigation into Alibaba's accounting practices . Alibaba has drawn the SEC's attention in the past over alleged sales of fake goods on its Chinese website, and analysts have raised concerns about its use of financial measures that don't comply with generally accepted accounting principles and because it doesn't consolidate results of some affiliates.
The company may also discuss measures it plans to take after the company was put back in December on the U.S. Trade Representative's list of global marketplaces known for counterfeit and pirated goods .
ALIBABA CLOUD: Alibaba's cloud computing arm provides data management and related services to businesses in China and overseas. Alicloud is the country's largest provider of cloud services with as much as 40% market share. AliCloud's customers include vendors on its online and mobile e-commerce ecosystem, and Alibaba says the unit has more than 651,000 paying customers. The group is expanding, opening four new data centers overseas in Germany, Dubai, Australia and Japan. Nomura Securities, HSBC Global Research, and Credit Suisse all expect revenue from Alibaba's cloud business to more than double in the third quarter, following similar growth the quarter before. Morgan Stanley expects AliCloud sales to reach $1 billion in its fiscal year 2017.
China's cloud market is still in its infancy, and market leader Alibaba has a golden opportunity here, analysts from

Nomura wrote in a recent note. Still, its leadership position could be challenged by other cloud-providers such as Tencent Holdings and Baidu Inc.
STRONG CHINA RETAIL: Online retail growth continues to outstrip overall retail growth in China, the latest government statistics show. Online retail sales of goods and services increased 26% from a year ago to 5.16 trillion yuan in 2016, compared with 10% growth in overall retail sales. Alibaba is poised to ride that wave.
The company is also set to get a boost from its Nov. 11 Singles Day sale. This year, Alibaba said merchants sold a record 120.7 billion yuan of goods on its platforms that day, 32% more than in 2015.
With e-commerce sales expanding at a slower pace, especially in big cities, Alibaba and other internet retailers are turning to new consumption segments for growth. Alibaba, JD.com's Yihaodian, and smaller startups such as Shanghai-based Freshfresh are investing in building their fresh food and grocery segments. To win in this arena, retailers must be able to offer specialty items including imports, premium brands or strong in-house labels, and have a good supply chain for fresh produce, according to Vincent Lui, a Shanghai-based partner at BCG.
DIGITAL MEDIA REVIVAL: Alibaba established its digital media and entertainment unit in June 2016, and has appointed Yu Yongfu as the unit's chief executive. In an internal email last month, Mr. Yu pledged to invest more than 50 billion yuan over the next three years in expanding operations. In a report, HSBC analyst Chi Tsang described 2016 as a year of ""rebirth and integration"" for Alibaba's entertainment affiliate, and expects the recent structural changes to allow Alibaba to refocus on producing quality content and gaining market share. E-COMMERCE AND PHYSICAL STORE INTEGRATION: Investors are also watching closely for updates on Alibaba Executive Chairman Jack Ma's strategy to deepen links between the retailer's online operations, brick-and-mortar stores and logistics. Alibaba said earlier this month it would team up with the founder of China's Intime Retail (Group) Co. to take the Hong Kong-listed department-store operator private. Alibaba and Intime's founder, Shen Guojun, will pay as much as 19.8 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$2.55 billion). Alibaba, which already has a 28% stake in Intime from a 2014 investment, would see its shareholding would rise to about 74% after the deal.

IPO Could Raise
$2 Billion or More
Guotai Junan Securities Co., China's third-largest brokerage firm by assets, has filed for a Hong Kong initial public offering that people familiar with the situation say could raise $2 billion or more by midyear.
The Shanghai-based firm filed for its IPO with the Hong Kong stock exchange on Friday. A spokeswoman for Guotai Junan didn't respond to a request to comment.
Chinese brokerages have been tapping the offshore market to fund expansion plans. Citigroup Inc.'s China securities joint-venture partner, Orient Securities Co., China Merchants Securities Co. and Everbright Securities Co., all launched multibillion-dollar offerings in Hong Kong last year. All three companies are trading marginally below their listing prices.
Guotai Junan, which listed in Shanghai in 2015, plans to use proceeds from the IPO to develop its prime brokerage, personal-financial services and investment-management businesses, as well as for overseas expansion and the growth of other divisions within the firm, according to the filing.

PBOC's Yi Defends Efforts to Stabilize Yuan Rate: State Media
The Chinese central bank's efforts to steady the yuan's exchange rate by digging into its foreign-exchange reserves will be more beneficial than harmful, says People's Bank of China Vice Gov. Yi Gang in an essay published in state media. ""Foreign reserves are meant to be utilized,"" Mr. Yi says. The central bank used about $1 trillion from its foreign-exchange reserves over the past two years to prevent the yuan from falling sharply, the official says. The timing to tap into the reserves was right, successfully stabilizing the yuan rate, he says. The world's largest stockpile of foreign currency fell $41.08 billion in December to $3.011 trillion, the lowest level since March 2011. Liyan Qi
China Signals Monetary Policy Is Still Slight Tightening
A move by China's central bank to raise interest rates on a type of special loan to certain financial institutions is more a signal than anything else. Late Tuesday, the People's Bank of China said it raised the borrowing cost on loans to 22 financial institutions via the medium-term lending facility, a new liquidity tool in place since 2014. The move was a surprise and came as the bank has been flooding the financial system with cash ahead of the Lunar New Year, when Chinese consumers go on shopping sprees and hand out red packets of cash. But Tuesday's rate increase was in line with policy makers' message that 2017 will be about containing asset bubbles and maintaining financial stability, with a slight bias toward monetary tightening. ""Yesterday was to show that the PBOC still wants to tighten,"" says Chen Long, a Beijing-based banking analyst at consultancy Gavekal. ""It doesn't want the market to interpret too much on the liquidity injection"" around the holidays.

Bundesbank Pressure to End ECB QE Could Hurt Eurozone Economy
HSBC says Deutsche Bundesbank pressure on the European Central Bank to end its QE program could lead to an early taper. It warns this could be detrimental to the eurozone economy if the ECB tightens policy due to rising inflation, which has been fueled by higher commodity prices, repeating the mistake of 2011. Back then, rising commodity prices led to a cosmetic pickup in headline inflation not corresponding to a pickup in economic activity. On the other hand, an early taper wouldn't be damaging if it is done because a genuine rise in economic activity is pushing up prices.

13-Mar-18,49.61,49.66,49.375,49.44,1257844,HSBC,"Chinese government bond yields are approaching their highest level since September 2015, after authorities overnight tightened a key rate on loans to financial institutions.
The yield on China's benchmark 10-year government bond climbed to 3.336% on Wednesday compared with 3.296% late Tuesday, approaching a recent peak in mid-December when yields hit 3.383%.
Late Tuesday, China raised rates on an important tool that the central bank uses to manage liquidity, called the medium-term lending facility. Some analysts are interpreting the move as an effective interest-rate increase, which would be the first such step since 2011.
The decision is the latest evidence of Beijing fiddling with the dials of monetary policy to tamp down rampant credit growth, while simultaneously keeping enough liquidity in the financial system for banks to meet funding needs and prevent market panic.
""Undoubtedly this is a tightening signal,"" said Pin Ru Tan, director of Asia-Pacific rates strategy at HSBC Holdings PLC in Singapore. ""One of China's top priorities this year is to reduce financial leverage, prevent asset bubbles and avoid a systemic crisis.""
Last week, the People's Bank of China pumped 1.13 trillion yuan (roughly $165 billion) --a weekly record--into domestic money markets ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, when Chinese traditionally give gifts of cash in red envelopes. The rush of cash withdrawals tends to tighten liquidity this time of year, particularly because markets will be closed from Jan. 27 through Feb. 2.
Chinese officials have put deleveraging at the top of their agenda for 2017, after a flood of cheap, post-financial- crisis money pushed up prices of financial assets from real estate and corporate bonds to iron ore and soybean- meal futures. China's money supply has more than quadrupled since 2007, sending more cash after a shrinking pool of appealing investment options, just as capital controls keep money coursing through Chinese assets rather than those abroad.
The build-up of credit in the bond market began in 2015, when the central bank started holding short-term borrowing rates at very low, stable levels to boost growth. By the summer of 2016, roughly 90% of interbank borrowing was in the overnight market, the shortest and cheapest form of funding.
Many investors used the cheap cash to buy bonds and other financial products, and then used those securities as collateral to invest even more. Much of this borrowing was done through off-balance sheet products, adding layers of leverage and financial risk beyond regulators' view.
Officials started to crack down on this pattern in August, by pushing borrowers to longer-term maturities, which elevates short-term funding costs. The impact of this gradual tightening campaign combined with a more hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve and default scares triggered a deep selloff in the onshore bond market in mid-December.
At that point, China halted trading in some bond futures contracts for the first time, after 10-year and five-year futures fell 2% and 1.2%, respectively. Currently, 10-year bond futures are down 0.90% and five-year bond futures are down 0.50%.
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 159 of 1177
Officials' deleveraging efforts have shown some signs of success: The daily volume of overnight transactions has fallen to 1.96 trillion yuan from a peak of nearly 4 trillion yuan over the summer, according to BNP Paribas. Now, roughly 70% of interbank borrowing is in the overnight market.
China's decision to raise rates on medium-term lending facilities by 0.1 percentage point--to 2.95% for the six- month and 3.10% for the one-year tenor--isn't terribly dramatic. More important, for market watchers, is the affirmation that officials' tighter stance is here to stay.
""While the size of the rate increase is modest, the signal seems clear that the PBOC has stepped up the tightening bias,"" wrote economists at Goldman Sachs in a note.
Despite temporary bouts of volatility, there are some signs that the long-term view on China's bond market is nevertheless optimistic.
On Wednesday, Bloomberg announced that it would create two new indexes, set to launch March 1, that will include China's onshore government and policy bank bonds.
The move could accelerate inclusion into other closely tracked international bond indexes, such as J.P. Morgan's emerging-market government bond index, and accelerate foreign participation in China's onshore bond market, said Becky Liu, a China macro strategist at Standard Chartered. Foreigners currently own less than 2% of China's onshore bond market.
Index providers have been charting China's progress in opening up its financial markets as a condition for inclusion. Deutsche Bank estimates that China's addition to some indexes could help boost foreign investment inflows into China to $700 billion-$800 billion over the next five years.

Just what banking regulation will be like under President Donald Trump remains unclear. But recent comments by Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin suggest he might be looking across the Atlantic to the U.K. for inspiration.
That isn't necessarily good news for investors in the biggest U.S. lenders.
In his Senate testimony last week and in written responses to senators this week , Mr. Mnuchin repeatedly raised the specter of some kind of ""21st Century Glass-Steagall,"" without giving any details.
Mr. Mnuchin clearly doesn't favor a simple return to the Great Depression-era law. In his written comments, Mr. Mnuchin said that ""a bright line between commercial and investment banking...may inhibit the necessary lending and capital markets activities to support a robust economy.""
So what does Mr. Mnuchin want? So far, he isn't saying. But one possibility would be a ""ringfencing"" of retail bank operations such as that being put in place in the U.K., says Karen Petrou, analyst at Federal Financial Analytics. Under this system, U.K. banks like Barclays and HSBC must establish separate subsidiaries that contain their local
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 161 of 1177
U.K. operations serving individuals and small businesses, funded by government-guaranteed deposits. Their global investment-banking businesses stand outside this ringfence with their own capital, allowing them in theory to be wound down if they run into trouble without endangering the retail bank or necessitating a government bailout. Legislation along these lines could conceivably garner support from both parties, avoiding a Democratic filibuster in the Senate.
Such a scheme also could help Mr. Mnuchin square his seemingly contradictory comments on the Volcker rule. He has said banks with federally insured deposits shouldn't be taking trading risks with their own money, but also that trading restrictions on those banks have harmed market liquidity.
For universal banks like J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America, the potential implications are huge. They would have to decide if it is worth incurring the costs of undergoing a ringfencing process, including potentially higher overall capital requirements , or if it would be more efficient to just break up, potentially losing some synergies between units. Either way, it will be a cumbersome process.
Another question is how the hived-off investment-banking units would be funded. It would be problematic if they were overly dependent on short-term wholesale finance, as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were. One possible source of funding would be corporate deposits, which aren't insured.
U.S. banks don't necessarily want another regulatory revamp that forces further rethinking of fundamental business models, after years of adapting to current rules. Tweaks to the existing system, such as looser Volcker- rule enforcement, would suit them just fine.
But in today's political scene, big banks can't bet on getting exactly what they want. Until the regulatory outlook is clearer, investors should be mindful of the risks.

crucial differences between today's industry and the postcrisis world of 2010-13.
Brands can no longer guarantee growth by opening hundreds of new stores. Most already have retail estates stretching well into the Chinese mainland. Companies are therefore looking to improve the productivity of the stores they already have--a sensible strategy, but one that inevitably pits them against each other more than they are used to.
Second, luxury consumers, including in China, are increasingly choosing innovation over tradition. Burberry reported last week that ""fashion"" -- or newly designed items--outperformed sales of core products like its famous trench coats in the Christmas quarter. Such is the thirst for novelty that the British brand is experimenting with a ""see now, buy now "" model, whereby clothes modeled on the fashion-show runway are immediately available for sale.
This trend is a challenge for companies used to selling products on the basis of timeless appeal. It is also a challenge for investors. Barclays has charted social media mentions and ""likes"" in an effort to assess ""brand heat,"" but admits it is hard to draw firm conclusions.
An alternative way to gauge fashionability is to look at the share of a brand's product range that has been recently redesigned. Companies don't typically advertise data of this kind, but one that has reason to is Gucci, which accounts for three-fifths of operating profits at luxury group Kering. Following a complete product overhaul since the appointment of a new creative director in early 2015, more than 80% of Gucci products for sale in the third quarter were new--up from 50% to 60% in the second quarter. Quarterly sales rocketed 17% year-over-year, suggesting this is having a major impact. In the fourth quarter, some 90% of products were new, which bodes well. Share prices have risen sharply across the sector since October. Sector bellwether LVMH Moe?t Hennessy Louis Vuitton now trades at 24 times prospective earnings, well above the 10-year average. With expectations already high, investors need to be careful they don't buy shares in a company that only participates halfheartedly in the rebound. A clear turnaround story like Gucci may be the best hedge against disappointment.

Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was up 1.4%, Korea's Kospi added 0.9% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 1.3%. Markets in Australia were closed for a holiday.
The postelection equities rally in the U.S. has been spurred by hopes of fiscal spending, tax cuts and regulation rollback under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.
Investors are upbeat that those expectations will soon be realized, given the speed with which Mr. Trump has been making executive orders just days into his administration, helping drive gains this week in the U.S.
""He has started to move...He has started to take action,"" said Margaret Yang, an analyst at CMC Markets.
On Wednesday, the Dow gained 155 points, or 0.8%, to 20,068, while the S&P 500 added 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1%. For Thursday, the market will be on the lookout for a slew of U.S. data, ranging from

jobless claims to new home sales.
""There is more confidence in the U.S...The question is whether [Donald Trump's] protectionism is going to undermine that,"" said Andrew Sullivan, managing director of sales trading at Haitong International Securities.
In Asia, participants in several large markets are closing out positions ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, said Mr. Sullivan, with trading volumes down for the day. ""They don't want to be exposed until China comes back,"" he said.
Markets in China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam will be closed on Friday, with China closed through next Thursday.
Meanwhile, Thursday's stock gains in Asia were being driven by brokerage stocks. In Japan, Nomura Holdings was up 4.6% and Daiwa Securities Group was 3.8% higher. In Hong Kong, U.K. banking giant HSBC Holdings was last up 1.8%.
In currencies, the New Zealand dollar rose markedly against the U.S. unit after data showed that the country's inflation rose more than expected in the fourth quarter.
Consumer prices gained 0.4% in the fourth quarter and by 1.3% for the year, Statistics New Zealand said Thursday. Economists had expected consumer prices to rise 0.3% in the last three months of the year and by 1.2% over the year.
The New Zealand dollar rose to US$0.7300 from just below US$0.7270 before the report. In equities, the New Zealand NZX-50 index was up 0.3%.

5-Mar-18,49.4,49.51,48.9241,49.04,1423610,HSBC,"The British pound hit its highest level against the dollar since mid-December in early trade Thursday, the latest twist in what has been a particularly volatile period for the currency.
That choppiness was again on display Thursday. After rising early in the day, sterling fell back during the European afternoon amid broad dollar strength. By Thursday afternoon in New York, the pound was at $1.2590, down from $1.2633 late Wednesday in New York.
Those moves came as U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May headed to the U.S. ahead of a meeting with President Donald Trump on Friday to lay the groundwork for a trade deal between the two countries.
Many investors remain bearish on sterling, which has climbed roughly 5% since a recent low earlier this month but is still down about 16% since June's U.K. vote to leave the European Union .
Still, the avalanche of negative bets that has built up at various points in recent months appears to have eased
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 169 of 1177
somewhat lately, some gauges show. That suggests sterling choppiness may subside in the short term, though that could easily change once formal Brexit negotiations begin. The U.K. Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that Parliament must approve Brexit before the government can trigger the process.
Markets tend to be particularly vulnerable to sharp moves when investor positioning is lopsided, analysts said. Moves higher in the currency can encourage those ""shorting"" the pound--or betting on declines--to buy it back to limit losses. Similarly, moves lower can quickly turn into a free fall if the sentiment on a currency is overwhelmingly negative, as seen during the pound ""flash crash "" last October.
How Many Dollars One Pound Buys
But hard information on currency markets is sparse. Here is some of what is available on who has been selling sterling and what that might tell us about its direction.
What public data are available?
Not much. Sterling accounts for 13% of the $5.1 trillion that changes hands every day in foreign-exchange markets, according to the Bank for International Settlements. But most of that is traded through large investment banks in the opaque over-the-counter market. The best-known public data come from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The U.S. regulator releases weekly positioning from various investors on sterling futures contracts, a type of exchange-traded derivative.
What does that information say?
Speculative investors are betting on further declines in the pound. Speculators, or noncommercial investors as the CFTC calls them, hold 66,242 more short sterling contracts--options that bet sterling will fall--than long sterling. Still, that is some way down from the record of 97,572 more short positions in October after U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said she planned to start formal negotiations to leave the EU by the end of March this year. Speculative Investors' Net Positions on Sterling
Are the CFTC data any good?
To an extent. Traders pore over the data for clues on how the market is set up. But there are various flaws. The numbers reflect positioning on a Tuesday but aren't released until Friday--a considerable time lag for a market that trades on day-to-day news. Some analysts take issue with the broad-brush categories for different types of investors. And the information captures only a small subsection of the foreign-exchange market. It accounts for only $115 billion of foreign-exchange trades a day in exchange-traded instruments such as futures and options, according to the BIS, a tiny amount of overall volumes.
So what else is there to look at?
Some banks have developed their own proprietary models to estimate currency positioning. Strategists at HSBC Holdings PLC have developed an index that aims to replicate how ""momentum,"" or trend following, hedge funds are positioned on a currency. When a currency falls, trend followers will generally go short. If the pound rises consistently, they will flip to going long.
HSBC Positioning on Pound vs. Dollar
The statistics derived from these models are significant because a lot of big funds trade on momentum, said Mark McDonald, head of FX quantitative strategy at HSBC. But they are also important because a lot of active managers inadvertently hold momentum positions, he argues, as price action influences investment decisions. ""It's human nature,"" Mr. McDonald said.
The HSBC index suggests short positioning on sterling has eased lately from extreme levels earlier this month. Then what do the different data tell us?
The pound shouldn't be quite so volatile, at least for now. Less extreme positioning should mean moves in either direction are more muted. But expect things to change as the U.K. gets closer to triggering formal exit negotiations with the EU.
Are there buyers of the pound?
Yes. By definition, every seller of a currency needs a buyer. And there are data to suggest the buyers include some of the world's biggest investors: central banks. Sterling claims in central-bank foreign-exchange reserves increased

roughly $2 billion in the third quarter of 2016, to $350.83 billion, according to the latest available data from the International Monetary Fund. That is up from $311.92 billion in the third quarter of 2015, despite a small decline in total foreign reserves over that period.

5-Mar-18,49.43,49.56,49.36,49.39,1408302,HSBC,"Brexit, what Brexit ? The U.K. economy has remained buoyant after the country's historic June vote to leave the European Union. That will raise questions about the Bank of England's policy path.
Growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 was 0.6% from the previous three months, the Office for National Statistics said Thursday--the same as
in the second and third quarters . Growth overall in 2016 was 2%, only just below 2015's 2.2%. Back in August, the BOE forecast ""little GDP growth"" in the second half of the year, leading it to cut rates and restart government-bond purchases. As the BOE meets next week, those purchases will be coming to an end.
The continued strength of the economy and the sharp rise in inflation --which is expected to increase well above the BOE target of 2% this year--would normally be pointing to an increase in interest rates. The market now thinks there is a 50% chance that the BOE will raise rates by December, economists at HSBC note.
But the BOE has signaled it can overlook the rise in inflation as a temporary effect from the falling pound. And there are still reasons for caution on growth. The strength in the economy in the fourth quarter all came from services: the U.K. economy is still very lopsided. The BOE may well want to see what happens once Brexit discussions with the EU start in earnest. Consumers face a tougher 2017 due to rising inflation.
Set against that is a stronger global backdrop. While the BOE will want to take some credit for the effect of its easing measures, the broad picture is one of stronger growth in many parts of the world, which should benefit the U.K.
The test for the BOE could come later this year. If the U.K. economy continues to provide positive surprises, then it will be harder for policy makers to ignore rising inflation. But the BOE has long been adept at adopting a stance of masterly inactivity. That seems the likely course for now.

5-Mar-18,49.26,49.6,49.19,49.55,1311390,HSBC,"For a plan to come together there has to be one in the first place. As India finds itself grappling with a sudden fall from grace, an economic blueprint continues to elude policy makers.
World-beating growth numbers of over 7% might look good when global growth is sagging, but the underlying drivers aren't so solid. Half of India's gross domestic product isn't actually improving. Meanwhile, of the other half, 15% is growing because of lower commodity prices and a third of that improvement is because of government actions, according to an HSBC analysis.
Since the government drained 86% of the cash in the Indian economy in November, economic activity has fallen sharply with no signs of recovery yet. Large swaths of the rural economy have been strangled just as consumption, a key source of growth, was gaining momentum, worsening India's chronic problems.
India's ad hoc reforms have led to colliding policy motives and consequences. In the most recent example, Prime Minister Modi has talked up an export-led model by endorsing the merits of his Make in India manufacturing program at a time when policy makers across the world are grappling with the rising threat of global protectionism. However, the cash-drain exercise pummeled the informal sector, home over to about a fifth of manufacturing jobs and nearly a quarter of India's GDP. Industries like leather, a key focus of Mr. Modi's manufacturing program, have seen production fall by 60% after the demonetization.
India continues to struggle in boosting fixed investment which continues to hover around just over a quarter of GDP, barely budging since a year ago. Meanwhile, subsidies and other expenditure make up a majority of government spending. Credit growth remains anemic because funding channels are clogged even as easy credit is extended to areas that won't ultimately boost investment. When Mr. Modi took office he embarked on global roadshows to lure investors. Global companies, though, have either withdrawn or are second-guessing plans to break ground in India, lamenting bureaucratic red tape.
None of this is new, but, considering the reformer Mr. Modi is touted to be, it is surprising such pitfalls haven't been made priorities. Government finances are in better shape. Fiscal discipline shouldn't mean capital spending loses primacy, though. Going by Mr. Modi's year-end speech, much will be spent on largely populist social spending ahead of key provincial elections . And, as the effect of low oil prices wears off, energy costs will divert cash away from investment and the recapitalization of weak public-sector banks just as nonperforming assets continue to build up.
In an ideal world, public investment could inspire confidence in the private sector and lure in long-term money rather than opportunistic investments. In India's case, a 1 percentage point GDP increase in the government's capital expenditure could lead to a 1.1 percentage point increase in real GDP growth over 18 months, according to HSBC analysts, pointing to the government's key role.
Business confidence has slumped and deep-pocketed investors, while appreciating conviction, now seriously question the unskilled execution of the cash reform that sent the economy on a downward trajectory for the foreseeable future.

5-Mar-18,49.12,49.2,48.875,49.09,1278213,HSBC,"The pace of big Chinese takeovers abroad is slowing as buyers contend with rules tightening the flow of money out of the country and increased government scrutiny at home and overseas.
Bankers say many of the record-breaking $225 billion in overseas acquisitions Chinese companies announced last year are stalled by financial or regulatory hurdles--including the country's biggest-ever deal, China National Chemical Corp.'s $43 billion bid for Syngenta AG , a Swiss seed and pesticide maker. European regulators this month extended the deadline for their review of ChemChina's bid a second time, to April.
More Chinese acquirers are backing out of deals. While Chinese firms announced more than double the amount of overseas acquisitions last year versus the previous, the value of deals withdrawn in 2016 was up around sevenfold, to $38.39 billion, according to Dealogic. The average number of days it took a Chinese buyer to complete an overseas deal in 2016 edged upward throughout the year, with November and December notching the highest levels, at above 140 days, according to Dealogic.
A major factor behind the slowdown: stricter policing of overseas acquisitions by Chinese regulators to curb a flood of money leaving the country.
The resulting uncertainty about regulatory approvals has damped some investors' enthusiasm for overseas deals. ""It is unmistakable that Chinese investors are far more cautious amid mounting uncertainties,"" said Fred Hu, chairman of Primavera Capital. Mr. Hu's Chinese private-equity firm is a prominent deal maker involved in last year's biggest U-turn: Anbang Insurance Group Co. dropping its $14 billion bid for Starwood Hotels &Resorts Worldwide Inc.
Mergers and acquisitions the world over go through cycles, and given the size, wealth and ambition of corporate China, financiers say the country's surge in overseas, or outbound, deals is likely not stopping, but taking a break. Some well-connected Chinese acquirers are still striking smaller deals. Ant Financial Services Group, an affiliate of online shopping giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., clinched a deal Thursday to buy U.S. money-transfer provider MoneyGram International Inc. for $880 million . Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. also agreed to sell its Dendreon cancer business to Chinese conglomerate Sanpower for $820 million earlier this month.
""In the long run, the trend of China Inc. going global should not be affected"" by the current foreign-exchange controls, said Wang Hongzhang, chairman of state lender China Construction Bank Corp., at a January event in Hong Kong. His bank offers financing for many Chinese outbound deals, including Anbang's Starwood bid.
For now, though, Chinese companies are increasingly anxious about deals abroad--particularly the biggest, which get the most scrutiny.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 176 of 1177
Chinese regulators, including the Commerce Ministry and the country's top economic-planning agency, must now clear many outbound deals larger than $1 billion, as well as everything more than $10 billion, before companies can get approval to move funds offshore, according to people with knowledge of the matter and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Regulators also are retroactively examining many pending deals that had earlier been approved, causing delays, according to people familiar with the matter.
State-owned China Resources Beer (Holdings) Co. dropped out of an auction for Eastern Europe brewing assets being sold by Anheuser-Busch InBev SA NV in December, after China's economic-planning agency declined to approve its bid, according to people familiar with the situation. Representatives for China Resources and AB InBev declined to comment.
Meanwhile, Chinese deals continue to face scrutiny from overseas regulators. Australia this month said it will set up a new body to assess security risks of foreign investments, following a surge in Chinese bids to purchase everything from ports to electricity assets. Anbang's $1.57 billion acquisition of U.S. life insurer Fidelity &Guaranty Life has stalled for more than a year because the Chinese insurer hasn't provided enough detail on its ownership to satisfy state insurance regulators, people familiar with the matter said. One of these people said Anbang is in talks with New York regulators and plans to refile its application in the first quarter.
Many sellers are asking for money to be placed in offshore escrow accounts to ensure they get paid, a development that has become common in the past year, bankers and lawyers say. HNA Group deposited $500 million in a U.S. account as breakup fee for its $6.5 billion proposed purchase of a 25% stake in Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.
State-owned ChemChina already was grappling with a heavy debt load before it struck the Syngenta deal. Worries about those debt levels caused one Chinese state bank to pass on financing the bid, according to people familiar with the situation. ChemChina's Chairman Ren Jianxin tapped HSBC Holdings PLC and China Citic Bank International Ltd. to lead the $33 billion loan-financing effort. The lack of strong backing from big state lenders raised questions among investors over whether the deal had full support from Beijing.
A ChemChina spokesman declined to comment and declined to make Mr. Ren available for comment.
The deal was approved in August by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. , or CFIUS, which scrutinizes deals for national-security risks and has blocked several high-profile Chinese deals during the past few years. In Europe, antimonopoly regulators are still combing through ChemChina's and Syngenta's assets to determine what may need to be divested after extending the deadline twice.
China's Commerce Ministry too has yet to give the nod, a person familiar with the matter said. It isn't clear whether the Chinese economic-planning agency is currently examining the deal.
""ChemChina and Syngenta remain fully committed to the transaction and are confident of its closure,"" said a Syngenta spokesman.
Mr. Ren has been undeterred by the delays, telling people around him not to worry about the fate of the Syngenta deal, and that the current obstacles won't influence other potential deals, people familiar with the matter said.

Ackerman's Take: Aspiring Fed Vice Chairmen--Caveat Emptor
Bankers are waiting with bated breath to see who ends up in the Federal Reserve post responsible for overseeing Wall Street . Yet the powerful job--Fed vice chair of supervision--has some significant drawbacks about which any aspirant should be forewarned.
For one thing, the job comes with no dedicated legal staff. Unlike other Senate-confirmed officials at federal financial agencies, Fed governors don't have their own cadre of attorneys charged with helping to craft speeches and policy statements. SEC commissioners, for instance, would generally be unable to slog through the at-times crushing legal workload without a stable of three or four experienced attorneys who are experts in specific areas of the law and work only for their bosses.
Though Fed governors increasingly have an assistant or two, they lack their own dedicated legal team and must instead rely on the central bank's legal staff at large. That has given some candidates pause when weighing whether to seek the position, according to lobbyists familiar with the thinking of some individuals who have interviewed for the role.
The post in question was created by Congress in 2010, but it has never been filled. Fed governor Daniel Tarullo, who has been effectively doing the job, has used the role to exert significant influence over the largest U.S. banks. His term as Fed governor expires in 2022, though he could step down sooner .
(David Nason, a Treasury official under President George W. Bush who now leads GE Energy Financial Services,
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 179 of 1177
has emerged as the front-runner for the bank-oversight job, The Wall Street Journal has reported , citing people familiar with the matter.)
Mr. Tarullo's power derives in large part from his ability to lead senior attorneys and supervisors who work for the Fed broadly--not for him--and who interpret whether the central bank's actions are consistent with the 2010 Dodd- Frank Act and other laws. More significantly, perhaps, Mr. Tarullo has maintained the backing of two successive Fed chiefs, who deferred to his views on regulatory and staffing issues, and he has proved adept at building consensus.
Anyone Mr. Trump nominates to the post probably won't enjoy the same degree of institutional support. A Trump nominee will aim to undo or ease much of the Fed's postcrisis work--an approach unlikely to gain traction with the agency's staff or with its chairwoman, Janet Yellen, who has said she intends to serve out her term through February 2018.
Moreover, other members of the Fed board can stay longer--so it might take years before a majority of the board's members are Trump appointees supportive of the new president's deregulatory bent.
To be sure, it's unlikely anyone would turn down a request from the White House to fill one of the most powerful regulatory posts in the federal government. But the role comes with significant challenges that will complicate the agenda of the new vice chair.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond
New Mnuchin Pay Disclosure Shows a $5.6 Million Payout
By Rachel Louise Ensign
During his final 15 months as a banker, Treasury Secretary-nominee Steven Mnuchin earned around $5.6 million in wages, bonus and incentive compensation, according to pay disclosures related to his confirmation process.
That is well below what Wall Street chieftains make, but still generous in comparison to executives at other regional banks, executive-compensation specialists said. Despite his Goldman Sachs Group Inc. pedigree, Mr. Mnuchin in his confirmation hearing described himself as a regional banker, the role he held in recent years.
Earlier disclosures from CIT Group Inc. of Mr. Mnuchin's compensation only covered a five-month period in 2015. The new disclosures, released earlier this month by the Office of Government Ethics, cover his pay for seven months spent as chief executive of the parent company of OneWest Bank and eight months as vice chairman of CIT.
In addition to his pay for that period in 2015 and 2016, Mr. Mnuchin also exercised stock options, received a ""dividend equivalent payment"" and had stock grants vest, the new disclosures show. Combined with a previously reported severance package, that brings his total for 2015 and most of 2016 to more than $39 million, although it is likely that the stock and option grants would have been earned in prior periods.
A spokesman for Mr. Mnuchin declined to comment.

Mr. Mnuchin and fellow investors created OneWest Bank in 2009 by buying failed IndyMac Bank at the height of the financial crisis. He sold it to CIT in August 2015 for $3.4 billion, more than double the initial investment for IndyMac, and left CIT management in March 2016 as part of a shake-up.
The new disclosures don't precisely match what a bank would disclose in a proxy filing. For one, they cover more than just a one-year period. Nor do they break down what Mr. Mnuchin was paid as chief executive and what he received when he moved to his other role. A small portion may be fees for serving as a CIT director after he left the vice chairman role.
Prorating the disclosed amount to an annual basis indicates Mr. Mnuchin would have earned about $4.5 million in wages and incentive compensation. That figure is in line with his target compensation for 2015, 2016 and 2017 as detailed in the OneWest merger agreement with CIT.
That is more than the pay of a typical chief executive at a bank around the size of OneWest, which had $23 billion in assets when it was sold. Such CEOs earned a median $3.7 million in compensation in 2015, according to consulting firm Compensation Advisory Partners.
In the earlier disclosure covering just five months of 2015, CIT had said Mr. Mnuchin was paid $1.3 million in wages and incentive pay. He also received $5.2 million to settle a so-called tax-gross-up obligation related to stock options, and $10.9 million in severance.
The so-called tax gross-up, where the bank agreed to give Mr. Mnuchin money to help cover tax payments, and large severance package--both previously disclosed--are unusual items for a public-company executive, compensation consultants said. Tax gross-up payments are ""a waning practice"" at public companies because they are ""viewed unfavorably"" by shareholders, said Eric Hosken, partner at Compensation Advisory Partners.
The payment was agreed to by OneWest, which was privately held, before the firm's sale and the bank had reserved for it, CIT said in a filing last year.
Over all, the amount Mr. Mnuchin got from OneWest and CIT as shown in the earlier and latest disclosures is high, compensation consultant Alan Johnson said. ""For a $23-billion bank, that's a lot of money,"" he said.
Fed Sends BB&T Cease-and-Desist Order Over Anti-Money-Laundering Issues By Katy Burne and Rachel Louise Ensign
The Federal Reserve said Friday that it had issued a cease-and-desist order to BB&T Corp. over alleged deficiencies in its anti-money-laundering controls, rounding out the latest regulatory action against the bank for recent failures in that area.
The cease-and-desist order, which is on the more severe end of the Fed's enforcement scale, means the bank must show it is complying with anti-money-laundering rules until the central bank removes or otherwise modifies the order.
The Fed's action, which came with the firm's consent, followed another supervisory action issued to BB&T, based in Winston-Salem, N.C., last year by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and North Carolina Commissioner of
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 181 of 1177

Banks. That order also came with the bank's consent. BB&T, which had $219.3 billion in assets as of Dec. 31, disclosed the likely consent order with the Fed in a December securities filing.
Brian Davis, a BB&T spokesman, said the firm has a ""long history of quickly addressing regulatory concerns,"" and has already made ""significant enhancements"" to its anti-money laundering compliance program. He said the firm is ""committed to working alongside our regulatory partners to implement the needed improvements as quickly as possible.""
Such orders don't state that the bank has laundered money, but rather that their internal systems for detecting criminal activity and reporting it to the government are deemed unsound by regulators. The policing of such violations has become more severe since the financial crisis.
The Fed's order, taken Wednesday with mutual agreement by the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks, follows a recent inspection by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, which said it had identified gaps in BB&T's anti- money-laundering controls.
It requires BB&T to adopt measures to reassure the Fed and other regulators that it is taking corrective steps. These steps include submitting written plans within 60 days to ensure enhanced oversight of the controls by the firm's board of directors, and progress reports at the end of each quarter.
The Fed's order said BB&T had to adopt ""a firm-wide compliance risk management program designed to ensure compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to anti-money laundering, including compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act.""
The bank has been one of the few acquisitive large banks, and the consent order likely halts its mergers-and- acquisitions appetite. Banks generally can't acquire other lenders when they are under such an order, though Chief Executive Kelly King said on BB&T's recent earnings call that the bank could still do nonbank deals like buying firms in the insurance industry.
A number of other regional banks are also under consent orders. The orders themselves, and the elevated costs for compliance systems and personnel to deal with them, often drag on longer than banks expect.
WSJ Pro: EU Officials Wait to See How Trump Will Approach Financial Regulation Before Acting on New Rules By Julia-Ambra Verlaine
BRUSSELS--European Union finance officials are waiting to see how U.S. President Donald Trump will approach financial regulation before agreeing to finalize post-crisis rules proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.
The international standards setter was supposed to complete new rules around global bank capital requirements in January, but unexpectedly postponed a key meeting at the beginning of the month.
The body in its announcement didn't attribute the delay to the U.S. presidential election, instead saying it needed more time to consider the potential impact of rules on banks. But European Union officials and bankers said uncertainty around the future of regulation in the U.S. had a part to play.

""I can understand and empathize with the committee to wait a little bit--once the dust settles they could take a more longer-term decision,"" Malta's Finance Minister Edward Scicluna told reporters Friday, ahead of a meeting of EU finance ministers.
Mr. Trump during his political campaign vowed to overhaul rules around banks. On Thursday, Mr. Trump raised the issue in remarks at a retreat for House Republicans, saying, ""We will also pursue financial reform that will help striving Americans get the credit they need to realize their dreams."" At the same retreat, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said legislation to alleviate regulation on the financial sector would be a priority.
Negotiations around rules to safeguard banks and prevent another too-big-to-fail scenario, such as the downfall of Lehman Brothers, leave in place for now regulatory uncertainty for European banks.
The main roadblock in the Basel III changes has been a debate around the so-called output floor, which would set a strict limit on the amount of flexibility banks have in evaluating their risk--and therefore how much capital they must put aside to cushion potential losses.
EU financial services chief, Valdis Dombrovskis, said the the bloc was waiting for the U.S. administration to explain its priorities so negotiations could advance.
""At this stage we don't have any concrete indications from the new U.S administration,"" Mr. Dombrovskis said after the EU ministerial meeting.
""From the EU side we are ready to work towards an agreement--there was clear consensus for this in today's [meeting].""
He added that he couldn't say when final standards might be agreed.
Mr. Dombrovskis, who is half a year into his role as head of financial services at the EU's executive arm, the European Commission, said capital requirements for European banks could increase significantly if the floor was set too high.
""We want to reach an agreement without harming Europe's economic recovery,"" he said. ""Given the fact that the agreement will shape aspects of banking regulation for the years to come it is important to concentrate on getting the agreement right."".
Former Goldman Employee Alleges Co-Workers Knew of Plans to Get Fed Secrets By Katy Burne
A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. associate has alleged that three of the firm's current employees knew in 2014 about his illegal efforts to get secrets from the Federal Reserve, according to new legal documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
The former employee, Rohit Bansal, in 2015 pleaded guilty in a Manhattan federal district court to misappropriating confidential information about a midsize bank the Fed supervised, and which Goldman was advising at the time. He was sentenced to two years' probation. He also received a lifetime ban from banking from the Fed.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 183 of 1177

The Fed referred to that midsize bank client in previous legal filings as ""Bank A,"" but the new legal documents-- related to an enforcement action against a former Goldman managing director--indicate it was New York Community Bancorp, based in Westbury, N.Y. One of the documents names an employee of ""Bank A,"" and that employee worked for New York Community Bancorp at the time of the theft of the information, according to the bank's annual reports.
Patrick Quinn, counsel to New York Community Bancorp, said, ""The entire matter is subject to a confidentiality order,"" and declined to comment further.
Before joining Goldman in the summer of 2014, Mr. Bansal had worked for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A 2015 order from the New York State Department of Financial Services said the New York Fed asked him to resign after he was caught falsifying records. Mr. Bansal's take on the matter wasn't detailed in the order. Scott Morvillo, Mr. Bansal's lawyer, had no immediate comment.
In filings from previous legal proceedings, Mr. Bansal was accused of getting secrets about ""Bank A"" from a Fed employee on Sept. 23, 2014, at a dinner at Peter Luger Steak House in Brooklyn, N.Y., and emailing the information to a Goldman managing director, Joseph Jiampietro, later the same night.
Goldman said it fired Messrs. Bansal and Jiampietro after it learned of the events and settled civil charges brought separately against it by the Fed and the New York State Department of Financial Services, for $36.3 million and $50 million, respectively.
Mr. Bansal is now a witness for the Fed in a civil enforcement action it is pursuing against Mr. Jiampietro. The Fed accuses Mr. Jiampietro of asking Mr. Bansal to get Fed secrets for use in presentations to clients seeking their business. It also has accused Mr. Jiampietro of related misconduct going back to 2012 and is seeking to fine him $337,500.
Preliminary witness lists in Mr. Jiampietro's case reveal Mr. Bansal said in a 2016 deposition that four other Goldman executives had direct knowledge of conversations about him obtaining confidential Fed materials. Three of them still work for Goldman; a fourth is no longer employed by the firm.
The deposition isn't public, but some of its contents are referenced in the witness lists, which circulated between the Fed's enforcement counsel and Mr. Jiampietro's lawyers in December.
The Fed hasn't accused the four current and former Goldman employees of any wrongdoing, and their names don't appear on the Fed's preliminary witness list, indicating it doesn't anticipate calling them to testify. Darren Gersh, a Fed spokesman, declined to comment.
Goldman said it stands by the employees--managing directors Phil Labbe and Scott Romanoff; Pratik Pareek, a vice president; and a former employee, Rajat Agarwal, who was a vice president at the time of the events. All four are on the witness list for Mr. Jiampietro's defense.
A spokesman for the bank, Michael DuVally, said in a statement that Messrs. Bansal and Jiampietro, the ""two ex- employees, whom we promptly terminated after the firm self-identified the conduct, are the only ones we believe warranted sanction or discipline.""
Mr. DuVally also said the current employees declined to comment. Attempts to reach Mr. Agarwal were
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 184 of 1177

unsuccessful.
The revelations in the deposition constitute the latest twist in the Fed's lengthy investigation of the 2014 leak that stoked concerns about close ties between the regulator and Wall Street, and of employees who move between the two in what critics have called a ""revolving door"" pattern.
The night of the steakhouse dinner, Mr. Bansal learned from his former Fed colleague about the examination rating the Fed was about to assign to ""Bank A,"" according to previous legal filings.
The Fed alleges Mr. Bansal relayed the rating information to Mr. Jiampietro the same night because Mr. Jiampietro had asked him to get it. The Fed said Mr. Jiampietro shared it with others inside Goldman the next morning.
Mr. Jiampietro's lawyers say Mr. Bansal was acting on his own. Mr. Jiampietro ""never requested Mr. Bansal obtain CSI [confidential supervisory information] from any source, never knew that he had done so, never saw any document he believed to be improperly obtained CSI, and never knowingly used improperly obtained CSI,"" his lawyer, Adam Ford of the law firm Ford O'Brien LLP, said in a legal filing.
According to a witness list compiled by the defense, Mr. Bansal testified in his 2016 deposition that in 2014, Messrs. Pareek and Agarwal attended several meetings with Messrs. Bansal and Jiampietro where confidential Fed documents were discussed and Mr. Bansal was asked by the other men to get the rating information about ""Bank A"" and other confidential documents because it would help their careers.
Mr. Bansal also testified in the deposition, according to the witness list, that Mr. Labbe attended a meeting at which Mr. Jiampietro asked Mr. Bansal to get another confidential supervisory document for use in a presentation seeking new business.
In the deposition, Mr. Bansal stated that Mr. Jiampietro planned to call Mr. Romanoff about the ""Bank A"" rating the morning after the steak dinner.
Mr. Bansal separately testified that Mr. Romanoff had asked him whether Mr. Jiampietro instructed him to get other confidential Fed documents on his second day of work, according to the witness lists.
During a Sept. 26, 2014, conference call with Goldman employees, Mr. Bansal sent other confidential documents in an email, according to the Fed enforcement order against Mr. Jiampietro. Mr. Romanoff alerted Goldman's compliance office once he recognized their confidential nature, the Fed said in its complaint against Mr. Jiampietro.
The firm launched an inquiry into the matter, and the Fed said Goldman fired Messrs. Bansal and Jiampietro in October 2014.
An initial hearing in Mr. Jiampietro's case has been scheduled for July 25. Corrections &Amplifications
Details of a 2016 deposition of Mr. Bansal were revealed in witness lists. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the deposition was from 2015. (Jan. 27, 2017)

WSJ Pro: China Strengthens Rules on Local Exchanges
SHANGHAI--China's top administrative body has tightened rules for the country's regional equity exchanges, a month after a high-profile default on private placement bonds sold on Alibaba's fintech affiliate.
Each province will be allowed to set up only one local equity exchange. Mergers will be mandated in provinces that have more than one exchange, according to a statement posted on the State Council website on Thursday.
Issuance and transfer of private placement bonds will be banned, while eligible retail investors must hold at least 500,000 yuan ($72,606) in assets. Investors can buy or sell the securities only after at least five trading sessions have passed since the initial transaction, according to the State Council.
""Regional equity exchange markets belong to the private equity market, thus public issuance of securities is not allowed according to China's securities law,"" said the statement.
At the end of 2016, China had 40 regional equity exchanges where 17,400 listed firms had raised a total of around 287.1 billion yuan, according to the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the country's securities regulator. Intended to help finance China's cash-hungry smaller enterprises, these regional equity exchanges have been prone to financial risks due to a murky regulatory system, said a spokesperson from the CSRC Thursday.
Last month, a default on Cosun Group's private placement bonds sold through Ant Financial's online platform rippled through the investment community, highlighting how less-sophisticated investors could be exposed to risks.

Yellen to Testify Before Senate Banking Panel Feb. 14
By Kate Davidson
Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen will deliver her semiannual monetary policy report to the Senate Banking Committee on Feb. 14, a panel spokeswoman confirmed Friday.
Ms. Yellen will also testify before the House Financial Services Committee on Feb. 15, a spokesman for that committee said this week. The so-called Humphrey-Hawkins hearings--a reference to the 1978 law that requires them--will be Ms. Yellen's first appearance before Congress since the Fed raised interest rates a quarter percentage point in December.
Fed officials will meet again next week, but investors widely expect they will hold rates steady. Ms. Yellen said last week she doesn't see the U.S. economy at risk of overheating, a sign that officials are sticking with their plan to raise rates gradually in the months ahead.
Citigroup, European Banks Stick With Mexico as Trade War Looms
By Christina Rexrode in New York and Jeannette Neumann in Madrid
Big American and European banks with substantial interests in Mexico are standing fast with plans for further
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 186 of 1177

investment in that country even as trade-war talk heats up with the U.S.
Citigroup Inc. and Spain's Banco Santander SA and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA said they remain confident in their businesses in Mexico, where they control the country's top three banks. Executives have also said in recent days that while a trade war could hurt Mexico's economy, further peso weakness could make the country even more competitive globally.
""Mexico does have a lot of advantages, and those advantages as an economy would continue no matter what would happen between trade with the U.S.,"" Citigroup finance chief John Gerspach said Thursday during a call with debt investors. ""A weakening peso would again give them even more of a competitive edge.""
Citigroup owns one of Mexico's biggest banks, known as Citibanamex, and a month before the U.S. election said it planned to invest $1 billion in the country over four years to improve and refurbish operations. ""We're on pace to keep that going,"" Mr. Gerspach said of Citibanamex, which generated about 15% of Citigroup's consumer revenue in the fourth quarter.
Speaking after Santander reported fourth-quarter results Wednesday, Executive Chairman Ana Boti?n said the bank plans to move ahead with a 15 billion-peso investment announced in December to modernize bank branches, ATMs and information-technology systems during the next three years. Santander owns another of Mexico's largest banks and generates about a tenth of its net profit in that country.
""We expect to continue to do well in Mexico despite a more challenging environment,"" Ms. Boti?n said.
BBVA, which owns Mexico's largest bank, BBVA Bancomer SA, has more at stake, generating about half its net income in the country.
""In the short term, Mexico will have to cope with great challenges, but Mexico will overcome the current situation,"" BBVA Chairman Francisco Gonza?lez told The Wall Street Journal in a statement. ""Gradually policies should evolve in the right direction"" between Mexico and the U.S., he added.
For their part, investors are showing some concern but aren't selling indiscriminately. Citigroup shares have outperformed the S&P 500 since the U.S. election but have trailed the KBW Nasdaq Bank index by about 10 percentage points.
BBVA shares have lost nearly 2% since the election versus a nearly 18% gain for the Euro Stoxx Banks index. Meanwhile, Santander stock has actually outpaced the index, rising about 21% since Nov. 8.
The growing war of words between President Donald Trump and Mexico has taken a toll on the peso--it has lost about 14% of value against the dollar since Nov. 8--and raises the prospect of an economic slowdown or even recession in that country.
Given all three foreign banks' operations are focused primarily on retail and commercial banking, the lenders' profits in Mexico are closely tied to domestic demand for mortgages, consumer and business loans. And while a weaker peso could increase competitiveness, it poses a short-term headwind for the banks.
Fourth-quarter net profit at Santander's Mexico business rose 14% from a year earlier measured in pesos. But for purposes of the bank as a whole, it fell 2.3% when translated back into euros. BBVA reports fourth-quarter results

Wednesday.
Santander and BBVA executives say confidence in their ability to juggle the uncertainty in Mexico derives in part from experience managing businesses in other emerging markets. Santander has a major bank in Brazil and BBVA in Turkey.
Citigroup also has a long history in emerging markets. Speaking on his bank's earnings call earlier this month, Chief Executive Michael Corbat noted Citigroup has served customers around the world ""through wars, through trade wars, through depressions, through recessions.""
Still, Mexico could prove disruptive for Citigroup if, say, President Trump opts to abandon the North American Free Trade Agreement. Some investors and analysts have in the past called on the bank to sell the Mexico operations, which were rocked by a loan-loss scandal in 2014. Scrapping Nafta, or a severe recession in Mexico, could rekindle such debate.
For now, the bank isn't changing course. Asked on Citigroup's earnings call if the bank would consider selling the Mexico business, Mr. Gerspach replied: ""No. That's not even on the table."" And Citigroup directors spent only a few minutes discussing Mexico at a board meeting in recent days, according to people familiar with the matter.
How the Mexico-U.S. trade dispute plays out, especially as it relates to the country's economy and remittances to people living there, will prove important to Citigroup and its growth prospects.
About 24% of Citibanamex's corporate loans are to companies in Mexican states along the U.S. border, which presumably would be most hurt by a more restrictive trade policy, Goldman Sachs analysts estimate based on data from Mexico bank regulators. As well, Mexico accounts for, on average, 10% of Citigroup's revenue from continuing operations, more than any market except the U.S.
Citibanamex also hosts more than 27 million consumer accounts, about half of Citigroup's total and more than two and a half times the bank's number of U.S. ones.
Of course, U.S.-Mexico relations could improve. And some bankers even think the current situation could lead to opportunity, should Nafta be revisited or renegotiated. Jorge Mariscal, emerging market chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management, said there are a number of banking issues that Nafta doesn't address, but that have been sore points for years.
For example, a new treaty could allow Mexican collateral to be used for U.S. dollar loans or make it easier for banks to have cross-border banking licenses, he said.
""The rhetoric is quite concerning,"" Mr. Mariscal said. ""It's not clear if there is a constructive road ahead. But if there is, there is both risk and opportunity.""

Big Chinese Deals Stall on Capital-Outflows Clampdown By Kane Wu and Julie Steinberg
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 188 of 1177

The pace of big Chinese takeovers abroad is slowing as buyers contend with rules tightening the flow of money out of the country and increased government scrutiny at home and overseas.
Bankers say many of the record-breaking $225 billion in overseas acquisitions Chinese companies announced last year are stalled by financial or regulatory hurdles--including the country's biggest-ever deal, China National Chemical Corp.'s $43 billion bid for Syngenta AG, a Swiss seed and pesticide maker. European regulators this month extended the deadline for their review of ChemChina's bid a second time, to April.
More Chinese acquirers are backing out of deals. While Chinese firms announced more than double the amount of overseas acquisitions last year versus the previous, the value of deals withdrawn in 2016 was up around sevenfold, to $38.39 billion, according to Dealogic. The average number of days it took a Chinese buyer to complete an overseas deal in 2016 edged upward throughout the year, with November and December notching the highest levels, at above 140 days, according to Dealogic.
A major factor behind the slowdown: stricter policing of overseas acquisitions by Chinese regulators to curb a flood of money leaving the country.
The resulting uncertainty about regulatory approvals has damped some investors' enthusiasm for overseas deals. ""It is unmistakable that Chinese investors are far more cautious amid mounting uncertainties,"" said Fred Hu, chairman of Primavera Capital. Mr. Hu's Chinese private-equity firm is a prominent deal maker involved in last year's biggest U-turn: Anbang Insurance Group Co. dropping its $14 billion bid for Starwood Hotels &Resorts Worldwide Inc.
Mergers and acquisitions the world over go through cycles, and given the size, wealth and ambition of corporate China, financiers say the country's surge in overseas, or outbound, deals is likely not stopping, but taking a break.
Some well-connected Chinese acquirers are still striking smaller deals. Ant Financial Services Group, an affiliate of online shopping giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., clinched a deal Thursday to buy U.S. money-transfer provider MoneyGram International Inc. for $880 million. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. also agreed to sell its Dendreon cancer business to Chinese conglomerate Sanpower for $820 million earlier this month.
""In the long run, the trend of China Inc. going global should not be affected"" by the current foreign-exchange controls, said Wang Hongzhang, chairman of state lender China Construction Bank Corp., at a January event in Hong Kong. His bank offers financing for many Chinese outbound deals, including Anbang's Starwood bid.
For now, though, Chinese companies are increasingly anxious about deals abroad--particularly the biggest, which get the most scrutiny.
Chinese regulators, including the Commerce Ministry and the country's top economic-planning agency, must now clear many outbound deals larger than $1 billion, as well as everything more than $10 billion, before companies can get approval to move funds offshore, according to people with knowledge of the matter and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Regulators also are retroactively examining many pending deals that had earlier been approved, causing delays, according to people familiar with the matter.

6-Mar-18,49.45,49.49,49.095,49.38,1675310,HSBC,"IN THIS ERA OF VERY LOW INTEREST RATES, some investors have turned to preferred securities, many of which yield in the neighborhood of 6%. That's certainly a lot better than the S&P 500's recent average yield of 2.1% and the 10-year U.S. Treasury note's 2.52%.
Of these securities, preferred stocks are the most common, but other preferreds include hybrid securities and small-denomination ""baby"" bonds. All have a lot in common with fixed-income. Like bonds, preferreds often pay a fixed coupon, though in some cases it can be reset. Most are callable, meaning the issuer can redeem them on a specified date. Unlike common stocks, preferreds don't come with voting rights. However, dividends of preferreds are paid before common dividends, because they are higher up in the capital structure-an advantage if the underlying company has financial problems or liquidates.
It's important to point out, however, that preferred securities aren't bulletproof, their tantalizing yields notwithstanding.
One of their risks is sector concentration. Banks, which under regulatory pressure have been rebuilding their capital positions since the financial crisis of 2007-09, are by far the biggest issuer of preferreds. Another potential worry is rising interest rates, which can pressure any security that pays a fixed coupon, regardless of whether it's a 30-year Treasury bond or a preferred stock.
And it's important to note that not all preferred securities make payments that are considered qualified dividend income. That contrasts with common stocks, whose dividends are treated as such, provided a minimum holding period is achieved. Qualified dividend income is taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. So, investors need to check on the tax treatment of specific preferred securities.
Douglas Baker, who's managed the $2.6 billion Nuveen Preferred Securities fund (ticker: NPSAX) for 10 years, calls preferreds ""an attractive addition to a portfolio, due to their income and diversification potential."" He says they have relatively low correlations with other assets, including common stocks, high-yield bonds, and investment- grade bonds.
Five of the fund's holdings are shown in the accompanying table. The fund's yield is about 5.6%, and its 10-year annual return of 6.05% places it in the top quarter of its Morningstar peer group.
Baker divides preferreds into two buckets: those geared to retail investors and that typically have a par value of $25, and those mainly favored by institutions and typically having a par value of $1,000.
The market's bifurcated structure can create opportunities, he says, because ""retail and institutional investors don't necessarily price in the risk of the asset class similarly."" Retail investors seeking yield have bid up prices, in many cases, making overall valuations in their part of the market less attractive.
Generally speaking, he continues, the two investor bases have different priorities, with the retail segment particularly interested in yield lately. Institutional buyers, Baker observes, analyze ""the income part of it, but they will also focus on things like spreads"" versus other credits, such as mortgages or corporate bonds.
As of Dec. 30, about 75% of the Nuveen fund's holdings were in the institutional part of the market, partly owing to valuations. Adding to the institutional market's allure is that it has a lot more preferred securities whose coupons
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 199 of 1177
reset, a good hedge against rising rates-and a big consideration, with the Federal Reserve having upped rates in December for the second time in 12 months. Securities whose coupons can reset at some point account for 82% of the Nuveen fund, providing some protection when rates are increasing.
But even if rates do continue to go up, it isn't necessarily a major head wind for financial stocks, at least in the short run. ""There are two sides of the interest-rate coin. If rates do increase, fundamentally the sector that's going to benefit the most is likely the bank sector,"" says Baker.
For many banks, higher rates help the spread between what they earn on their assets, notably loans, and what they pay on liabilities, including deposits. And higher rates can signal strong economic growth.
Another note of caution about preferreds: The institutional securities are typically traded over the counter, not on exchanges, making it hard for retail investors to access them directly and efficiently. Hence, an actively managed mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund often makes more sense for an individual investor interested in the institutional segment.
Another option is the iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF (PFF), which has nearly $17 billion of assets. As of Dec. 30, its 12-month trailing yield was 5.85%. Eight of its top 10 holdings are securities issued by financial firms, including Wells Fargo (WFC) and HSBC Holdings (HSBC). The fund tracks the S&P U.S. Preferred Stock Index.
Even if a preferred offers a juicy yield, there's a related danger: When rates are low, it makes economic sense for the issuer to call a high-yielding security, and replace it by issuing paper yielding less.
A hypothetical example: Say a preferred stock trades at $27.50 a share, 10% above its par price of $25.00, and pays a coupon of 7%. With the price at $27.50, the yield would be a little more than 6%$1.75 divided by the stock price. But if the bond is called in the near future at $25, the investor could lose that premium on the price. ""All of a sudden, you have to factor in a loss of 10 bond points into your total-return calculation,"" says Baker.
One reason these securities have been so popular among banks is that they help bolster their regulatory capital, something that's carefully watched these days. ""We love the fact that the banks have raised a lot of capital,"" he comments. ""That makes them safer.""

6-Mar-18,48.69,49.47,48.62,49.31,1556258,HSBC,"AFTER A BIG RALLY IN 2016, PALLADIUM PRICES ARE SURGING AGAIN. DESPITE THE run-up, investors say there are still plenty of reasons to buy the volatile metal.
Prices for palladium are up 8.1% since the beginning of the year, outperforming every precious metal but platinum. The rally comes after a nearly 21% gain last year. Investors can invest directly in the metal through the ETFS Physical Palladium Shares exchange-traded fund (ticker: PALL). Palladium for April delivery closed at $738.60 a troy ounce on Friday.
Driving the gains are expectations that an economic recovery in the U.S. and China will lift car sales, boosting demand for the precious metal, which is a key component in auto-exhaust filters. The auto industry accounts for 80% of total palladium demand, making it a crucial factor in determining the metal's price.
Car sales in China, the world's largest market, rose at their fastest pace in three years in 2016, helped by a popular tax incentive for buyers. U.S. sales rose for a seventh straight year to a new annual record. Both the U.S. and China use palladium in their catalytic converters. European cars use platinum. Overall, the global auto industry grew by 4% last year, estimates UBS Wealth Management.
That growth is likely to continue in 2017. UBS expects sales to get a boost from Brazil and Russia, whose economies are emerging from recession, even while sales in China flag as Beijing trims last year's tax break. More stringent emission regulations in North America, China, and India will require that more palladium be put into catalytic converters, buoying demand, the bank says.
Some investors also expect U.S. car sales to get a boost from fiscal stimulus launched by President Donald Trump,
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 202 of 1177
who has pledged to increase infrastructure spending and push through tax cuts. ""There were some expectations that U.S. demand would flatten out this year,"" says James Steel, a strategist at HSBC. ""If tax cuts or fiscal stimulus boost the economy, that would be good for auto demand and good for palladium.""
Prices for the metal rallied in the days leading up to Trump's inauguration, and jumped after the president urged auto company CEOs to keep production in the U.S.
Analysts also expect supplies of the metal to remain scarce in 2017. Mine production in South Africa, the world's biggest supplier of palladium, is unlikely to rise much from last year, while Russian stockpiles appear to be depleted, TD Securities has noted. The firm expects global demand to outstrip supply by 1.2 million ounces this year, up from a 632,000-ounce mismatch in 2016.
To be sure, some experts believe that palladium could be a dangerous bet in the wake of its big rally. While economic growth in the U.S. could stimulate demand, it also risks pushing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at a faster pace. Higher rates, in turn, tend to lift the dollar. A stronger U.S. currency puts pressure on commodity prices, which are denominated in dollars and become more expensive to foreign buyers when the buck rises.
Others believe there is not much room for demand to grow in the U.S., as the car market nears saturation and the economy approaches full employment. ""We believe the market is much too optimistic about the outlook for U.S. car sales in particular and global car sales in general,"" said Carsten Menke, an analyst at Julius Baer, in a note to clients. He urged investors to stay on the sidelines as palladium drifts down to about $650 a troy ounce in the next three months. *",1

Alibaba Group Holding »baba-nyse Buy *Price $98.41 on Jan. 23
by HSBC
The wide-ranging global online-commerce company, based in China, supports retail and wholesale transactions, travel planning and reservation services, subscriptionand platform-based software, cloudcomputing services, and a wide array of media, among other offerings. For the past several quarters, it has predicted that rising mobile traffic, higher user engagement, and its immense data resources will drive strong revenue growth in its core business, despite moderating growth in its gross merchandise volume, or GMV. December-quarter (fiscal third- quarter 2017) results provided evidence that this strategy is playing out.
In particular, retail revenue in China grew 42% year over year, to 41 billion renminbi [about $6 billion], a two percentage-point acceleration from fiscal secondquarter 2017. Advertising revenue increased 47% year over year and 66% quarter over quarter, as a greater number of users spent more time on the Taobao [mainly consumer-to- consumer] app and clicked on increasingly relevant ads. Commission revenue grew 32% Y/Y, reflecting strong GMV growth on Tmall [Alibaba's chief retailer-to-consumer marketplace].
Management is also exploiting other growth drivers among its businesses. Cloud revenue, for example, grew 115% Y/Y, to RMB1.8 billion. Its digital media businesses, including Youku [which is akin to YouTube], will be another growth driver as it cross-sells its 443 million annual active buyers on subscriptions to premium, exclusively digital, content.
We use a sum-of-the-parts approach to value Alibaba, which results in a target price of $125. And, because we see implied upside near 27%, we maintain our Buy rating.

Neutral *Price $76.05 on Jan. 24 by Credit Suisse
The maker of chemicals and other products for agriculture, health-care, electronics, and industrial markets, among others, posted a fourth-quarter 2016 earnings per share of 51 cents, well ahead of our 40 cents and the Street consensus of 41 cents; core earnings were only modestly better than expectations. That said, we view core operating results as yet another solid quarter of execution, with the company winding up 2016 $20 million ahead in its $730 million cost-cutting goal.
Our 2017/18 estimates are unchanged at $3.60 and $4, respectively. We are also raising our price target to $76 from $70. While the bears may highlight the light first-quarter 2017 earnings guidance (of $1.37 versus the prior estimate of $1.45), we believe that long-term investors will focus on the positive commentary surrounding incremental cost-cut potential. Key to that will be the timing of its pending merger with Dow Chemical (DOW), which DuPont now expects will happen in first-half 2017.

We are downgrading to Neutral from Buy and reducing our fair value estimate to $27 from $36. Mattel's turnaround story has lost momentum as it pushed up its fourthquarter earnings release and last night revealed disappointing year-end results.
Multiple factors contributed to the performance, including a slower-thanexpected retail environment, fewer product reorders, and increased promotional activity. Furthermore, several issues will continue into 2017 (and beyond), such as foreign-exchange head winds, rising input costs, and an unfavorable product mix. As such, the ability to exceed a 15% operating margin is now pushed out into 2019.

7-Mar-18,49.93,49.995,49.27,49.6,2673610,HSBC,"Standard Chartered PLC has a new market in its sights after 150 years financing trade across Asia, India and Africa: the U.S.
The London-based bank may be best known in the U.S. for regulatory run-ins over transactions with customers in Iran and other sanctioned countries . But its new head of corporate and institutional banking, Simon Cooper, wants to win business from U.S. companies looking to expand in Asia, Africa and other emerging markets where Standard Chartered is a major operator.
The country has ""many, many clients we've just never spoken to before,"" Mr. Cooper said in a recent interview. Last year, he and his management team met dozens of customers to find out how they felt about the bank. The broader Americas region has been ""underrepresented"" within Standard Chartered, Mr. Cooper said.
In October, it hired Torry Berntsen as chief executive and head of corporate and institutional banking for the Americas region, with a mandate to hire some more people there, Mr. Cooper said.
Recent wins include helping a big American coffee chain in China convert yuan back to dollars, and guiding a U.S. e-commerce business into Africa.
Right now, the Americas is Standard Chartered's smallest revenue-producer in a geographic breakdown. Loans to clients in the Americas were around $11.5 billion at the bank at the end of 2015. In the greater China region including Hong Kong, they were $77.7 billion.
The move to tap more mature markets--Mr. Cooper said border-crossing European companies also represent a big opportunity--comes as Standard Chartered is reducing risk in some racier parts of the world. The bank lent billions of dollars to entrepreneurs and businesses in India and Hong Kong, then paid the price when some of the
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 208 of 1177
businesses teetered in the commodities slowdown. Since the end of 2014, its commodities exposure has been cut by one third, to $37 billion at the end of June 2016.
Mr. Cooper was hired by Chief Executive Bill Winters last April to help get Standard Chartered back on track after years of overexpansion. He inherited a division that had grown too far too fast, fueled by cheap money pouring into Asia and relationships with a handful of large but risky customers. But cutting loose big clients has meant losing revenue too, something analysts say Standard Chartered can ill afford to do.
Standard Chartered runs the risk of being too concentrated in certain regions, said Chirantan Barua, a banking analyst at Bernstein Research. Expanding the focus on clients in the U.S. and other developed markets is ""a diversification strategy that makes a lot of sense,"" he said, that will enable the bank to bring developed players to emerging markets and not just other way around.
Mr. Cooper, 49, joined the bank after a 26-year career at larger rival HSBC Holdings PLC. There, he gained a reputation for being ambitious, decisive and blunt. From a start in corporate finance, he took a traditional path for rising HSBC managers with assignments across Asia and the Middle East. He was named a group general manager--an elite ranking within the bank--and was CEO of HSBC's Middle East and Korean arms before becoming head of global commercial banking in 2013.
He was then just one rung from the top job, held since 2011 by Stuart Gulliver. So his surprise jump to Standard Chartered was seen as an acknowledgment of the stiff competition to replace Mr. Gulliver when he steps down in the next year or two.
Now in a similar spot at Standard Chartered, and running its biggest business, Mr. Cooper is seen as a potential candidate to succeed Mr. Winters--although internal competition exists there too.
The bank also still has a series of legal and regulatory hurdles to get over, including a potential penalty from the U.S. for alleged business with customers in sanctioned countries beyond an earlier period covered by a 2012 settlement. Standard Chartered has said it is cooperating with a probe into possible historical violations.
The bank reports fourth-quarter earnings Feb. 24. Analysts say it could take years for Standard Chartered to get its returns back to acceptable levels while it cut costs and works through its problem loans. Its stock has been buoyed, though, by investors buying it as a proxy for commodities or as a hedge against the pound. Most of the bank's earnings are denominated in dollars, while its shares trade in sterling.
""We need to focus on growing revenues for this business and improving returns for our shareholders and that's the focus for this year,"" Mr. Cooper said. ""But they have to be sustainable returns. We've got to mitigate and manage the risks for both credit and financial crime as we grow.""

7-Mar-18,50.32,50.39,49.6,49.63,1902706,HSBC,"Major currencies are posting their largest swings in months, highlighting a growing difficulty for investors and traders to discern the likely path of Trump administration policy.
The U.S. currency rallied in the weeks following Donald Trump's election Nov. 8, reflecting in part investor expectations that deregulatory, tax-reduction and stimulus plans will push up U.S. growth.
But since the New Year, the dollar has declined and volatility has picked up, driven by statements by administration officials that have been interpreted by investors as advocating a lower dollar.
The remarks, from Mr. Trump and some important advisers, have surprised some investors and pushed many traders to take a more-defensive stance. Few analysts expect quick clarity on Washington policies that could settle the dollar's path, likely meaning more unpredictable trading in the months ahead.
""What markets are concerned about now is volatility,"" said Mark McCormick, head of North American FX strategy at TD Securities. ""People are staying in trades for shorter periods of time, and they're not taking as much risk.""
This week, a measure of volatility in the Japanese yen hit its highest level against the dollar since August, while volatility in the euro has recently touched its highest since July, according to Thomson Reuters.
The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, which gauges the value of the dollar against a basket of six currencies, notched daily moves of 0.5% or greater nine times in January, compared with four such moves in October. The index last month posted its largest decline since March 2016. It is down about 2.4% for 2017.
In part, the moves reflect hints, though far from definitive signals, that the administration supports a weaker currency--a stance that many economists say would conflict with policies the administration has backed that would tend to boost the dollar.
Other factors likely sowing doubt in markets include expected battles between the White House and congressional Republicans, who hold the majority on Capitol Hill, over taxes and spending. Fiscally conservative lawmakers could help stymie Mr. Trump's infrastructure plans. There is also a fight over border taxes, a policy that could further enhance the dollar's strength.
President Trump, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal last month, said the dollar was too strong compared with China's currency. Peter Navarro, head of the National Trade Council, in an interview with the Financial Times, accused Germany of exploiting the euro for competitive trade gains. The president has vowed to label China a currency manipulator, a step some economists say likely precedes new import tariffs.
While Mr. Trump seems to want a weaker dollar against some trade partner currencies, most economists agree that his economic platform could put strong upward pressure on the greenback.
""U.S. President Trump's rhetoric has been a key factor"" behind recent dollar weakness, said David Bloom, a currency strategist in HSBC Holdings PLC's Global Research department. But any administration desire for a weaker dollar ""will likely be undone by his policy mix,"" which is likely to push the dollar higher, he said.
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 211 of 1177
It is hard to know whether the new administration will explicitly pursue a weaker currency, in part because its economic team still isn't in place.
Traditionally, the top spokesman in Washington on the currency is the Treasury secretary, and Mr. Trump's pick, Steven Mnuchin, hasn't been confirmed yet. In confirmation hearings, Mr. Mnuchin suggested the Trump administration would remain committed to a strong dollar over the longer term, though he acknowledged a strong dollar would harm the U.S. in the short term.
There is confusion outside the White House about whose economic views will have predominance among officials with disparate opinions.
""It doesn't seem like they have sorted out amongst themselves who's going to deliver the message and what the message is on the dollar,"" said Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former top U.S. Treasury official in the Obama administration.
The dollar's twists and turns against the yen in the past two days show how sensitive markets have become.
During U.S. trading hours Tuesday, the greenback almost fell below ¥112, hitting its lowest level in two months, after Mr. Trump accused Japan and China of persistently keeping their currencies weak.
The dollar recovered against the yen Wednesday, closing up 0.4% in U.S. trading at ¥113.252. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe hit back, saying the country's economic policy was aimed solely at raising domestic inflation, and that U.S. criticism ""about inducing a cheaper yen misses the mark.""
Mr. Trump isn't alone in saying one thing while pursuing policies that may have an opposite effect.
Japan's continuing experiment with extreme economic policies, instigated by Prime Minister Abe after his election in 2012 in a program nicknamed Abenomics, has implicitly favored a weaker yen. The hope is that will boost exporters' earnings, encouraging them to raise wages, in turn boosting inflation.
Ultimately, the jawboning by leaders will likely be overwhelmed by the force of economic fundamentals, analysts say.
While the Federal Reserve is expected to keep raising interest rates this year, major central banks from Europe to Japan will likely keep their rates ultralow to help their sluggish economies. That divergence should lead to a stronger dollar because higher rates tend to make a currency more appealing to investors seeking yield.
""Currencies are not driven by just the government,"" said Nizam Idris, head of strategy for fixed income and currencies at Macquarie Bank Ltd. in Singapore. ""The market will become numb to this eventually.""

7-Mar-18,50.46,50.68,50.15,50.16,2137296,HSBC,"BEIJING--A private gauge of Chinese manufacturing activity fell in January, suggesting a loss of economic momentum in the world's second-largest economy.
The data and news of a tightening in short-term interest rates helped send markets down by more than half a percent as trading opened after the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday.
The Caixin China manufacturing purchasing managers index remained above the 50 mark separating expansion from contraction for the seventh straight month but declined to 51 in January from 51.9 in December, Caixin Media Co. and research firm Markit said Friday. Subindexes measuring output, new orders, employment and inventory all weakened last month, while the export-orders subindex rose.
On Wednesday, China's statistics agency reported that the official manufacturing PMI edged down to 51.3 in January from 51.4 in December. The official PMI tends to better reflect conditions among larger state-owned companies, while the Caixin index more closely tracks smaller private companies, economists say.
""When growth momentum weakens, we can see the Caixin number drop more quickly than the official PMI,"" said HSBC Corp. economist Ma Xiaoping. ""In the next few months, we'll likely see overall momentum moderate, although it will be gradual.""
China's economy is starting to lose steam as Beijing takes a more prudent approach on monetary policy and tightens property-market restrictions to stem speculative bubbles, economists said. China's central bank raised interest rates by .10 percentage point in its open-market operations Friday on seven-day, 14-day and 28-day instruments.
""The current growth momentum may be hard to sustain,"" said CEBM Group economist Zhengsheng Zhong in a note accompanying the release of the Caixin data. ""We must remain wary of downward pressures on the economy this year.""
But economists said any slowdown in growth is likely to be gradual, given Beijing's focus on economic and political stability in advance of an important Communist Party meeting in the autumn. They also cautioned against reading too much into a single month's data. The Caixin index tends to be more volatile than the official measure, and the Lunar New Year holiday, which started on Jan. 27 this year, often skews results as factories shut down and workers head home to celebrate.
While markets may not like the impact of tightening, which tends to push down property, commodity and other asset prices, it is a healthy development, some economists said. In recent months, speculators have driven up raw- material prices, putting pressure on factory profits, and a moderate tightening could reverse that trend.
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 214 of 1177
""Over the past few quarters, coal and steel prices have gone crazy on a lot of speculation, even though oversupply is still there,"" said Commerzbank AG economist Zhou Hao. ""The big picture will be about bubble deflation this year.""
Industrial profits in December rose 2.3% year on year in December compared with a 14.5% increase in November. Mr. Zhou added that a bigger challenge facing China's manufacturing sector is the need to reassess technology, efficiency, cost and its role in the global supply chain. ""President Trump wants 'Made in America,' Germany wants 'Made in Germany,'"" he said. ""China has to figure out where it stands.""

Peru's central bank is expected to keep its reference interest rate on hold at 4.25% when it meets Thursday, Credicorp Capital says.

It also will look at the recent appreciation of the sol against the U.S. dollar, and expected weaker economic growth in December, when business confidence indicators also moderated.

Bank of Japan May Find Itself With a Dilemma
As the Bank of Japan stepped up efforts to arrest increasing government bond yields, a weaker yen as a result of the central bank's accommodative stance may rekindle U.S.-protectionist talk ahead of Friday's Trump/Abe meeting in Washington. The yen weakened Friday after the BOJ decided to ultimately buy JGBs at a fixed rate, and a Japanese brokerage house analyst says the central bank had to ""cope with the ongoing spike in the JGB yields."" But for Japanese authorities already hearing Trump comments suggesting Japan was benefiting from a weaker yen, a dollar at current levels around ¥112 to ¥113 would be easier for them to explain central-bank action isn't aimed at a weaker currency, the analyst adds.

The Bank of Japan has effectively begun to raise its target for 10-year government bond yields, says Nikko SMBC chief economist Junichi Makino. On Friday, the central bank conducted fixed-rate 10-year-debt purchases at a 0.11% yield. ""They should have set the purchase rate at 0%, but they set it"" well above that. Doing so ""was a de facto rate increase."" His interpretation, while not necessarily shared in the market, adds to signs of skepticism among investors about the BOJ's resolve to hold down long-term rates. The 10-year yield is at 0.095%.

RBI Seen Cutting Rates This Week, Followed by Extended Pause
The Reserve Bank of India will lower its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point Wednesday given inflation is expected to undershoot the 5% target for March 2017, says Naresh Takkar, chief executive of ratings firm ICRA, a unit of Moody's. However, after the rate cut, an extended pause is likely, as focus shifts to the year-later 4% inflation target. ""With greater emphasis being laid on achieving the midpoint of the inflation target range of 4.0%, we continue to expect the anticipated rate cut in February 2017 to be followed by an extended pause,"" he says.

Economists to Look for Clarity on RBI's Inflation Aim
Beyond the rate decision, economists will be watching the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy review Wednesday to know by when it hopes to see inflation come down to 4%. The central bank had previously set a March 2018 date. But its most recent policy statement didn't make any mention of the target, giving rise to questions if the target was being relaxed to favor growth. ""It may be a good idea for the central bank to provide some color on when it intends to get to the 4% inflation target,"" HSBC says. If the clarification doesn't come, HSBC says it assumes the RBI would aim for a 4% to 5% inflation range, and return to the 4% aim only when investments show surer signs of a revival.

for monetary easing is steadily shrinking, says DBS. Economist Radhika Rao says weak economic activity, global uncertainties and the fact that headline inflation stays below the central bank's target all support a rate cut. However, core inflation still is sticky. India's latest purchasing managers index readings also show a recovery in activity levels. ""Regardless of when the rate cut materializes in [the first half of 2017], it is clear that the central bank is nearing the end of the monetary easing cycle as pent-up demand and easing cash shortage lift [fiscal year 2018] growth,"" she says. ""Oil prices are also a risk, as are firm U.S. rates,"" and are likely to keep the RBI from easing aggressively, she adds.

Economists Lower Outlook for Brazil Inflation in 2017
Economists again lowered their outlook for Brazil's inflation this year, according to a weekly central-bank survey. Brazil's inflation rate, as measured by the official consumer-price index, is expected to end 2017 at 4.64%, according to the survey of 100 economists, compared with the 4.70% forecast in the previous week's survey. It was the fifth consecutive reduction. Economists maintained their inflation forecast for 2018 at 4.50%. The Selic rate is forecast to end 2017 at 9.50% and 2018 at 9%, unchanged from the prior week's projections. Last month, the central bank cut the Selic rate to 13% from 13.75%, beating analysts' expectations for a half-percentage-point reduction. The country's economic growth forecast for 2017 was reduced to 0.49% from 0.50% a week ago. For 2018, the economists expect GDP to expand 2.25%, up from 2.20% previously.

7-Mar-18,50.96,51.26,50.93,51.23,1392970,HSBC,"LONDON--Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC on Friday said it agreed to buy baby-food maker Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. for $16.6 billion, a deal that will almost double the size of the British company's consumer-health business and push it deeper into emerging markets.
Reckitt, whose lineup includes Durex condoms and Scholl foot-care products, earlier this month disclosed that it was in talks with Mead after The Wall Street Journal reported on the potential deal. It will pay $90 a share in cash for the Glenview, Ill.-based company, which makes a range of nutritional products including Enfamil infant formula and the Sustagen milk supplement for children.
Including debt, the deal is valued at $17.9 billion.
The acquisition caps a yearslong search by Chief Executive Rakesh Kapoor, who lost out to Bayer AG in a bidding war for Merck &Co.'s consumer business in 2014 and has since been seeking a major acquisition.
Reckitt's growth has slowed lately, leaving the Slough, England-based company in need of a way to jump-start sales. On Friday, the company, which also has household-cleaning, personal-hygiene and food businesses,
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 219 of 1177
reported organic revenue growth of just 3% for 2016. The measure, which excludes currency effects and acquisitions and divestments, was the weakest in over a decade.
Sales have suffered from a string of issues, including a failed foot-care innovation, a scandal in South Korea that led to a Reckitt product being withdrawn and the disruption of consumer spending in India after some high-value bills were taken out of circulation.
Shares rose in early trading in London but finished down nearly 3%. Reckitt on Friday forecast 2017 organic revenue growth of 3%, which is below analyst estimates.
Mr. Kapoor said Mead Johnson meshes well with Reckitt's consumer-health portfolio, as did its acquisition of condom and foot-care brands in the past. ""Our strategy is about healthier lives and homes,"" he said. ""Their mission is about enabling healthier lives from the very beginning.""
He identified child nutrition as a solid opportunity, saying the category's sales are projected to grow by 3% to 5% over the medium to long term.
Mead Johnson had net sales of $3.7 billion in 2016, down 8%. Half the company's sales came from Asia, with 17% coming from Latin America and the rest from North America and Europe.
The deal will turn China into Reckitt's second-biggest market, increasing its emerging-markets footprint by two- thirds. The deal will also significantly boost the company's exposure to the U.S., which remains its No. 1 market. Analysts have expressed skepticism about the deal's cost-saving possibilities, saying there are few obvious synergies beyond some distribution and head-office cuts. ""This deal does have elements of desperation about it,"" Exane BNP Paribas analyst Jeff Stent said following Reckitt's initial confirmation that it was in talks to buy Mead. ""Mead has zero overlap with Reckitt.""
Reckitt said the acquisition would boost per-share earnings by a double-digit percentage by the third year after closing, a projection Mr. Stent on Friday described as ""very conservative,"" likely tied to low savings and the high cost of funding the deal. Reckitt forecast cost savings of £200 million ($249.9 million).
Investor cheered the deal when it was first broached. They saw it raising Reckitt's exposure to faster-growing, higher-margin categories in the long term; plus, Mead's struggles of late made it a good time for an approach despite the pound's decline following Brexit.
Mead's shares have fallen sharply in the past two years as the company grappled with sluggish sales in its key Asia market, and they were down 2.7% this year before news of the deal broke. In Friday trading, they were ahead 5.5% at $87.60.
""I don't think you should read too much into the timing,"" Mr. Kapoor told journalists on a conference call, saying Reckitt had been looking at Mead and other companies ""for a number of years.""
Reckitt on Friday reported organic sales growth of 1% in Europe and North America last year, while emerging markets grew by more than 8%. Profit rose 5% to £1.83 billion.
Robey Warshaw, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank and HSBC advised Reckitt. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley advised Mead Johnson.

7-Mar-18,51.13,51.31,50.77,51.04,1844939,HSBC,"Central bankers in the Asia-Pacific region issued warnings over the potential for woes stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's economic policy.
New Zealand's central bank chief on Thursday warned of a possible inflation shock in the U.S. and much higher interest rates if Mr. Trump rolls out a program of protectionist policies . Graeme Wheeler, governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, said recent comments from the Trump administration calling for higher tariffs on imports from China and Mexico would only increase prices in the U.S. and force the U.S. Federal Reserve to clamp down through tighter policy.
""It would raise inflation rates in the U.S. The Federal Reserve would need to push harder against rising inflation,"" Mr. Wheeler said Thursday, after the bank kept its benchmark rate at a record low 1.75%. Sharply rising U.S. interest rates would also strengthen the U.S. dollar, he said.
In Tokyo, meanwhile, a Bank of Japan deputy governor on Thursday said the central bank should press ahead with its current stimulus measures, signaling his caution over Mr. Trump's possible policies.
""I believe it is of utmost importance at the current phase that the bank persistently pursue powerful monetary easing,"" Hiroshi Nakaso, one of Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda's two deputies, told business leaders.
Mr. Nakaso called attention to potential hits to Japan's economy from overseas--particularly the U.S.--in addition to other troubling signs, such as Japan's stubbornly low inflation.
India's central bank, meanwhile, unexpectedly left interest rates on hold Wednesday despite an economic slowdown, with Gov. Urjit Patel citing ""the continuing uncertainty...on a full rollout of U.S. macro policies, especially on the fiscal side, where we still await clarity.""
The men's comments echo rising concern about the impact of the new U.S. president's policies on the global economy. While early enthusiasm for Mr. Trump triggered a global rally in stocks and the dollar following his election and his promises of fiscal stimulus and deregulation, optimism started to wane as the president spoke more about trade.
Mr. Trump has said his administration will negotiate better trade deals with other countries by acting bilaterally, and has also threatened to levy tariffs on some imports. One of his first moves as president was to pull the U.S. out of a 12-nation trade pact that included New Zealand, Japan and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. ""Growing protectionism poses an acute risk for Asian economies,"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC. He especially singled out the region's ""trade dependent and highly leveraged economies like Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Thailand.""
The decision was yet another sign that a global lull in inflation that has lasted for almost a decade is ending. The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to accelerate the pace of its rate increases as unemployment recedes. Eurozone inflation in January neared the European Central Bank's target of below, but close to, 2% after undershooting it for years.
New Zealand's Mr. Wheeler said a substantial U.S. stimulus package could also compound any inflation risks that were rooted in trade protectionism. Mr. Trump recently has said China, Japan and Germany devalued their currencies at the expense of U.S. trade competitiveness.
""Given the mandate of the Federal Reserve, if there was a large fiscal stimulus in the U.S., then the Federal Reserve would certainly lean against it,"" Mr. Wheeler said.
The U.S. central bank has already indicated it is likely to raise interest rates multiple times this year and next, he
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 222 of 1177
added. ""It will be interesting to see as those [fiscal] plans become clearer what happens to longer-term [U.S.] interest rates,"" Mr. Wheeler said.
Mr. Wheeler, who will step down from his post in September, said protectionist policies would trigger retaliation against the U.S. and slow global growth.
The recent rise in global trade tensions already coincides with the slowest pace of merchandise trade growth world-wide in five years, Mr. Wheeler said.
Mr. Wheeler said caution was warranted due to ""numerous uncertainties...particularly in respect of the international outlook.""

7-Mar-18,52.32,52.93,52.18,52.18,1987459,HSBC,"President Donald Trump's meeting with Japan's prime minister on Friday could rile one of the most closely watched relationships in finance: the yen and the dollar.
After Mr. Trump's election in November, the dollar surged to a 10-month high against the Japanese currency, as investors bet the new administration would boost U.S. inflation and growth. The rally prompted trend-following investors such as hedge funds to pile in, wagering the yen would fall further.
But 2017 has disappointed dollar bulls, with the yen rising 3.3% and bearish-yen positions declining sharply in recent weeks, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. More recently, tension between the U.S. and Japan over currency and trade issues has risen, with Mr. Trump last week alleging the U.S. had sat back ""like a bunch of dummies"" as both Japan and China devalue their currencies.
While the meeting Friday may not produce any blockbuster developments, the obvious tension over currency valuations and Mr. Trump's penchant for market-moving remarks are forcing investors to pay close attention.
""In the near term, political risk is the biggest thing"" for the exchange rate, said Maoko Ishikawa, foreign-exchange strategist at J.P. Morgan in Tokyo.
The dollar gained 1.2% to ¥113.26 on Thursday.
Japan and the U.S. aren't the only nations jockeying over currency issues at a time of tepid global growth and increasing political attention to the terms of trade. On Thursday, New Zealand's central bank chief, Graeme Wheeler, said a decline in his country's exchange rate was needed to keep its growth balanced.
The current climate in foreign-exchange markets resembles a ""cold war,"" Joachim Fels, global economic adviser at fund manager Pimco, said in a note this week. He said actions taken by the European, Japanese and Chinese
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 224 of 1177
central banks in the last half of 2016 contributed to the depreciation of their currencies.
Wall Street lacks a clear consensus as to where the yen goes from here. HSBC thinks the dollar will rise as high as ¥125 by the middle of 2017, believing Mr. Trump can push through the tax cuts and fiscal spending he pledged in his campaign. The firm expects the dollar to fade later in the year.
Others believe there is little room for the dollar to appreciate against the yen after a multiyear rally in which the U.S.'s currency gained more than 30% against Japan's.
UBS Wealth Management expects the gap between Japanese and U.S. rates to shrink this year, as the Bank of Japan moves closer to unwind its stimulus policies. The group expects the dollar to trade at ¥105 by year-end. The efforts of countries around the world to devalue their way to prosperity has been a focus of Mr. Trump's economic comments, both before his election and since.
For Japan and the U.S., the situation is complicated by some contradictions between their words and actions.
Mr. Abe and other Japanese officials say their priority is stoking domestic inflation, which often has been below central bankers' targets during a yearslong span of subpar growth. But analysts say it is getting hard to argue that their policies don't look like currency intervention.
One of the BOJ's key policy shifts in recent years has been to tether the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond near zero. When the yield goes too high, the central bank tends to step in to buy government bonds.
Keeping the 10-year JGB yield low is becoming costlier with the Federal Reserve expected to raise interest rates multiple times this year. As U.S. rates rise, investors seeking better returns may sell Japanese bonds and buy Treasurys, driving yields on JGBs higher and forcing Japan's central bank to buy more bonds.
That, in turn, means the difference in yields between Treasurys and JGBs could widen, putting downward pressure on the yen.
That scenario played out on Feb. 3, when the Japanese central bank was forced to boost its bond purchases by more than $6 billion after the 10-year yield spiked to a year-high of 0.150%.
Though the action plays out in government-bond markets, the policy also has the effect of weakening the yen. ""From the outside, it looks like they're manipulating the currency,"" said J.P. Morgan's Ms. Ishikawa.
There are conflicting forces for the U.S., too. Recent comments from Mr. Trump and other members of his administration suggest they don't want the dollar to get too strong.
Yet economists say Mr. Trump's plans for corporate-tax cuts and higher fiscal spending could drive U.S. inflation higher, forcing the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly. In turn, that would put upward pressure on the dollar against all currencies, including the yen.
Mr. Trump's attitude to trade is another key factor. Talk of a new border tax on imports is dollar-positive, for example, as it would likely crimp imports by U.S. companies, thus curbing their demand for foreign currencies. Adding to the confusion is a lack of clarity over the timing and extent of any trade measures by the Trump administration--and how other countries will respond.

8-Mar-18,51.83,52.13,51.54,52.02,3009266,HSBC,"French government bonds are selling off on worries that a possible Marine Le Pen win in national elections could lead France to pull out of the euro, but investors in other markets seem less concerned.
The gap between German and French government bond yields climbed to a four-year high this week , but French corporate credit and equity markets have stayed mainly calm this year, while the euro has appreciated against the dollar.
The disconnect suggests either fears in the government bond market are overblown, or that credit and equity investors have a long way to catch up if investors start to sense Ms. Le Pen could pull off another populist upset in one of the world's biggest economies.
Most analysts, investors and polls predict that Ms. Le Pen--leader of France's anti-immigrant, anti-European National Front party--won't win in spring elections.
""There's clearly political risk ahead in France, and the French [equity] market doesn't necessarily look priced for it,"" said Karen Olney, European equity strategist at UBS. Italian equities were cheap ahead of the country's December referendum on constitutional reform, but the French market still trades in line with the rest of Europe, she said.
The VSTOXX index of eurozone equity volatility, known as Europe's ""fear gauge,"" has picked up slightly this week to a level of around 18, but remains well below its high of 35.5 last June at the time of the British referendum to leave the European Union. France's benchmark CAC-40 stock index is up 1.5% so far this month, better than the 1.2% gain in the Euro Stoxx 50 index of blue chip European stocks.
Corporate bonds prices are steady too, with yields for domestically focused firms moving largely in sync with their international peers. French companies most exposed to a local economic shock like France leaving the euro are those reliant on the domestic market for much of their revenue.
Bouygues SA, the French conglomerate whose activities span construction and telecoms, and supermarket operator Carrefour SA make 62% and 47% of their revenue in France respectively, according to FactSet. Yields on bonds maturing in 2020 issued by each company have risen by 0.24 and 0.2 of a percentage point respectively in the past six months.
That is little different to similar bonds from international French companies like liquor supplier Pernod Ricard SA and health-care company Sanofi SA, which make less than 10% of their revenue in France.
Sentiment in corporate-credit markets across Europe appears relaxed, unlike during the 2010 to 2012 eurozone sovereign-debt crisis, when concerns that Greece's troubles would undermine the single currency sparked a steep selloff in credit.
Anglo-Dutch consumer giant Unilever sold a euro-denominated bond on Wednesday that was priced with a yield lower than French government debt of a similar duration.
Corporate bonds were similarly priced during the sovereign-debt crisis, when bonds issued by large energy and utilities firms yielded less than their governments.
""The disconnect between [government bonds] and credit means there is room for French credit to widen, even
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 227 of 1177
before allowing for the likely pre-election nervousness,"" HSBC said in a research note.
Some investors believe that the corporate credit market may have some catching up to with the government bond market.
""If you're a foreign owner and you just want to avoid the blowups this year, what's the point of running political risk?"" said Chris Telfer, a credit portfolio manager at ECM Asset Management.
""Everyone you speak to is certain that Le Pen won't actually get there, but people are once bitten twice shy,"" he said, referring to Britain's surprise vote to leave the EU and the election of Donald Trump as U.S. President last November.
In currency markets, the euro is up 1.2% against the dollar so far this year, suggesting the common currency isn't priced for a major political upset.
""People aren't really worried by a short or even medium-run risk of a euro breakup, that is definitely not on the agenda,"" said Bastien Drut, strategist at Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager.
There are some signs of uncertainty, however. Three-month risk reversal skews--a trading strategy used to hedge currency risk--for the euro-dollar pair fell to minus 2.2% Wednesday, suggesting some investors are protecting themselves against a fall in the common currency.
These indications of stress are still small compared with currency concerns before Brexit, where three-month risk reversals for the sterling-dollar rate plunged to below minus 6%.
Brexit and the U.S. election also taught investors to be wary of polls. Opinion polls regularly indicate that Ms. Le Pen will lose in the second round of the vote, but burned by the aftermath of the U.S. and U.K. votes, some investors are skeptical about the accuracy of polling.
Their concerns are being reflected in the government bond market.
""We've had two votes, Brexit and the U.S. election, which have shown there should be a significant risk premium,"" said Antoine Bouvet, European rates strategist at Mizuho International.
""The tools we have to measure the outcomes are imperfect at best, and that is enough to keep away some investors,"" he added.

1-Mar-18,53.86,53.88,53.249,53.75,2080080,HSBC,"A Republican tax plan has analysts predicting seismic shifts in global markets, from a double-digit surge in U.S. oil prices to the strongest dollar since the 1980s. But so far, few investors are willing to bet on it.
Markets are struggling to size up the far-reaching impact of the so-called border adjustment, which would tax imports at a rate of 20% while exempting exports. The aim is to make the U.S. a more attractive place for businesses to invest, while also raising $1 trillion to offset Republicans' proposed tax-cut plans.
Markets face big changes if the proposal becomes law. The dollar could rally by 25% to levels not seen since the 1980s, according to economists including Harvard University's Martin Feldstein. U.S. oil prices could surge to $65 a barrel from a recent $54, Goldman Sachs analysts project, reflecting a sharp tightening in the supply-demand balance in the U.S. market. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the personal-consumption- expenditures price index, could jump to 2.4% or higher from a recent 1.6%, by Goldman's estimate.
""The border tax is the biggest policy story in years,"" said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign-exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets.
Yet investors have been hesitant to bet on these moves, in part reflecting significant uncertainty over whether a border adjustment will become law or what form it might take. The proposal has faced criticism from both U.S. companies and politicians in recent weeks. Republican lawmaker Kevin Brady, one of the architects of the proposal, has said he is listening to objections and looking at ways to smooth the transition for taxpayers.
Goldman Sachs analysts said last month that pricing in global oil markets reflected just a 9% chance of the border
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 232 of 1177
adjustment becoming law.
President Donald Trump has expressed concern about the tax plan, calling it ""too complicated"" in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in January. The administration has since said a border adjustment is one option for paying for Mr. Trump's proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, but skepticism remains on Wall Street.
""The tax doesn't seem to be on the first round of the administration's priorities,"" said Alvise Marino, a foreign- exchange strategist at Credit Suisse.
On Thursday, Mr. Trump said he would make an announcement that would be ""phenomenal in terms of tax"" within the next three weeks.
Still, uncertainty over tax policy has weighed on the dollar, which has fallen 2% this year against a basket of major peers, relinquishing roughly half its postelection rally.
The border tax is expected to boost the dollar because U.S. companies, now exempt from taxes on their exports, would be able to sell more products abroad. When foreigners buy U.S. exports, they must buy the U.S. dollar and sell their local currency, driving the U.S. currency's value. At the same time, the tax could reduce U.S. appetite for foreign goods, which would curtail demand for foreign currencies and boost the dollar.
Advocates say the dollar would likely rise enough to offset the proposed tax, citing how currencies responded to similar tax systems abroad, so consumer prices would remain steady. For example: a 20% import tax on car parts made in Mexico would be met with a similar depreciation in the Mexican peso, so prices would remain stable for both importers and consumers.
But many analysts warn that these projections are based on economic theory. In the real world, the dollar likely wouldn't rise quickly or high enough to offset negative impacts.
Daragh Maher, head of U.S. foreign-exchange strategy for HSBC Holdings, said the value of the dollar and other foreign currencies is driven mostly by demand for assets such as stocks and bonds. Trade makes up only 1.4% of daily trading in the U.S. dollar, according to HSBC.
Analysts say some companies could choose to move jobs and production back to the U.S., as the import tax would temper the cost savings from outsourcing.
""These firms moved their operations to a place like Mexico because it was cheaper to build things there,"" said Mr. Marino. ""The tax is supposed to make these firms indifferent between using their Mexico facilities and making things in the U.S.""
A tax would be especially painful for emerging-market nations such as China, the U.S.'s biggest trading partner. In addition to diminished demand for its exports, the dollar's strength would add to downward pressure on the Chinese currency, the yuan.
Credit Suisse estimates that a border adjustment would reduce merchandise exports from Asia by 3% to 4%, denting the region's growth by around 0.5 percentage point.
""Less global trade, whether through a border tax adjustment or something else, is bad for Asia,"" said Eric Stein, co-
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 233 of 1177

director of global income at Eaton Vance.
A border adjustment would likely benefit Mr. Stein's bets against the Singapore dollar and Chinese yuan, as well as his positions in a type of Treasury bond that protects against U.S. inflation.
""Lots of the policies of the Trump administration are inflationary, and this is one of them,"" said Mr. Stein.
U.S. corporations that depend on imported products say the plan will force them to raise prices and lay off workers. A group of over 100 companies including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp., Nike Inc. and Gap Inc., launched a group called Americans for Affordable Products to lobby against the tax. The plan could also face challenges under World Trade Organization rules, analysts say.
In a statement, Nike said it plans to work with the Trump administration and with Congress ""to explore alternatives to meet the goal of growing the U.S. economy and employment without the complexity and negative impacts of a border adjustment tax.""
U.S. exporters, including Dow Chemical Co. and Lockheed Martin Co., have praised the plan, which would likely bolster their overseas sales. ""The border adjustment tax...will be, for us, a big positive,"" said Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveris on an earnings call.

1-Mar-18,52.33,53.3062,52.29,53.2,1806235,HSBC,"The voguish theme of ""reflation"" has driven a rally in car stocks over the past three months. But reflation has a dark side, too: rising raw-material prices. The Trump jump in share prices could be an exit opportunity for investors before the squeeze on profits becomes more apparent.
The extra costs necessary to research , design and equip cars with new gizmos, including electric powertrains, self-driving features and connections to the digital cloud have understandably garnered attention in recent months. A step-up in investments in autonomous technology was the key reason why General Motors missed analysts' forecasts for fourth-quarter profit last week.
But a more traditional form of inflation will also weigh on car makers' margins this year: higher input costs. An index of automotive commodity prices like steel and rubber compiled by UBS is currently 38% above its level a year ago. European car makers, for instance, will face between [euro]200 million ($212.63 million) and [euro]700 million in extra costs each, depending on their unit sales, notes Horst Schneider of HSBC.
GM and Mercedes-maker Daimler have both played down the scale of this problem in recent calls with analysts. GM said raw-material costs as they currently stand could trim its profit, all else being equal, by a figure in the ""low hundreds of millions of dollars"" this year, while Daimler's comments hinted at an impact of roughly [euro]200 million--just 1.4% of 2016 adjusted operating profit. Both companies gave outlook statements implying ongoing earnings growth, albeit at a modest rate.
The problem is that such projections look more dependent than in previous years on ongoing growth in vehicle sales. Input costs also rose rapidly in 2010 and 2011, following the financial crisis, but this coincided with a recovery in consumer demand in key markets such as the U.S., China and the U.K. Cutting costs and using up spare capacity in factories more than offset the burden of rising costs on margins. But now both U.S. sales and most car makers' operating margins are at record highs.
If demand remains buoyant in key car markets--and stock prices imply a surge in optimism about prospects in the U.S.--then manufacturers should eke out further profit growth. If it doesn't, however, profits would crater in a perfect storm of falling sales and ballooning product-development and unit-input costs. Heads investors win a bit; tails and they stand to lose a lot. On balance, this looks a good time to be selling car stocks.

15-Mar-18,51.63,51.8,51.475,51.68,1414235,HSBC,"French government bonds have steadily weakened ahead of the country's presidential election this spring, but French shares and corporate bonds have mainly held up. Panicked foreign investors may help explain why. Foreign-based investors own almost two thirds of the government-bond market but less than a third of French listed equity and nonfinancial corporate bonds.
That has raised questions over whether foreign investors are cooling on France and could back up recent evidence that investors are more sanguine about political risk in a country if they are in that country.
The chief risk in France is Marine Le Pen, the populist leader who wants to pull France out of the euro . She is gaining ground in polls, though she's still a distant second in a France's two-stage election. International investors fret about the possibility that Ms. Le Pen, the candidate for the far-right National Front party, will pull off a Brexit- style surprise and shock markets.
French debt maturing in 10 years now yields 0.7 percentage points more than the German equivalent. That spread has risen from as little as 0.21 percentage points last September and reached a four-year high last week.
French equity investors are confident that Ms. Le Pen will lose to a mainstream candidate, according to Socie?te? Ge?ne?rale. ""Foreign investors are less certain,"" the bank added in a recent research note.
While French sovereign yields have ratcheted higher against Germany's, French equities are trading in line with the rest of Europe.
The French CAC 40 has risen by 8.9% in the last six months, against an 8.2% rise for the broader Euro Stoxx index. Over 60% of French sovereign bonds are held abroad, but 28% of locally listed equity and investment fund shares are held overseas. according to the European Central Bank.
Data on Japanese holdings of foreign bonds may reflect that some foreign investors are saying au revoir. Japanese investors have been big buyers of French government debt in recent years. But in the final quarter of 2016 they bought ¥19 billion ($166.7 million), their lowest amount in a year and a half, and they began selling in the final two months of the year.
Foreign investors also hold less French corporate than government debt, owning 26% of bonds issued by nonfinancial companies.
Investors have been selling in that market. The spread between yields on the Bloomberg Barclays France Corporate bond index and the equivalent German index reached 0.35 percentage points last week, high by recent standards. But it has been much higher, a full percentage point in late 2012.
Likewise, daily trading volume in corporate bonds is 59% higher in February in comparison to the average over the last three years, according Trax, a subsidiary of trading platform MarketAxess. But the rise is sharper still in sovereign bonds, where volumes are up 82%.
There has been a recent pattern of locals being more relaxed about domestic political risks. In the immediate aftermath of the U.K's vote to leave the European Union . U.S.-domiciled funds investing in European equities recorded outflows of 9%, compared with 1.7% for funds domiciled in the region.
Analysts at HSBC believe that French corporate markets will catch up to sovereign bonds closer to the second voting round in May, but local biases will remain.
""We think investors are likely to react very differently to wider French spreads in April, based on their country of location, country of parent company and their own views of political outcomes,"" the bank said in a recent research note.

15-Mar-18,50.98,51.66,50.79,51.38,2054924,HSBC,"BEIJING--A private-sector data provider has quietly stopped publishing a widely watched barometer of China's property market that was one of the few alternatives to an official gauge, leaving a hole in a government- dominated flow of information on the Chinese economy.
Beijing-based Fang Holdings, China's largest online real-estate portal, has since at least 2010 published its compilation of home prices in 100 Chinese cities into a monthly index. The index usually shows sharper increases in China's runaway property prices than the official index, despite several interventions by Beijing to control property prices in recent years.
Fang has decided to stop updating the index online, to avoid disrupting the property market, Vincent Mo, Fang's chairman and chief executive, told The Wall Street Journal.
Home prices' frothy rise last year--especially in major cities such as Shenzhen, which saw spikes of up to 60%-- raised concerns that a leverage-fueled property boom could destabilize the financial system. That prompted a wave of home-purchase restrictions and tighter mortgage lending policies to rein in the market, which since the end of last year has started to stabilize.
Fang's home-price index showed prices rising at a faster pace than the official measure and was widely referred to in reports by analysts at international banks, including J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank.
Larry Hu, China economist at Macquarie Group, said he prefers to use the Fang index because it was published earlier in the month than official statistics and provides actual prices while the government gauge gives only the change in growth.
""I found the 100-city index much easier to use,"" Mr. Hu said.
In November, the latest month for which Fang's data was available, the average price for homes across 100 cities was 12,938 yuan ($1,879) a square meter, up 18.7% from a year earlier.
By comparison, government data showed that average home prices for the first 11 months of the year rose 10.8% compared with a year earlier. The National Bureau of Statistics said in its statement for November that home prices in first- and second-tier cities were stabilizing.
Mr. Mo said the government hadn't asked the company to stop publishing the home-price data online and that the decision was in line with ""zilu?,"" or the practice of self-discipline, which he said had prompted reflection about what actions best support the economy and Chinese society.
""As an influential research arm, I think it's good for us to see...a more stable development of the market,"" Mr. Mo said.
Investors and economists have long expressed skepticism about China's official statistics. As China's growth slowdown has deepened, Beijing has tried to exercise tighter control of the economic narrative, encouraging a less- gloomy outlook and what Communist Party officials have called ""positive energy.""
Last year, the Chinese government issued verbal warnings to economists, analysts and business reporters to brighten their outlooks on China's economy , according to officials and commentators with knowledge of the matter.
Fang isn't the first private indicator to change how it publishes. In June 2015, HSBC Holdings PLC ended its five- year sponsorship of China's purchasing-managers' index. A few months later, the new sponsor, Caixin Media Co., stopped publishing a gauge of the manufacturing industry, usually referred to as the ""flash PMI,"" that had provided
   PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 240 of 1177
an early read two weeks ahead of the official purchasing-managers index that analysts and economists had come to rely on.
A recent check of Fang's database software, China Real Estate Index System, showed the index hasn't been updated since November. Fang has continued to provide home-price data separately to clients, government agencies and business partners, Mr. Mo said.
Fang has been particularly useful for investors and watchers of China's housing market because it gathers a comprehensive vault of information, drilling down into sales turnover and square meters sold for specific city districts. Fang, which is publicly traded in New York, reported revenue of $250.1 million in the third quarter of last year, down nearly 13% from the previous quarter.
Mr. Mo said the housing market was volatile last year, leading to a sensitive period when Chinese media reports greatly influenced consumers and that some media outlets had focused on specific parts of Fang's housing data without providing context.
Mr. Mo said Fang expects to restart publishing the index online but didn't know when.
""Because of all the adjustments in the market, especially last year, we think it's probably better for everybody to be more careful,"" he said.

13-Mar-18,51.16,51.695,50.15,51.39,3197360,HSBC,"Mexico's national oil company Petro?leos Mexicanos issued [euro]4.25 billion ($4.49 billion) in bonds Tuesday, the largest euro-denominated emerging market corporate bond deal on record.
Emerging market investments have recovered from an initial slump after President Donald Trump's November election victory. Mexican assets in particular sold off after Mr. Trump's win , with the peso falling by as much as 16% against the dollar in the months after the result.
But the peso has rebounded somewhat, rising by 5.6% against the dollar in the last month. Other emerging market investments have also recovered from some of the Trump slump.
The deal is also a landmark for emerging market issuers in euro debt markets.
""The maturing European market is now able to offer deep funding, it's a bit of a coming of age,"" said Jean-Marc Mercier, global co-head of debt capital markets at HSBC, one of the banks acting as a bookrunner for Pemex.
The Pemex debt was issued across three tranches, maturing in 2021, 2024 and 2028. Yields on the bonds came in
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 242 of 1177
lower than expected, at 2.512%, 3.839% and 4.979% respectively, despite the company's financial struggles in recent years.
Tumbling oil prices and pension obligations led to an injection of capital by the Mexican government last year, and Pemex is already highly leveraged.
The company presented its five-year business plan in November, outlining its cost-cutting efforts and plans to reduce oil production below 2 million barrels a day for the first time since 1980.
But rising oil prices have been a boon to energy companies around the world. Yields on the last euro-denominated bond sold by Pemex, a three-year note issued in March last year, have tumbled. The debt initially offered a 3.75% yield, which declined markedly as 2016 went on. The bond yielded 1.34% on Monday.
""When they issue in euros, they're going to get a lower yield than they would in dollar paper,"" said Sailesh Lad, emerging debt portfolio manager at AXA Investment Managers. ""The euro market has always been very small for EM, but over the last 24 months or so we've seen an increase in euro paper.""
Mr. Lad said he hadn't participated in the Pemex deal, as the fund already owns dollar-denominated Pemex debt. ""We're quite comfortable with what we already hold,"" he added.
The euro-denominated market in emerging market debt is still small in comparison to the dollar market, but has grown considerably in recent years.
According to data provider Dealogic, 121 euro bonds were taken to market by emerging market issuers in 2016, more than at any point since the single currency began in 1999.
To be sure, not all investors were enamored with the investment opportunity offered by Pemex.
""We have a cautious view on the fundamentals, so we didn't participate,"" said Charles de Quinsonas, deputy fund manager of the M&G emerging markets bond fund. ""I don't think it's a bad company, but I don't think we're being compensated for the risk and reward at that price.""

13-Mar-18,51.47,52.2,51.47,51.74,2349713,HSBC,"HONG KONG--Investors in corporate bonds world-wide seemed to have missed the memo on President Donald Trump.
Despite warnings that Mr. Trump's economic agenda could be bad for global trade and growth--and hence company earnings--corporate debt has proved a popular investment class so far this year.
Nowhere is the trend more surprising than in Asia, where money has kept flowing into even the riskiest debt. The extra yield, or spread, investors demand for holding both investment-grade and high-yield Asian corporate debt versus risk-free U.S. Treasurys has narrowed since the U.S. election last November, and is heading toward its tightest levels since 2008, according to indexes published by Citigroup. Bond yields fall as their prices rise.
The strong demand has come despite analysts' warnings that Asian companies, particularly big exporters, could suffer under any new protectionist measures from the U.S. under Mr. Trump; and that the greenback's recent strength could hit Asian companies that have issued dollar-denominated debt while making most of their earnings in local currencies.
Much of the demand for Asian corporate debt is coming from local investors, who have a massive--and growing-- pool of cash they are keen to deploy, despite diminishing returns they earn for the risk they take on.
""We were cautiously optimistic on credit entering the year, but it has taken me by surprise, the strength of this rally,"" said Harsh Agarwal, head of Asia credit research at Deutsche Bank in Singapore. ""This wasn't anyone's base case when the year started.""
The trend echoes the U.S., where corporate-bond spreads are at their tightest in two years. There, investors have been scooping up debt as the outlook for U.S. companies brightens given the Trump administration's goals to slash taxes and regulation, and spend heavily on infrastructure.
In Europe, investors have also continued to pile into corporate credit in countries like Germany and France, despite the uncertainty created by key elections on the continent this year that has driven spreads wider in Italy and Spain. Appetite has remained high largely thanks to the European Central Bank's purchases of tens of billions of euros worth of corporate bonds.
For sure, macroeconomic concerns persist in Asia, particularly with the U.S. government's trade agenda yet to be defined in detail. Still, the International Monetary Fund reckons the region will see healthy economic growth of 6.4% this year.
To date, the vast majority of Asian companies have remained able to service their debts. The default rate on high- yield corporate bonds was lower in Asia than in the U.S. last year--at 1% versus 3.6%. The measure could rise but is forecast to remain low at 2% in Asia this year, compared with 2.5% in the U.S., according to HSBC Global Asset Management.
Moreover, with interest rates globally still low by historical standards, cash-rich investors are on the lookout for higher-yielding assets. Total household wealth is growing faster in Asia than elsewhere globally, up 4.5% in 2016 to $80 trillion, according to Credit Suisse.
""Clients are saying we have money to put to work--and we need to buy,"" said Deutsche Bank's Mr. Agarwal.
Bond issuers from risky sectors are taking advantage. Earlier this week, Road King Infrastructure Ltd., a Chinese property developer, raised $300 million from its issuance of U.S. dollar bonds at a coupon of 7.95%. The deal met such strong demand--more than $5.5 billion in orders--that it priced nearly 0.7 percentage point lower than the 8.625%-area in which it was marketed.
Asian investors ""tend to invest in what they know"" so their large pool of money--the so-called local bid--typically
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 247 of 1177
stays within the region, said Charles Chang, head of Asia credit strategy at BNP Paribas in Hong Kong.
Because this growing pool of money is chasing a shrinking pool of assets, spreads could continue to grind tighter. U.S. dollar debt issuance in Asia ex-Japan rose to $361.1 billion in 2016, up 8% from a year earlier, according to data from Dealogic. Yet many companies are also redeeming bonds, so net new issuance is falling: It could be around $40 billion-$60 billion in 2017, half the average amount since 2012 said Alfred Mui, head of Asian credit at HSBC Global Asset Management.
The problem with tightening spreads is that there aren't any particularly good outcomes.
Some market stress could emerge leading to a bond market selloff, but even if the Asian economy improves the upside for bond prices could be limited given how tight spreads have become already.
That view has led some investors in the region to look for better deals elsewhere.
""In [Latin America] and emerging Europe, they don't have that local bid that we have in Asia, so their spreads aren't that tight,"" said Jack Siu, Asia-Pacific investment strategist at Credit Suisse in Hong Kong. ""We do see more value in those regions.""

13-Mar-18,51.09,52.52,50.9702,52.35,3959482,HSBC,"Europe's economy is gaining strength, but its rallying stock markets may say as much about momentum in China. Shares of European companies with the tightest links to the Chinese economy have significantly outperformed their peers, helping the MSCI Europe index, a basket of stocks based in 15 European countries, rise more than 20% from its bottom in February 2016.
European stocks most closely correlated to the Chinese economy--such as mining companies and producers of
    PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 249 of 1177
capital goods like machinery and equipment--have fared 30% better than the overall market over the past year, according to an analysis by Deutsche Bank. Sectors with the most negative correlation to China--including telecoms, retail and pharmaceuticals--have performed the worst.
For decades European markets have followed Wall Street's lead, but China is becoming an increasingly big influence on the direction of local markets.
""It's been the year of the China trade,"" said Wolf von Rotberg, a strategist at Deutsche Bank.
To be sure, local shares have also benefited from improvements in both the European and U.S. economies.
The eurozone economy kept pace with that of the U.S. for the first time since 2008 last year while its jobless rate fell to a seven-year low.
The economy is expected to grow 1.6% this year, according to the European Commission, and a majority of fund managers surveyed by Bank of America expect European economic growth and inflation to pick up over the next year.
That has helped renew appetite for the region's equities despite concerns over the potential destabilizing effects of upcoming elections in France and the Netherlands.
But large parts of local stock markets are climbing higher on China's back.
European publicly traded companies collectively generate only 5%-6% of their revenue directly from mainland China, according to data provider FactSet. But China exerts a much bigger influence, through its massive impact on the global economic cycle, commodity prices, and broader appetite for risky assets.
That link was made clear in early 2016, when a meltdown in Chinese stocks and concerns about a falling yuan hit European shares hard. The Stoxx Europe 600 fell roughly 17% in the first six weeks of the trading year amid worries that the world's second-largest economy was on the brink of a downturn--more than twice the declines it posted in the immediate aftermath of Britain's vote to leave the European Union.
But China's economy appeared to stabilize after officials pumped it with cheap credit and state spending, pushing growth to 6.7% in 2016. China's producer-price index hit a five-year high in January 2017 after several slack years, while China's manufacturing sector has posted growth for six straight months . This has supported demand for European machinery and lifted economically sensitive parts of the region's stock market with it, analysts say. Sectors such as German industrials have done particularly well over the past year as a result of China's stimulus program, said Paul Markham, a director at Newton Investment Management.
""Europe is more of an economic follower,"" he said, requiring growth from areas such as China and the U.S. to drive its economy and stock markets higher.
Europe's mining sector, the region's best performer over the past year, has also been lifted by sharp gains in metals prices spurred by expectations for Chinese demand. Copper futures are up about 30% from a year ago and iron-ore futures have climbed to multiyear highs.
China accounts for more than half of global demand for most metals, according to S&P Global Ratings.
The U.K.'s FTSE 350 Mining index jumped 145% from its bottom a year ago, compared with a 32% rise in the broader FTSE 100.
Companies with big direct revenue exposure to mainland China have also outperformed . Luxury-goods maker LVMH Moe?t Hennessy Louis Vuitton, for instance, recently pointed to China as one reason its net profit jumped 14% in the second half of 2016. Its shares are up 31% from a year ago.
But because Europe is following China's lead on the way up, it is also exposed to downside should the country's growth waver.
While few expect a hard landing soon, recent data, including industrial profits and steel production, have suggested China's manufacturing sector may be cooling quicker than expected following last year's record stimulus. Analysts also point to a slowdown of new credit issuance relative to gross domestic product.
That isn't to say Europe isn't highly reliant on domestic and U.S. drivers as well.
Europe's beleaguered banking sector has also been a big driver of the recovery in European bourses, with lenders in the region up around 34% from a year ago, though the gains may have more to do with expectations for higher
 PDF GENERATED BY SEARCH.PROQUEST.COM Page 250 of 1177

U.S. interest rates and a stabilization of Italian banks than with China.
But even among European banks, China exerts influence. Shares of Standard Chartered, which derives roughly 43% of revenue from the Asia-Pacific region, nearly doubled in the last year while HSBC shares rose 68%. That compares with a 32% increase for Deutsche Bank shares and 21% for UBS, two banks with significantly smaller Asian revenue exposure.
""It's been a quiet one...but the Chinese effect has had more of an impact [on European stocks] than Trump,"" said Caroline Vincent, investment director at Cavendish Asset Management, referring to the boost Donald Trump's presidential election gave to many markets.

13-Mar-18,52.72,52.94,52.05,52.08,6806027,wells fargo,"A few years ago, CME Group Inc.'s main profit engine was stuck in low gear. Now, it is in overdrive. The futures exchange's biggest product line -- U.S. interest-rate contracts -- is enjoying record trading volumes as the Federal Reserve accelerates the pace of rate increases.From 2008 to 2015, the U.S. central bank kept short-term rates near zero, which limited trading activity in the contracts. Now with rates rising and inflation awakening, traders are jumping in and out of interest-rate futures as they speculate on the probability and timing of rate increases. On Wednesday, they will be scrutinizing minutes from the Fed's latest meeting for hints of its next move. That means Chicago-based CME can finally reap the benefits of the interest-rates empire it built a decade ago. The company merged in 2007 with its crosstown rival, the Chicago Board of Trade. The deal gave CME a near-monopoly in U.S. interest-rate futures, a position it has held despite attempts by rivals to grab market share.""If you want to trade anything in U.S. interest-rate futures, you're going to be trading on CME,"" said Christopher Harris, an analyst at Wells Fargo & Co.CME's position allows it to raise fees without losing customers, analysts say.In 2014, the firm pushed through its first big fee increase in five years, raising transaction fees for Treasury futures by 9% for its largest customers, alongside fee increases for energy, metals and other types of contracts.Since then it has bumped up fees for various interest-rate products each year, according to CME notices.The exchange operator also has rankled traders by introducing new fees for market-data usage.CME Chairman and Chief Executive Terry Duffy defended the moves on an April 27 phone call with analysts, saying the firm had long given away data for free and remained a ""low-cost provider"" compared with its competitors.Critics worry fees will keep rising. ""I don't see anything that would be a catalyst for fee reductions,"" said Neal Wolkoff, former chief executive of ELX Futures LP, a now-dormant exchange that challenged CME's grip on interest-rate futures. ""Usually, fee reductions come in the face of competition, and there just isn't any.""Adding to CME's dominance, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and other postcrisis rules encouraged trading to migrate from over-the-counter derivatives to futures, market observers say.In the OTC market, two companies trade with each other directly, instead of using an exchange.Research firm Tabb Group forecasts that 3.8 billion U.S. futures contracts will change hands in 2017, marking a fifth consecutive year of record volumes.Much of that growth will come from interest-rate futures, the volume of which is expected to increase 16% this year, a faster pace of growth than any other type of contract, Tabb says.Other CME products -- like energy and stock-market futures -- are better known to the general public.But interest-rate contracts have been the firm's biggest moneymaker for five of the past six years, responsible for around one-third of the revenue CME collects in trading and clearing fees.Several challengers have tried to create alternative venues for U.S. interest-rates futures trading, including NYSE Euronext Inc., the former parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, and ELX, which was backed by a group of Wall Street banks and trading firms. But those efforts failed to gain traction. Once a futures contract takes off, it is tough for competing exchanges to lure traders away from the primary exchange. Market participants tend to congregate in one place to trade, analysts say.",0
14-Mar-18,54.21,54.28,52.175,52.53,32656339,wells fargo,"Morgan Stanley will curtail its recruiting of veteran brokers, joining other big firms on Wall Street that are no longer willing to gorge on the pricey practice of paying top dollar to poach talent.The New York firm told brokerage managers Tuesday that it would ""significantly reduce experienced adviser recruiting"" to tamp down those costs, while spending more on supporting existing brokers and investments in new technology, according to a memo from wealth-management heads Shelley O'Connor and Andy Saperstein that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Morgan Stanley is the latest brokerage to say it wants to cut back its recruitment activities, which usually involved paying brokers six- or seven-figure signing bonuses, Wall Street's main mechanism of attracting brokers, assets and revenue.Such bonuses were structured as loans forgiven over as long as eight or nine years, with brokers initially getting paid up to 150% of the annual revenue they generated off fees and commissions. Such deals usually included back-end portions that brokers would earn after hitting certain asset and revenue targets over the life of the deal -- an arrangement that had become problematic under new retirement rules set to take effect next month since they could be perceived as a conflict of interest. Brokers who changed firms before the deal's term ended were usually forced to pay back a remaining portion.Executives had bemoaned the practice for years as costly and called it a ""zero-sum game"" among the four main brokerages -- Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, UBS Group AG and Wells Fargo & Co. -- as they routinely traded brokers with one another. Still, brokerage executives viewed it as a necessary pipeline for asset and revenue growth.The problem, recruiters say, is that brokerages were hesitant to pull back from recruiting if their rivals wouldn't. That was until UBS said last year that it would reduce by 40% the number of brokers it recruited annually.Following UBS's lead, Merrill this month told some executives that it would pause all recruiting after June 1 as it developed a new incentive package aimed at courting the industry's most valuable free agents, the Journal previously reported.Morgan Stanley will continue to honor recruitment agreements it has with brokers through June 16 and have a start date no later than Sept. 1, according to the memo to managers. In the meantime, Morgan Stanley is developing new recruiting policies that will be revealed in the coming weeks, the memo added.The money Morgan Stanley saves from its recruiting pullback will be funneled into a series of investments aimed at encouraging the firm's roughly 15,700 brokers to attract more client assets and revenue.",1
14-Mar-18,55.02,55.58,54.54,54.79,18997260,wells fargo,"Saudi Arabia's state-owned energy company has told J.P. Morgan, HSBC and Morgan Stanley they will be the lead underwriters for its planned initial public offering, set to be the largest ever, according to people familiar with the matter.
The three banks will lead the giant offering of about as much as 5% of Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Saudi Aramco, the people said.
The three banks declined to comment. A spokesperson for Aramco said the firm doesn't comment on rumor or speculation.
Analysts say the stake being offered could fetch as much at $100 billion to $150 billion and Saudi Arabian Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has estimated that the entire company is valued over $2 trillion .
Much of the money raised by the IPO would go to the country's sovereign-wealth fund , which would use it to diversify the kingdom's economy through investments. The Financial Times recently reported the three were favorites to win lead roles on the deal.
The IPO's massive size and its importance as part of Saudi Arabia's National Transformation Plan to modernize the kingdom's economy and wean it off oil has pushed banks to try to win a coveted underwriter role. That competition is expected to force underwriters to accept sharply lower fees, though they still stand to gain from a bonanza of fees because of the offering's magnitude.
Participation in a successful IPO also has longer-term implications for the banks by positioning them to win additional, future business as the Middle Eastern country continues to seek advice on reshaping its economy. Prince Mohammed has said the listing would occur in 2018. But complications restructuring Aramco and disentangling its finances from the government could delay the IPO until 2019 , The Wall Street Journal reported last week.
Aramco says it managed over 260 billion barrels of oil reserves for the Saudi kingdom and pumps almost 10 million barrels a day--far more than private-sector competitors such as Exxon Mobil Corp.
With the three main underwriters lined up, the next challenge will be to fill out the rest of the underwriting syndicate. Aramco and its advisers also need to select an exchange to list its shares following the new issue. Aramco is leaning toward listing its giant, state-run oil company on the New York, London or Toronto exchanges and has soured on the prospect of floating shares of the firm on an Asian stock exchange, people familiar with the matter said, The Wall Street Journal reported this week.

XPO Logistics Inc. Chief Executive Bradley Jacobs says the company is ""benefiting from the tailwinds of e- commerce."" The operator reported strong gains in profits and revenue for the fourth quarter, WSJ Logistics Report's Jennifer Smith writes, riding a surge in online shopping that drove demand for logistics businesses. The report, which included $27.3 million in net profits in the fourth quarter and $63.1 million in full-year earnings, marks a kind of watershed for the business: the profits came as overall gross revenue for the business doubled last year over 2015, capping an acquisition shopping spree that has built the company into a $14.6 billion operation. Many of the business units were disparate operations, but Mr. Jacobs says they've been combined to save costs and drive efficient delivery of services. E-commerce trends appear to be backing the combinations, with ""last-mile"" delivery fitting in with warehouse operations and increasingly profitable trucking services in the U.S. and Europe. DB Schenker is back in the market for more U.S. business, and that could lead to more consolidation in American logistics operations. Chief Executive Jochen Thewes tells WSJ Logistics Reports Brian Baskin the German operator, one of the world's largest logistics providers, remains a fairly small presence in a $700 billion-a-year U.S. freight market and expects to settle on an acquisition plan later this year . DB Schenker absorbed one big U.S. logistics operation with its acquisition of BAX Global in 2006, and it may look now toward operators with big domestic strength rather than international players. Switzerland-based competitor Kuehne + Nagel International AG made that sort of move in 2015 with its buy of freight broker ReTrans. But with more than $17 billion in annual gross revenue and the backing of parent Deutsche Bahn AG, the company likely has the backing to make any move its strategy demands.
The U.S. supply chain for organic grains increasingly begins overseas, and that's drawing complaints from American farmers. Supplies of organic corn and soybeans from countries including Turkey, Ukraine and Argentina are surging, the WSJ's Jacob Bunge reports, reflecting the growing appetite of U.S. consumers for organic products and the challenge U.S. companies face in meeting demand . U.S. organic-farming groups say the influx of foreign grain helped slash prices for organic corn by about 30% in 2016, but that the import business presents unfair competition. Some U.S. farmers contend overseas organic farms benefit from looser oversight, giving them an edge over domestic farms. They're seeking better tracking of grains throughout a supply chain where agricultural goods often go through commodities traders, and certification back to the source of the imports. E-COMMERCE
While Washington remains locked in a struggle over how to pay for roads, more states are arriving at a single solution: raise the gas tax. Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Haslam recently joined a parade of governors pressing for or signing fuel tax increases , the WSJ's Cameron McWhirter reports. Nearly 20 states, with both Republican and Democratic governors, have raised gas taxes or recalculated gas-tax formulas in recent years to generate funds for upgrades to aging roads and bridges. This legislative season, at least a dozen more are considering such measures, defying Republican Party barriers against tax increases amid frustration at decaying roads and depleted highway funds. Lawmakers in Washington are preparing to consider a plan to spend as much as $1 trillion on infrastructure, and some believe the state actions may make it politically easier for Congress to raise the federal fuels tax for the first time in 24 years.

14-Mar-18,56.99,57.17,55.87,55.9,37095026,wells fargo,"Wells Fargo & Co.'s board stripped eight top executives of 2016 cash bonuses and clawed back certain stock awards in response to the bank's sales-practices scandal.The San Francisco-based lender said Wednesday that the compensation cuts for current executives don't reflect the culpability of individuals but are meant to show their accountability for the bank's overall performance and reputational risk as a result of the scandal.Eight of Wells Fargo's executives, including current Chief Executive Officer Timothy Sloan and financial chief John Shrewsberry, are affected by the moves, resulting in a loss of total compensation of about $32 million.Mr. Sloan didn't become chief executive until October when former CEO John Stumpf abruptly retired following congressional grillings and a public uproar over the sales-practices scandal that also cost the bank a $185 million settlement.Before this, Mr. Sloan was the bank's president and chief operating officer.In addition to the bonus cut, the company also said it would claw back up to 50% of the compensation the executives would have received from certain shares granted in 2014.The shares, which were tied to the company's performance, are part of executives' long-term equity incentives.In 2015, Mr. Sloan received performance share awards valued at $6.5 million, according to the bank's most recent proxy statement.Wells Fargo's board in late September rescinded a total of about $60 million in pay from Mr. Stumpf and then-retail-bank head Carrie Tolstedt.Wells Fargo also said Wednesday in its annual securities filing that more customers may have been affected by the scandal than it initially disclosed. In its September settlement, the bank, regulators and a city official said up to 2.1 million accounts were opened using fictitious or unauthorized customer information.The bank didn't give further detail on how much higher that number could be. It added in the filing that this is unlikely to significantly affect customer refund costs.The board's investigation into the scandal is continuing, and the bank reiterated it is expected to be completed before its annual shareholder meeting expected in late April.While it is unusual for banks to withhold bonuses from top executives -- incentive compensation makes up the bulk of their pay -- it has become more common in recent years.",1
14-Mar-18,56.77,57.12,56.24,56.83,13277729,wells fargo,"Bank stocks reached their highest point in nearly 10 years on Wednesday, building on postelection gains that reflect hopes firms will soon shake free the shackles of stringent regulation, superlow interest rates and sluggish economic growth.The KBW Nasdaq Bank index, a measure of 24 of the biggest U.S. bank stocks, rose more than 3% to touch its highest level since late 2007. The gain, which followed President Donald Trump's address to Congress on Tuesday night, brought its rise since Nov. 8 to about 32%. The index has outperformed the S&P 500 by around 20 percentage points during this time.Among big banks, Bank of America has led the charge higher. It is up 50% since the election; on Wednesday the stock gained 3.6%.Investors aren't the only ones who believe the outlook for banks has changed drastically -- and for the better. Bank executives themselves are now looking to reinvest in their businesses rather than just hoping to return more capital to shareholders. That is a big change from recent years when executives were mostly in a defensive crouch.""We have the capacity to increase our balance sheet if the opportunity presents itself,"" Morgan Stanley finance chief Jonathan Pruzan told analysts earlier this year after the firm's fourth-quarter earnings report. ""That's certainly an opportunity that we haven't seen in the past.""Granted, banks' financial results haven't yet shown actual gains. Among the six biggest U.S. banks, for example, only J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. posted returns on equity for 2016 that exceeded the 10% level that investors generally consider to be a bank's cost of capital.Lighter regulation that allows banks to hold less capital could help to bolster those returns, though. And analysts are already forecasting increased profitability.Analysts' earnings-per-share expectations for 2018 for the six big banks have increased, on average, by about 11% from the end of October to the end of February.Reflecting this optimism, J.P. Morgan executives on Tuesday struck a bullish tone at the bank's annual investor day. And while the bank continues to focus on returning capital, Chief Executive James Dimon noted growth is a priority. ""The most important thing we do, bar none, is investing in our own businesses and the opportunities are everywhere to do better services, better profit-creating processes and more vision,"" he said.J.P. Morgan also said its balance sheet, which stood at $2.49 trillion at the end of last year, is likely to rise to about $2.6 trillion by the end of 2017.At Morgan Stanley, the balance sheet has shrunk to about $800 billion today from more than $1 trillion in 2007. The biggest cuts at the firm have come in its trading and banking divisions, whose share of total assets has fallen more than 18 percentage points over the past decade.Granted, if Mr. Pruzan wants to start growing the balance sheet, he will have to have capital. But that is one thing Morgan Stanley has plenty of: Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analysts estimate the firm is holding 10% more capital than it needs to pass the Federal Reserve's annual ""stress test,"" the highest proportion of any big bank.Mr. Pruzan isn't alone. Retained earnings at the six largest U.S. banks have doubled over the past five years and now make up 62% of combined total shareholders' equity, up from 44% in 2010.""For a few years, the story on capital was 'when can you return it?' but that's because there was no business opportunity to put it to use,"" UBS Group AG analyst Brennan Hawken said.Pivoting to growth mode will pose a test for bank executives. Large-scale acquisitions are still unlikely at firms labeled ""systemically important."" But there are other ways to invest.Banks could dangle incentives to lure new customer deposits, greenlight riskier trades, make more loans or buy ""smart"" ATMs in branches.One tantalizing opportunity is on trading desks, which have been slowly starved of capital in recent years. The value of financial instruments held by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., for example, has fallen by one-third since 2012, even as asset prices have risen. Smaller portfolios make it harder for traders to meet client demand; day to day, it means they say ""no"" more often than they once did.Speaking on his bank's earnings call last month, Goldman's current finance chief, Harvey Schwartz, talked of the choices that will face his successor, R. Martin Chavez, who will take over as chief financial officer in April.""If he has the chance to deploy capital back to our clients, not to return as much to shareholders, grow risk-weighted assets, those are the environments that we thrive in,"" Mr. Schwartz said. ""Ultimately, that's our preferred way to deploy capital.""At Citigroup Inc., CEO Michael Corbat said in January the bank was looking to invest in its core businesses. He singled out upgrading ""tired"" branches in Mexico and increasing its deposits and trading from hedge funds, a business that can weigh heavily on a bank's balance sheet.""It's things that we need to do,"" he said. ""We think we've got the ability not just to maintain but to grow share and to grow profitability.""",1

The move delays new rules known as ""gainful employment"" that formed a key piece of former President Barack Obama's higher-education agenda. It could ultimately help for-profit colleges avoid sanctions if they prove the government data underpinning the rules is flawed. The Education Department said Monday it will give schools until July 1 to file appeals, pushing back an original deadline of Friday. The rules are designed to cut off access to federal money for career-training programs if multiple classes of their graduates spend at least 20% of their discretionary income, as defined by a formula, or 8% of their total earnings each year, paying off student debt.

Wells Fargo sent a separate memo Tuesday to some employees alerting them that an independent consulting firm likely will contact several hundred employees about the sales-practices issues, according to the memo reviewed by the Journal. The consulting firm is reviewing the bank's controls around sales practices to try to determine the root cause of the issues. The bank is having this done as part of the regulatory consent orders it entered into in September. Meanwhile, the bank's board is continuing its own investigation into the scandal. It will share results before Wells Fargo's annual shareholder meeting April 25. In recent weeks, Ms. Mack has met with senior retail-banking executives and hinted at changes to the business that were detailed in Tuesday's memo, according to people who attended them. As part of these, two of the retail unit's top three employees, who were also lieutenants to former retail-bank head Carrie Tolstedt, had their roles diminished. Ms. Tolstedt retired in July; the bank's board subsequently clawed back some of her long-term compensation. Among the affected executives, Lisa Stevens will continue leading the retail bank's western region, which ranges from California to Iowa, but no longer will oversee small-business banking. She will continue to report to Ms. Mack. Before the scandal, many bank employees said they believed Ms. Stevens was in line to become head of retail banking. Chief Executive Timothy Sloan is one of her mentors, and executives said the two sometimes worked out together at employee events in Pasadena, Calif., near where they both live. John Sotoodeh, who took charge of the bank's troubled Los Angeles region in 2009, also was demoted. He now will oversee a region a fraction of the size of his prior role, which had included Texas, according to the memo. As a result, employees directly reporting to him will fall to an estimated 7,000 from 15,000 previously. Mr. Sotoodeh, who previously reported to Ms. Mack, now will report to Ms. Stevens. Mr. Sotoodeh was known within the bank for aggressively pushing sales, especially during Wells Fargo's ""Jump into January"" promotional event each year, and for promoting lofty goals that employees had to hit. Former employees have said that these goals prompted them to create fake accounts. Wells Fargo fired 5,300 employees over a five-year period for such behavior. Mr. Sotoodeh was also one of a group of top retail-bank executives who were warned about possible sales-practices issues as early as 2012. Former head of deposit products Ken Zimmerman, who reported to Ms. Tolstedt, wrote an email in June of that year to a number of retail-banking executives, including Mr. Sotoodeh, Ms. Stevens, Shelley Freeman and Claudia Russ Anderson. The latter two were fired by the bank a few weeks ago. The email cautioned about customers getting multiple checking accounts on the same day, an issue Wells Fargo had been looking into. ""This is something to keep an eye on,"" wrote Mr. Zimmerman, who took a leave of absence in early 2016 and left the company in July, according to a copy of the email reviewed by the Journal. ""The regional variation suggests bankers are likely driving some of this behavior"" and Wells Fargo may risk a ""customer perception that their money isn't safe."" The current and former executives didn't respond to requests for comment. Besides changing the roles of Ms. Stevens and Mr. Sotoodeh, Ms. Mack plans to name three executives to oversee new groups: one focusing on small business and the affluent, another on customer and branch experience, and a third on business strategy and administration, according to her memo. Earlier this week, the Journal reported that the bank also fired three retail-banking managers who led large regions in California and Arizona, around one level below the four executives who were earlier fired.",0
14-Mar-18,57.16,58.27,57,58.23,19051459,wells fargo,"Merrill Lynch's plan to potentially ease off its pledge to completely do away with commission-based retirement accounts may not provide relief to retirement clients who want to keep using Wall Street's traditional sales model. The Bank of America Corp.-owned unit told brokers that it is considering alternatives for clients in ""limited situations"" where individual retirement accounts that charge a fee based on a percentage of assets wouldn't be in their best interest, according to a memo from Merrill head Andy Sieg and viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Situations where fees charged to a retirement saver wouldn't be appropriate include accounts that have private-equity stakes or concentrated stock positions that aren't traded frequently, which would tend to include more sophisticated investors, people with knowledge of the situation said. The bulk of Merrill's retirement-paying commission savers are still expected to be steered toward fee-based accounts or Bank of America's online brokerage platform, Merrill Edge, people familiar said. The creation of an alternative product hinges on whether the Labor Department decides to delay its landmark retirement regulation, the people said. The fiduciary rule is set to take effect next month, but the Labor Department recently proposed pushing that date back to June 9 as it weighs whether to revise it. Merrill executives haven't made a final determination as to how clients would pay for the alternative product and what investments would be allowed to be bought and sold in it, the people added. Such a product would likely carry heavy restrictions on what could be bought and sold similar to those already imposed on commission-based IRAs. The restrictions on commission-based IRAs, which are meant to eliminate conflicts, include sales of mutual funds, nontraded real-estate investment trusts and life insurance products. The people familiar added that there is no guarantee an alternative product will be created. Merrill in October said it would no longer accept commissions in IRAs once the fiduciary rule, which requires brokers to put the interests of retirement savers ahead of their own, began to take effect. Merrill's decision to reconsider those plans is based on concerns voiced by its clients as well as some of its more than 14,500 brokers, the people said, stressing that those situations where fee-based arrangements wouldn't be considered appropriate would be limited. Merrill's biggest rivals didn't follow suit with the end of commission-based IRAs, with both Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co. saying they would use an exemption in the rule that permits brokerages to offer commission-based accounts to retirement savers. Michael Wong, an analyst at research firm Morningstar Inc. who focuses on the brokerage industry, said it makes sense Merrill is reconsidering its stance while the fiduciary rule is in limbo. The brokerage may have realized that certain situations, such as investors with concentrated stock positions, would have been hard to make a case for a transition from commissions to fees. ""If you can't justify the movement from a commission-based account to a fee-based account, that's a problem,"" Mr. Wong said.",1

Mr. Sloan received $2.33 million in base pay, with a bonus that included shares valued at $10.5 million. He, along with seven other executives, didn't receive a cash bonus this year compared to $1 million Mr. Sloan received for 2015 and the $4 million that his predecessor John Stumpf received in cash bonus that year. The lack of a cash bonus along with an up to 50% reduction in certain stock awards for 2016 were meant to reflect the $185 million fine the bank paid last fall for opening as many as 2.1 million accounts using fictitious or unauthorized customer information. Buyer Cuts Bid for Swiss Bank BSI The buyer of a Swiss bank caught up in corruption probes tied to Malaysia's state investment fund is seeking to cut the purchase price by about a quarter after the bank had nearly $5 billion in withdrawals in two months. BSI had 4.9 billion Swiss francs ($4.9 billion) in net asset outflows in the last two months of 2016, according to EFG International AG, the Zurich-based bank that announced its purchase of BSI last November. EFG International, which is buying BSI from Brazilian bank BTG Pactual SA, said it is seeking to pay 277.5 million francs less for BSI than the 1.06 billion franc purchase price disclosed in November. EFG had originally announced plans early last year to pay roughly 1.33 billion francs for BSI, when alleged ties between BSI employees and the corruption scandal at 1Malaysia Development Bhd., known as 1MDB, weren't clear. BTG said it ""refutes"" EFG's revised purchase price. REGULATION Spain Orders Banks To Join Operations A Spanish government-run fund told two state-owned Spanish banks to merge, an example of how countries such as Spain that bailed out failing lenders are still struggling to return those banks to private hands. Spain's bank-bailout fund, known as the Frob, on Wednesday instructed lenders Bankia SA and Banco Mare Nostrum SA to begin a merger process, after studies commissioned by the Frob revealed that a fusion would allow the Spanish state to recover the greatest amount of taxpayer funds. The Frob said the studies show that the Spanish state would bring in 401 million euros ($425.3 million) more through a merger of Bankia and BMN and subsequent stake sales than if the lenders were sold individually. As part of the studies, investment bank Societe Generale sounded out potential buyers for BMN and, according to the regulatory filing from the Frob, received only one expression of interest.",0
7-Mar-18,56.4,56.735,56.01,56.6,24788705,wells fargo,"Banks and other financial firms in 2016 generated the highest level of fees in seven years related to overdrafts on checking accounts, marking a turnaround for a charge that crisis-era regulation tried to rein in. Overdraft fees totaled $33.3 billion in 2016, up about 2.5% from 2015 and 5.4% from 2011, according to Moebs Services Inc., an economic-research firm. Overdrafts occur when consumers make transactions that are larger than their checking-account balance. Most banks will cover the shortfall, no matter how little in savings or assets the consumer has, in exchange for what is usually a hefty fee. The 2016 fees were the highest since 2009, the year before the Federal Reserve implemented a rule that stopped banks from automatically charging consumers overdraft fees on debit-card and automated-teller-machine transactions. Instead, the rule required banks to get permission from consumers before charging a fee for such transactions. Such fees can run as high as $45 a transaction, according to Moebs Services, though the median fee across banks and other financial institutions is $30. Banks opposed the rule, warning that overdraft-fee revenue would tumble since a smaller pool of consumers would face such charges. But after initially dropping, overdraft-fee revenue remained steady at just shy of $32 billion, before starting to pick up around mid-2015, according to Moebs data, and then the 2016 growth rate was the largest annual increase since 2009. Analysts said the revenue growth isn't unusual given that the overdraft rules have been in place for some time. It ""is likely tied to new-account growth the industry is experiencing,"" said Matthew Keating, senior equity research analyst at Barclays who covers midsize banks. Some consumer advocates, though, have criticized new bank strategies to get consumers to enroll in overdraft services. Those, they say, include wrongly presenting the service as mandatory for new customers or emphasizing scenarios in which the feature could help people who are tight on cash. A survey by the Pew Charitable Trusts, a proponent of overdraft regulation, found some 52% of consumers who have paid a debit-card overdraft fee don't recall opting in to this service. Banks ""have continuous exams with regulators, and any hint of wrongdoing is something that would be picked on very quickly,"" said David Pommerehn, associate general counsel and vice president at the Consumer Bankers Association. He added that limited availability of credit for subprime borrowers has contributed to the rise in overdraft-fee revenue. Consumers with low credit scores and little to no savings are using overdraft services as a short-term financing option. Overdraft-related fee revenue at the 10 largest U.S. retail banks by assets that report these data totaled about $7.5 billion in 2016, up 4% from a year before, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Both S&P Global and Moebs data also include additional fees such as when consumers bounce checks or arrange for bill payments larger than their checking-account balance. Those transactions aren't part of the Fed's opt-in requirement, which means that checking-account users can incur them without signing up for any specific service. The increase in these figures suggests these types of transactions might be up as well. One implication of the rising revenue is that consumers may be growing more comfortable spending more than they have, even if it comes at a cost. There were nearly 1.12 billion overdraft transactions in 2016, up from nearly 1.09 billion a year earlier and 1.07 billion in 2014, according to Moebs. Another possibility is that banks are getting many new and existing customers to opt-in to overdraft services, having stepped up campaigns in branches and online promoting the feature. More enrollment generally corresponds to a larger number of overdraft transactions, said Michael Moebs, economist and chief executive at Moebs Services. Some banks' growth rate was much higher than the industry average. Wells Fargo & Co., for example, posted a 9% increase to reach $1.78 billion in overdraft-related revenue in 2016. A bank spokeswoman said this was partly due to customer growth and increased transaction activity. Several large banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and U.S. Bancorp, said year-over-year revenue increases ranging from around 1.5% to 3% resulted from account growth as more people signed up for checking accounts. Overdraft revenue is also up at credit unions. It reached a record of $6.2 billion last year, according to Moebs Services. How to Avoid Overdraft Fees Consumers are incurring more fees for spending money they don't have in their checking accounts, but there are steps they can take to avoid these charges. Overdraft fee revenue hit a seven-year high in 2016 due in part to customers' financial missteps or their decisions to bounce checks or use debit cards to pay for purchases exceeding checking-account balances. Many overdraft fees can be avoided. The Federal Reserve implemented a rule that went into effect in 2010 requiring banks and other financial institutions to get consumers' permission before they start charging overdraft fees for debit-card and automated-teller-machine transactions. As a result, banks, credit unions and other institutions typically ask consumers signing up for new checking accounts if they want to opt in to debit-card overdraft protection. Some banks present it as a way to get extra cash in an emergency. Consumers should keep in mind that by signing up for this service, they are enabling debit-card transactions to go through that can bring their account balance below zero, even when the expense isn't absolutely necessary. The median fee for this service is $30, according to economic-research firm Moebs Services. That is a major reason why consumer advocates, including the National Consumer Law Center, urge consumers to just say no to opting in. Signing up for the overdraft service doesn't keep you locked in forever. Consumers who don't want to continue should tell their bank they want out -- a request financial institutions must honor. There are other ways to incur overdraft-related fees, however, even without opting in. For instance, customers in most cases must pay the fees if their checks bounce or if they arrange for bill payments that exceed their account balance. Account holders can take several steps to avoid overdrawing, including checking their balance at least once a day. Many banks can send consumers alerts via text message or email when their balance is running low. Banks also offer several alternatives to overdrafts. One option is linking their savings account to their checking account and transferring funds to the checking account when needed. Depending on the bank, this service may be free or cost around $10 to $13 per transfer.",1

The San Francisco-based bank said checking-account openings fell 43% year over year to about 300,000, while new credit-card applications fell 55% from a year earlier to about 200,000. The bank did continue to make progress in average consumer and small-business deposit balances, which rose 6% year over year to $761.4 billion. Credit-card purchase volume also increased. Customer-loyalty scores rose for the fourth consecutive month, to 57.6% but are still down from 62.1% a year earlier. Wells Fargo has been reporting monthly customer metrics since its scandal erupted in September. The bank's chief executive, Timothy Sloan, said it is part of its ""ongoing commitment to transparency."" The bank will provide its next update in April. Mary Mack, head of retail banking, added that it will take ""time for us to work through the changes we are making in our business."" Ms. Mack confirmed on a call with analysts Monday that the bank recently reorganized its retail-banking group, which The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month. She added that the bank will begin a new marketing campaign next month that highlights its offerings, following Wells Fargo's push to resume marketing in January. Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry responded to a question about the board's independent investigation of Wells Fargo, saying that he expects it will publish its findings in early to mid-April so that shareholders have time to review them before the bank's annual shareholder meeting April 25.",1
7-Mar-18,56.81,57.97,56.59,57.59,20560933,wells fargo,"The possibility of a U.S. tax-code overhaul is casting a shadow over the $10 billion affordable-housing industry, which receives tax credits so valuable they often determine whether or not projects get off the ground. Members of Congress and President Donald Trump have proposed reducing the corporate tax rate to 15% to 20% from the current 35%, dimming the allure of a credit investors such as big banks and insurance companies receive to offset income taxes. Affordable housing, which represents about one-quarter of all new apartment construction in the U.S., relies on the credit for capital. Developers said investors are valuing the credit 10% to 20% lower since Election Day. In some cases, investors have walked away, opening up funding gaps in projects already in motion. Because developers already walk a financial tightrope to build low-income housing, some projects are simply failing. Tax-credit values have collapsed, said Stuart Boesky, chief executive of Pembrook Capital Management LLC, a lender specializing in affordable housing. ""Some of the deals are just dying. Some of the deals are scrambling around looking for gap grants from state and local housing agencies."" The reduction in the credit's value already is likely to lead to $1 billion to $1.5 billion less equity investment in affordable housing this year, according to Novogradac & Co. LLP, an accounting firm. The tax-credit program was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1986, during the last major tax-code overhaul, to encourage more private investment in affordable housing and to move away from the traditional public-housing model. The program requires that developers set aside a certain portion of units for families making below the local-area median income and restricts the rents that they pay. In reality, most projects end up being almost entirely leased by low-income families. The value of the tax credit is two-pronged. The housing-credit program allows investors to take tax credits dollar for dollar against their federal taxes in exchange for providing funds to build affordable housing. The program offers additional value to investors because they can deduct the depreciation of the property and interest expenses. These deductions are most affected by the proposed changes. Investors are pulling back even though the timing of any tax overhaul is uncertain. Wells Fargo & Co., one of the country's largest investors in low-income housing, purchased $2.23 billion of credits in 2016. Bank executives expect that number to fall this year. Still, the tax credit has bipartisan support in Congress and is likely to survive a push to eliminate most deductions. Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington, is proposing legislation that would expand the credit by 50%, helping to offset the loss in value. The bill is co-sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah.",0
7-Mar-18,56.92,57.615,56.42,57.41,22428543,wells fargo,"Wells Fargo & Co. has admitted it has culture problems related to its sales-practices scandal. Now, it is turning to an academic for help. Chief Executive Timothy Sloan said at a company town hall Tuesday that the bank is aiming to survey all its roughly 269,000 employees about its culture, working with an academic who specializes in this area. The bank declined to name the academic, though the 20- to 30-minute survey will roll out in May. The bank declined to say when the survey will be completed, but Mr. Sloan said the analysis and proposed actions will be shared with senior executives. He added that ""high-level results"" will be shared with bank employees. ""Our goal is to uncover our culture's positive attributes and its potential weaknesses, so our leaders can understand how best to foster an ethical, inclusive, and customer-focused culture,"" Mr. Sloan said. The push comes at an opportune time. Earlier Tuesday, a regulator continued to jab Wells Fargo about its culture problems. Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley said in remarks prepared for a speech in London that the Wells Fargo sales-practices scandal is just one example of how banks have to improve their cultures. ""There was a serious mismatch between the values Wells Fargo espoused and the incentives that Wells Fargo employed,"" Mr. Dudley said in prepared remarks. He has been one of the most outspoken regulators on bank culture in recent years. Speaking at the bank's Orlando, Fla., event, Mr. Sloan echoed the criticism. ""This is why our operating committee and I agree on this important point: If there's one thing we must get right as we lead Wells Fargo forward, it is our culture,"" he said according to prepared remarks. Wells Fargo in September paid a $185 million fine over opening as many as 2.1 million accounts using fictitious or unauthorized customer information. It has since faced a barrage of public and political criticism and investigations. Mr. Sloan said the San Francisco bank used a different type of survey for seven years about how engaged its employees are, includinghow they score on a happy-to-grumpy ratio. Since the sales-practices scandal erupted in September, the bank has sent surveys to more than 110,000 employees about its culture, Mr. Sloan said. But it wants to dig deeper. This isn't the first time Mr. Sloan addressed the culture problems facing the bank. In a late-October company town hall, he admitted ""things that need to be fixed withinour culture. There are weaknesses within it that we must change."" He said that starts with understanding where things ""broke down, and where we failed -- as a culture, a company and as leaders."" Mr. Sloan then said Wells Fargo would hire outside independent ""culture experts"" to help it understand where its weaknesses are. The bank also has said the lofty retail-banking sales goals it has since done away with drove its culture. Those changes, along with restructuring how employees are compensated, will filter through the workforce and take time to change. Wells Fargo isn't the only bank turning to academics for culture assistance. Citigroup Inc. has an on-call ethicist it consults on weighty questions of right and wrong.",1
7-Mar-18,58.25,58.94,57.06,57.31,28491014,wells fargo,"Theranos Inc. plans to give additional shares to investors who pledge not to sue the battered blood-testing company or Elizabeth Holmes, its founder and chief executive, people familiar with the matter said. The deal includes investors who participated in Theranos's latest funding rounds, which ended in 2015 and brought in more than $600 million. Those investors could get about two additional shares for each share they bought, one of the people said. The additional shares would come from Ms. Holmes's personal stake in Theranos, some of the people said. That would result in her relinquishing her majority ownership of the closely held Palo Alto, Calif., company, some of the people said. People familiar with the deal said it was approved by Theranos's board in February. Investors are still reviewing terms of the proposed agreement, but most have signaled that they will sign off on it, these people said. ""This is an affirmative development for the company, providing a path forward in partnership with employees, investors and other stakeholders,"" said Theranos director Daniel Warmenhoven. ""Elizabeth elected to contribute her own equity to protect any dilution of shares held by other parties."" He said Ms. Holmes showed ""a level of selflessness and grace reflecting her commitment to the company's success."" The offer hasn't been publicly disclosed and follows months of negotiations with some of Theranos's largest investors, according to the people. Theranos received much of its funding from high-profile private investors who weren't part of the ecosystem that typically backs startups. They paid $15 a share to $17 a share, but the value has likely eroded sharply due to Theranos's operational and regulatory woes, which led to the closure of its two laboratories last year. The additional shares would lower the investors' effective cost to about $5 a share. Theranos reached a separate agreement to buy back the shares purchased in early 2015 by Rupert Murdoch for about $125 million, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Murdoch is executive chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox Inc. News Corp is the parent of The Wall Street Journal. Under the terms of that deal, Theranos agreed to pay Mr. Murdoch a nominal amount equal to a tiny fraction of the original purchase price, the people said. One person familiar with the matter said the amount was just $1. Mr. Murdoch could be entitled to an additional payment under certain circumstances, one person said. According to people familiar with the matter, he had refused to join the broad agreement with investors and wanted to sell his shares to Theranos so he could take an investment loss for tax purposes, potentially saving millions of dollars in taxes owed on other income. Tax experts said Mr. Murdoch wouldn't have been able to claim the deduction without finding a buyer for his Theranos shares. ""We get to realize losses when we make bad investments, but one has to exit to do that,"" said Michael Knoll, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Other investors who purchased shares during Theranos's later funding rounds include the family of U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the Waltons of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and John Elkann, the Italian industrialist who controls Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. Representatives of those investors didn't respond to requests for comment Thursday. Partner Fund Management LP, a San Francisco hedge fund that sued Theranos in October, isn't participating in the investor agreement, people familiar with the matter said. The hedge fund has alleged that Theranos fraudulently solicited a $96 million investment through misleading statements about the company's capabilities. Theranos has said it is fighting the lawsuit. Theranos shareholders who invested in earlier funding rounds wouldn't be included in the deal and haven't been told about it by the company, several of them told the Journal. After the Journal raised questions about Theranos's technology and practices, federal health regulators last year investigated and revoked the testing license from Theranos's main lab and banned Ms. Holmes from the lab industry for at least two years. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department launched investigations of the company. Theranos has said it is cooperating with the probes and appealing the regulatory sanctions, which are on hold pending the outcome of those proceedings. It exited the lab business in October, saying it was retrenching to focus on developing new testing technology to sell to other companies. In November, drugstore giant Walgreen Co. alleged Theranos had breached a contract between the companies. Theranos has said the allegations are unfounded and is fighting a suit filed by the Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. unit.Other recent changes at Theranos include the departure of litigator David Boies and former Wells Fargo & Co. Chief Executive Richard Kovacevich from Theranos's board, according to a person familiar with the matter.The departures haven't been announced, and the company's website on Thursday afternoon still listed the two men as directors.Theranos will add to its board a representative of the late-stage investors, this person said. Ms. Holmes also is a Theranos director.Mr. Boies has long been one of the country's best-known litigators and fiercely defended Theranos. Those efforts included threatening to take legal action against the Journal during the months before it published in October 2015 its first article detailing problems at the company.He planned to resign from the board last summer but stayed on after other directors said his departure would send dire signals about Theranos, a person familiar with the matter said.At the end of last year, Theranos had $200 million of cash on hand, not including $40 million in debt to Walgreens that is part of the two companies' legal dispute, Theranos told shareholders in a January conference call. One person familiar with the matter said Theranos now has about $150 million or less in cash, excluding the debt.",1
7-Mar-18,59.47,59.82,58.32,58.41,17869070,wells fargo,"WASHINGTON -- U.S. regulators gave 15 regional banks a passing grade on their ""living will"" plans for bankruptcy, a victory for those firms that demonstrates how their regulatory environment is significantly less stressful than for the largest U.S. banks. The verdicts from the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. mean regional banks -- including U.S. Bancorp, PNC Financial Services Group Inc. and Capital One Financial Corp. -- have for the moment satisfied regulators that they have feasible plans for going through bankruptcy without needing a taxpayer bailout. The plans, known as ""living wills,"" are required under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law. The exercise is significant for banks because if regulators don't approve of them, sanctions such as higher capital requirements or forced breakups can be imposed. This is the first time regulators have issued a judgment about regional banks' plans. The firms will have to continue submitting plans in the future. The one exception Friday was Northern Trust Corp. Regulators said they concluded that firm has ""a number of shortcomings"" in its living will, related to the funding and internal services available to keep the firm operating during a bankruptcy. They required the firm to address the perceived shortcomings by the end of this year. A Northern Trust spokesman said the bank ""maintains a strong financial position"" and has been making improvements since it submitted its living will to regulators. The positive verdict for the regional banks stands in contrast to outcomes for eight of the largest U.S. banks. In April 2016, the Fed and FDIC concluded all eight of those firms had shortcomings in their plans and saw problems so severe in five of the firms that they said the plans didn't meet the Dodd-Frank standard. In December 2016, regulators said most of those firms had addressed their concerns. They also said Wells Fargo & Co. hadn't and restricted some of the firm's business activities. Also Friday, regulators gave four large foreign-owned banks guidance about how to improve their living wills. Those firms will have until July 2018 to conform plans to the guidance. The firms are Barclays PLC, Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG and UBS Group AG.",1
7-Mar-18,60.03,60.48,59.21,59.21,17024431,wells fargo,"Wells Fargo & Co. said Tuesday that it was downgraded on a key regulatory rating that focuses on its ability and willingness to lend to, invest in and service lower-income populations. The San Francisco bank received a ""needs to improve"" Community Reinvestment Act rating because of its regulatory consent orders related to its sales-practices scandal, the bank said. Wells Fargo added in a securities filing Tuesday that the rating results in the loss of expedited processing of applications for certain activities. The bank also must receive prior regulatory approval for other activities, such as issuing or prepaying certain debt, opening or relocating bank branches or making certain investments. The rating could affect the bank's relationships with certain states, counties, municipalities or other public agencies. A spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which conducts the Community Reinvestment Act evaluations, said the agency doesn't comment on them. The CRA rating covered 2009 to 2012. The bank has been looking as far back as 2009 and 2010 to uncover consumer financial harm related to its aggressive sales tactics. In September, it paid a $185 million fine and was dealt regulatory consent orders for opening as many as 2.1 million accounts using fictitious or unauthorized customer information. In congressional hearings in September, politicians grilled now-former Chief Executive John Stumpf about whether more vulnerable customer segments, including lower-income populations, were affected more than others. A spokeswoman said Tuesday the bank doesn't collect race and ethnicity information for deposit and credit-card accounts. Also on Tuesday, Wells Fargo said it has reached a $110 million tentative agreement to resolve a class-action complaint tied to its sales practices scandal. The latest settlement proposal, which requires court approval, would cover customers who allege similar practices starting in Jan. 1, 2009. Wells Fargo has for the past several months been refunding money to customers who incurred costs from unwanted accounts or cards. On the CRA rating, Wells Fargo CEO Timothy Sloan said in a statement the bank is ""disappointed with this rating given Wells Fargo's strong track record of lending to, investing in and providing service to low- and moderate-income communities."" He added that the bank is committed to addressing the OCC's concerns.The Wall Street Journal in December reported that this downgrade would be likely.In the last two years, the OCC and other bank regulators have more aggressively lowered other banks' ratings, including last year those of Fifth Third Bancorp and Regions Financial Corp., based on the rule, which has been around for decades",1
6-Mar-18,59.75,60,58.95,59.97,16478259,wells fargo,"As part of its turnaround plan, Citizens Financial Group Inc. has touted a program that invites customers into branches for what the bank calls a financial checkup. It said 400,000 such meetings were scheduled last year. Eleven current and former Citizens branch employees in five states claim that information about some meetings was fabricated by those employees or others as they struggled to meet goals set by the bank. ""For a week or so, I had my bankers [try to make] real appointments. No one was picking up the phone,"" said a former branch manager in Massachusetts, recalling when the ""Citizens Checkup"" program was introduced in February 2016. ""So we put random people's names down and said, 'We have an appointment.' "" After a fake appointment was supposed to have occurred, bankers would either sometimes mark that the customer didn't show up or attended but didn't sign up for any new products, the former employees said. One former Citizens branch manager in New York state recalled putting stars or exclamation points on falsified forms to make them look like authentic meeting notes. Citizens said in a statement that it has ""no data to suggest that any aspect of the Citizens Checkup program was fabricated or falsified"" and has ""strict controls and standards to ensure that inappropriate behavior is detected and addressed."" Brad Conner, head of consumer banking at Citizens, said in a separate statement that, ""We take every allegation seriously, and our chief conduct officer will lead a thorough review."" The bank added any new program entails change and that, ""as expected, a small number of colleagues have struggled in making the transition to having deep needs-based conversations."" The former Citizens employees said they falsified information because of pressure to meet expectations related to the program and time constraints from other banking responsibilities. They also said they believed that doing so wouldn't hurt customers. In response, Citizens said, ""While all of our colleagues go through significant training to be prepared for conducting a checkup, this new approach may not suit everyone, which may explain why you identified a handful of detractors."" Providence, R.I.-based Citizens has more than $149 billion in assets and 1,200 branches in 11 states, primarily in the Northeast; it is the 10th-largest U.S. commercial bank by assets. Since going public in 2014, Citizens, a former unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, has worked to turn around its business by improving profitability and increasing revenue. Banks, investors and regulators have been scrutinizing bank-sales programs since a scandal over sales tactics erupted last fall at Wells Fargo & Co. Some firms have played down sales goals since then, though Citizens has continued to emphasize its appointment program and other sales goals, according to current and former employees. The information that the current and former Citizens employees said was falsified doesn't involve opening customer accounts without consent, the practice that led to Wells Fargo's problems. But the claims by current and former employees that information was falsified at Citizens could raise questions about the accuracy of data the bank presented to investors and about the bank's corporate culture and internal controls. ""Investors are potentially hurt if executives go out and talk to the Street about basically phantom appointments that don't exist,"" said Clifford Rossi, a professor at the University of Maryland's business school. The appointment-setting program was part of a broader push to bring in more than $60 million in new revenue for 2016. Citizens had total revenue of $5.3 billion last year. Last June, Mr. Conner told investors at a conference that the initiative was ""near the top of the things that we're most excited about."" Mr. Conner added at that time, ""We've contacted over 300,000 -- about 325,000 of our customers. We've been able to schedule 80,000 appointments for a checkup, and we're getting really great feedback from both our customers and our colleagues in terms of the receptivity from our customer base."" Citizens has also presented data on the appointments in materials accompanying quarterly earnings. The bank told The Wall Street Journal that figures on the program presented to investors weren't overstated and that those metrics were ""not a key financial measure."" To make appointments, Citizens' staffers cold-call customers, the bank said. The goal, current and former employees said, was to eventually sell more banking products. Citizens' push for customer appointments reflects Chief Executive Bruce Van Saun's stated desire for branches to become advice centers. The bank said a two-part phone survey of nearly 1,000 customers who were called for a checkup appointment found 95% who kept the appointment said the meeting was useful. The bank also said in response to questions from the Journal that surveys of its own branch employees haven't turned up evidence of widespread staff dissatisfaction with the checkups. The 11 current and former branch employees, however, said the program ran into problems. For starters, few customers picked up the phone -- and of those that did, not many wanted an appointment, the bankers said. A former Citizens banker in New York state said he was initially enthusiastic after going through specialized training. But no matter how he pitched it in calls in the spring of 2016, ""people still felt it was a telemarketer call,"" said the banker. ""We feel good about our sales practices, and the checkup approach is an important element of why we do,"" the bank said. Bankers, who were often told by managers to make 25 cold calls a day, were given a script, some of the current and former bankers said. If a customer wasn't interested, the bank suggested in the script reviewed by the Journal that the banker say: ""Just like you would meet with a doctor or dentist every six months or year it is important to review your financial health as well."" At some branches, calls were expected to yield between 10 and 15 checkup appointments per banker per week, some of the current and former bankers said. The bank disputes the goal figures for calls and appointments. It said that, while individual branches set their own expectations, it is more typical for 30 calls and two kept appointments a week to be expected of bankers. Nine current and former employees said they or others would typically enter false information into two computer systems, one tracking calls to customers, the other for appointments made, former bankers said. First, employees would mark that they called customers even though they hadn't. Next, the employees said, they or others would enter fake appointments into the system using the names of actual customers. Two former Citizens bankers said they often marked that a customer didn't show up for the checkup or didn't buy any products. The bank said it had worked with a consultant to track the progress of its program against those of other banks with similar arrangements. It added this didn't show anything amiss.",0
6-Mar-18,59.07,59.24,58.35,59.17,21099194,wells fargo,"U.S. companies are poised to report their strongest quarterly earnings in years, another sign that the stock-market rally could have further to run. Analysts expected earnings for S&P 500 companies to grow by 9.1% overall in the first quarter from a year earlier, as of March 31, which would mark the highest growth since the fourth quarter of 2011, according to FactSet. Still, analysts have trimmed their profit expectations since the start of the year, and disappointing results could stoke concerns that stock-price gains have outpaced earnings growth. Reporting season heats up over the next few weeks, with banks including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. expected to report results next week and giants like Johnson & Johnson, Verizon Communications Inc. and General Electric Co. scheduled the week after. Investors have been betting that U.S. corporate profits will soar this year, supercharged by a Trump agenda that includes tax cuts and looser regulations. Last month's collapse of the Republican health-care bill cast doubt on such policies, but a strong earnings season could give investors a reason to keep investing in stocks. Technology companies, among the best performers in the stock market this year, are expected to post some of the biggest earnings gains. Meanwhile, profits at industrial companies are projected to contract, potentially weighing on a sector that has lagged behind the broader S&P 500 this year after outperforming in the postelection rally. ""The buying and closing your eyes bit -- that part's gone,"" said Bret Chesney, senior portfolio manager at Alpine Global Management LLC. ""I think now is when we really start to be dependent on what the hard numbers show."" Apple Inc., whose stock is up 25% this year, was expected to report per-share earnings of $2.02 for its latest quarter as of March 31, up from $1.90 a share in the year-earlier period. Shares of the world's most valuable company hit a record this year partly on bets that its 10th-anniversary iPhone, expected later this year, will keep momentum building at the firm. The company posted a profit in January after three consecutive quarters of declines. Apple declined to comment. Oil prices also have rebounded from their 2016 lows, a factor that should help energy companies -- the biggest laggards in previous earnings seasons -- improve results. Energy companies are expected to be the biggest contributors to earnings growth for the first quarter -- accounting for more than a third of the broader index's projected gains, according to FactSet. Revenue also is expected to pick up for S&P 500 companies overall, after many had relied on cost-cutting to improve profits during the recovery from the financial crisis -- an encouraging sign for some investors who were looking for more sustainable growth. For the first quarter, S&P 500 firms are projected to report revenue growth of 7.1%, the biggest jump in more than five years, according to FactSet. Improving corporate health and U.S. economic data have supported stocks since the second half of last year, helping the rally weather shifts in fiscal-policy expectations. Over the past year, S&P 500 companies have rebounded from a five-quarter earnings slump, wage growth has firmed and consumer confidence has risen to a more than 16-year-high. A dollar rally, which some worried would cut into exporters' profits, has stalled this year after a postelection surge. Analysts have pared back their expectations for first-quarter earnings since the start of the year, but the cuts have been smaller than the average over the past five years, according to FactSet. As of year-end, analysts estimated first-quarter earnings growth would be 12.5%. But disappointing earnings could dent stocks' recent gains. Shares of industrial and materials companies, which helped lead the rally between Election Day and the end of 2016, posted the largest declines since then in expected earnings. As of March 31, analysts expected General Electric to post first-quarter per-share earnings of 17 cents, down from the 21 cents it reported a year earlier, according to FactSet. Analysts had expected first-quarter earnings of 29 cents per share at the end of 2016. The company -- whose stock is down 5% this year after a 7.4% advance between Election Day and year-end -- has faced pressure from activist investors to slash expenses after missing profit targets last year, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Mining firm Freeport-McMoRan Inc. was expected March 31 to post earnings of 18 cents a share for the first quarter, compared with a loss of 16 cents a year earlier but down from analysts' year-end estimate of 41 cents a share, according to FactSet. The company said in March that, because of a standoff with regulators, it had to scale back output and lay off workers in Indonesia, where it derives roughly a third of its copper output. Its stock is up 2.7% this year after rising 9.1% between Election Day and the end of 2016. GE and Freeport declined to comment. Still, company management has been upbeat. S&P 500 firms used the word ""optimistic"" in 52% of earnings calls for the fourth-quarter earnings season, the most ever in Bank of America Merrill Lynch data going back to 2003. At the same time, company-issued guidance was ""nothing to write home about,"" the firm noted. The gap between firms' confidence and their future earnings estimates reflects a concern among some investors and analysts: That stocks have run up at a pace beyond what is warranted by earnings results. Major indexes' gains since November have made them even more expensive relative to their historical valuations, raising some concerns that they could be vulnerable to a pullback.",1
6-Mar-18,59.88,60.17,58.68,58.81,17948561,wells fargo,"Nancy Schrum watched curiously as a colleague from her law firm waved an iPhone above a credit-card reader to buy a Subway sandwich with Apple Pay earlier this year. ""I have that, but I'm afraid to use it,"" said Ms. Schrum of York, Pa., who feared the technology wouldn't work. When Apple Inc. launched its mobile-payment service more than two years ago, it hoped to speed up the checkout process and, ultimately, to replace physical wallets for U.S. consumers. Apple Pay has made significant headway, but Ms. Schrum's wariness reflects a range of factors that analysts say have caused growth to undershoot their expectations, including security concerns about the service, retailers that don't accept it, and Apple's relatively paltry marketing. The pace of Apple Pay adoption has been ""disappointing even to conservative expectations,"" said Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures, a venture-capital firm specializing in tech research. Just 13% of the estimated 680 million iPhone users have used Apple Pay, according to the research firm. Eddy Cue, Apple senior vice president in charge of internet software and services, said the service has been adopted faster than other payment systems and he believes it will eventually replace cash, debit and credit cards as the primary payment system. ""Does it matter if we get there in two years, three years [or] five years?"" Mr. Cue said in an interview. ""Ultimately, no."" The service requires users to upload their credit or debit card to their iPhone wallet by scanning an image of it. To pay at the checkout line, they hold the phone -- or Apple Watch -- above a contactless payment terminal that uses a technology known as near-field communication to transmit the card's information. Fingerprint verification is required for security. The service can also be used to pay in apps and online. Many U.S. consumers remain wary of such a service, according to technology research firm Creative Strategies: 40% are concerned about the security risks of adding a credit or debit card to their phone, and more than 60% aren't familiar with contactless payments. Compounding Apple Pay's challenges, only a third of U.S. stores accept it as a form of payment, according to the Nilson Report. The payment-industry trade publication notes, however, that the service's rate of acceptance has more than doubled since 2015. ""If you can't use it everywhere, why are you going to switch?"" said Braden More, Wells Fargo & Co.'s head of partnerships and industry relations, who expresses surprise that more retailers haven't embraced mobile payments. He expects acceptance and usage to grow. Big names including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Kroger Co. haven't yet enabled Apple Pay, due in part to technical hurdles, and even at stores that do use the service, users say cashiers often aren't familiar with it. Paul Davis said he recently had to inform a McDonald's cashier in Cincinnati that the burger chain accepted Apple Pay and show her how. ""It happens all the time,"" he said. Vice President of Apple Pay Jennifer Bailey said Apple has a team working with merchants to instruct cashiers and add instructions to checkout manuals. She said more than half of the biggest 100 merchants in the U.S. have adopted Apple Pay, including Best Buy Co., Kohl's Corp. and Starbucks Corp. Loup Ventures' Mr. Munster, a longtime Apple analyst previously with brokerage Piper Jaffray Co., estimates Apple Pay last year handled $36 billion in transactions, far less than the $207 billion he had predicted by 2016 after Apple started the service. Apple doesn't disclose the number or value of Apple Pay transactions, but Chief Executive Tim Cook recently said the number of users has tripled over the past year and transaction volume increased more than sixfold last year. Apple Pay brought in $30 million in revenue last year, according to Sanford C. Bernstein -- a fraction of the $24.35 billion generated last fiscal year by Apple's services unit, which also comprises Apple's App store and iTunes. The company announced in January it aimed to double its services revenue by 2021. Apple Pay generates revenue from charging banks a slice of each transaction, often 0.15% per credit-card transaction and a half cent per debit-card purchase.",0

6-Mar-18,59.86,61.2651,59.78,59.95,18517576,wells fargo,"Wells Fargo & Co. has overhauled its credit-card-processing business after an internal probe found some employees falsely reported customers' sales and pushed small firms into costly contracts they didn't understand. The bank has fired at least two dozen employees of Wells Fargo Merchant Services LLC in the past two years for those and other bank-policy violations, according to current managers. Wells Fargo also restructured the group last fall to reduce the incentives for using aggressive sales tactics, the executives said. The actions, which haven't been previously reported, show how Wells Fargo's sales-tactics problems extended beyond its consumer bank. That business was hit by last fall's revelation that employees opened as many as 2.1 million consumer-banking accounts without customers' knowledge to meet lofty sales goals. Wells Fargo discovered the full scale of abuses in the merchant-services business after undertaking a broad examination of the bank's business practices in light of the account-opening scandal. Wells Fargo said it has taken ""significant steps"" over the past several years to strengthen Wells Fargo Merchant Services, its merchant-processing unit for credit- and debit-card payments. The bank had fired some merchant-processing employees before the wider scandal broke last fall. After taking a deeper look into the business in the wake of those problems, it terminated several other employees and revamped the division. Merchant processing, which involves helping businesses handle debit- and credit-card transactions for customers, might seem like a mundane business. But small-business owners and industry participants say high-pressure sales tactics are common. They add that complex pricing structures and costly early-termination penalties that can lock customers into contracts are also prevalent. Merchant processors collected about $18.15 billion in debit- and credit-card fees from merchants in 2016, according to the Nilson Report, a newsletter tracking the payments industry. Banks such as Wells Fargo, Bank of America Corp. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. are among the biggest players. Wells Fargo fired some staff in this business for policy violations after uncovering evidence that employees coached branch bankers to put false information into the bank's systems about small-business customers' sales, the current managers said. Firms with annual sales of less than $750,000 seeking to open accounts were automatically routed to call centers, under Wells Fargo policies at the time. To earn commissions, sales representatives sometimes inflated sales figures so they surpassed the threshold. As part of its broader overhaul of sales tactics last fall, the bank ended the practice of allowing retail-branch bankers to refer small-business customers to merchant-services employees without manager consent. That has caused referrals to the merchant-services unit to fall more than 50%, a former employee said.",0
6-Mar-18,59.67,60.43,59.67,59.95,18661930,wells fargo,"Mutual-fund T shares are on their way. But nobody knows exactly when. The shares -- the ""T"" is short for ""transaction"" -- were designed to comply with the new Labor Department fiduciary rule that its creators say is aimed at mitigating the conflicts of interest that crop up among financial advisers. One of the biggest: Advisers may recommend a higher-cost fund over a less-expensive option so that they'll get paid more. T shares aim to help remove that temptation by featuring uniform sales charges across all fund categories. No difference in price, no financial incentive to push one fund over another. But the fiduciary rule, originally set to go into effect April 10, is under review at the direction of President Donald Trump and the implementation has been delayed for at least 60 days. With the uncertainty, some fund companies have put on the brakes. They're not sure how much demand there will be from brokers -- so they're holding off on launching new T shares for now. (By the way, unrelated funds called T shares -- standing for ""tax"" -- already exist. Fidelity Investments renamed its old T shares as M shares, effective March 24, to avoid confusion. And Janus Capital Group has offered T shares, or ""third-party"" shares -- no-load shares sold by third-party intermediaries. At this point, it has no plan to rename those shares.) Here are five things for mutual-fund investors to know about the new share classes: 1. T Shares Could Replace Other Options Typically, T shares would charge a 2.5% load, or upfront sales fee, when sold, and a so-called 12b-1 fee of 0.25% to pay for distribution or other expenses, according to researcher Morningstar Inc. The front-end load may decline for larger purchases. In comparison, the maximum up-front load on an A share class is often 5% or more, according to Morningstar. In addition, loads on A shares vary tremendously -- and that concerns the Labor Department, as it may create a conflict of interest because advisers might have an incentive to push higher-load offerings, says Aron Szapiro, director of policy research at Morningstar Inc. ""We think that, should the fiduciary rule go forward unchanged, [T shares] probably will largely replace A shares, at least in the retirement marketplace,"" he says. 2. Some T Shares Are Already Available . . . About 50 T shares for 50 existing funds have already been launched by two firms -- Calamos Investments and Aegon's Transamerica unit -- and shares for 234 more from nine fund companies are expected to be launched between now and May, Morningstar says. An additional 78 fund companies have filed with regulators to launch 876 additional T shares, though no inception date has been set, Morningstar says. 3. . . .But Many Firms Are Waiting for Now Some fund companies have filed to launch T shares, and are prepared to move quickly if the fiduciary rule is implemented. But they're remaining on hold until there's more clarity from the Labor Department. ""Our members also would like to know the DOL's decision about revising or rescinding the rule, following President Trump's directive,"" says David Blass, general counsel of the Investment Company Institute. Fidelity filed with regulators to launch new T shares on 28 of its mutual funds in February. But at this point, ""a launch date is to be determined,"" a spokesman for Fidelity says. Nuveen Investments also has filed with regulators for permission to launch T shares, but has no specific plans to launch them or to withdraw its filing. Lord, Abbett & Co. LLC has applied for T shares and had them approved by regulators, but they're now on hold until it sees where the fiduciary rule is headed, a spokesman says. ""Depending on the outcome of the DOL rule, and if there is a continued demand by our partners in the marketplace, we would offer them,"" he says. Meanwhile, brokerage firms also say that they'll wait to see how the Labor Department deals with the fiduciary rule. ""At this point, we haven't decided how we're going to proceed on the share classes,"" says a spokesman for Morgan Stanley. ""We'll talk to our asset-management partners once we have more clarity on how the DOL fiduciary rule is evolving or how it evolved."" The brokerage arm of Wells Fargo & Co. also hasn't made a decision as to when it will offer T shares, a spokeswoman for the firm says. 4. T Shares Don't Satisfy Everyone Over time, investors -- who typically jump from fund to fund -- are likely to save money with T shares, says Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual-fund research at financial data and analysis provider CFRA. But some have criticized the share classes because, although their fees may be level across funds, brokers would still be selling clients funds with loads when superior no-load funds may exist. ""Less gouging is still gouging, and less self-dealing is still self-dealing, and doesn't satisfy the fiduciary requirement,"" says David Marotta, president of Marotta Wealth Management, a fee-only registered investment-advisory firm in Charlottesville, Va. ""Find me any fund that has a high sales charge, and I'll find you a better mix of low-fee funds."" 5. Alternatives Are Emerging Some fund companies are planning another type of share class that could address the Labor Department's conflict concerns. They've designed what are known as clean shares, which include fees for investment management and administrative costs, but are stripped of the fees charged by those who sell the funds to investors, such as broker-dealers. With clean shares, brokers would set their own commissions for selling the shares, which makes it easier for investors to see what they're paying for. Lord Abbett, for example, last week launched what it calls F3 shares, which charge management fees, but no fees to pay distributors. Capital Group's American Funds also offers F3 shares.Janus has filed to launch P shares, which are similar to other firms' new T shares. When they will be offered is uncertain at this point.",0
6-Mar-18,59.82,60.1,59.15,60.02,22397333,wells fargo,"A new report on the sales scandal at Wells Fargo & Co. portrayed its former chief executive as a tone-deaf leader who protected an irresponsible lieutenant and worked for board members who didn't keep the pair in check. The report, a long-awaited investigation of a scandal that ensnared the bank with regulators and politicians this past September, also said Wells Fargo's board will claw back an additional $75 million in pay from former Chief Executive John Stumpf and the lieutenant, former retail-bank chief Carrie Tolstedt. The latest decisions on pay brought the total money clawed back from current and former Wells Fargo executives to $182.8 million, an amount that rivals the fine the bank paid last year and that its board described as the largest clawback ever for any financial-services firm. The 113-page report, released Monday, is likely to be the board's final deep dive into the questionable conduct that dated back to 2002 and ultimately resulted in a $185 million penalty last year. It likely won't be the final discussion, however, of the high-pressure sales strategy that led to as many as 2.1 million accounts being created using fictitious or unauthorized customer information. ""The Board's report is a necessary examination of what went wrong in our culture, operations, and governance,"" Wells Fargo CEO Timothy Sloan said in a statement. ""I wish we would've taken more action and done things more quickly,"" Mr. Sloan said later on a call with reporters. The San Francisco-based bank continues to face federal and state investigations about its sales practices. And last week, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. suggested Wells Fargo investors vote against 12 of the bank's 15 directors at the firm's annual meeting April 25. In Monday's report, prepared by a board committee of independent directors and law firm Shearman & Sterling LLP, much of the blame fell on Mr. Stumpf and his protege, Ms. Tolstedt. A lawyer for Ms. Tolstedt, Enu Mainigi of Williams & Connolly LLP, said: ""We strongly disagree with the report and its attempt to lay blame with Ms. Tolstedt. A full and fair examination of the facts will produce a different conclusion."" Mr. Stumpf's lawyer declined to comment. Mr. Stumpf last fall apologized and in congressional hearings took responsibility for the scandal. The report also highlighted how the bank's push to boost revenue and profit trickled down to thousands of employees who felt pressured to meet unrealistic sales goals. One Wells Fargo branch manager, for example, had a teenage daughter with 24 accounts, an adult daughter with 18, a husband with 21, a brother with 14 and a father with four. Ms. Tolstedt was singled out 142 times in the report for setting the tone in the troubled retail-banking unit. At one point, she is described as being ""scared to death"" of hurting her unit's sales figures. The board decided last week to claw back Ms. Tolstedt's outstanding stock options valued at about $47.3 million. It also is taking away -- through scheduled retirement benefits -- an additional $28 million of incentive compensation paid to Mr. Stumpf in March 2016. The board's review caps a six-month investigation that not only has rocked Wells Fargo but the broader banking industry, with dozens of firms examining their own sales practices at the behest of regulators. Years of aggressive sales tactics in pockets around the country led to Wells Fargo's September settlement. Since then politicians, regulators and customers among others, have criticized the bank. In February, it reached a preliminary settlement for $110 million over a customer class action case. Other state and federal investigations are continuing and the bank has said it is cooperating. Improper sales issues began to escalate within Wells Fargo as far back as 2002, the report noted, years earlier than the bank has agreed to check for consumer harm. The bank has said it is going back an additional two years beyond the 2011-to-2016 time frame regulators called for in last year's consent orders. Mr. Sloan said Monday that Wells Fargo will make things ""right"" with customers who reach out to the bank with problems related to the sales practices, regardless of the timing. By 2004, a Wells Fargo's internal investigations employee wrote to executives in that group about sales issues, according to the report. As early as 2012, some top Wells Fargo retail banking and risk executives knew the firm had a problem with its strategy of ""cross selling"" multiple products to the same customers. The issue gained more exposure with a Los Angeles Times story on the topic and a 2015 lawsuit by the Los Angeles City Attorney. The board's efforts to understand the scope of the issues were hampered by the ""insular and defensive"" way in which Ms. Tolstedt ran her division, as well as Mr. Stumpf's loyalty to her, the report said. Mr. Stumpf ""was by nature an optimistic executive who refused to believe that the sales model was seriously impaired,"" the report said. ""He was too late and too slow to call for inspection of or critical challenge to the basic business model."" In late 2015, key board members including lead independent director Stephen Sanger pushed Mr. Stumpf to remove Ms. Tolstedt from her role. But Mr. Stumpf declined, saying that Ms. Tolstedt, while at times controlling, was ""the best banker in America,"" the report said. Ms. Tolstedt ultimately left her role in July 2016. Mr. Stumpf abruptly retired in October.",1

6-Mar-18,56.06,58.09,55.95,58,24234222,wells fargo,"Five KPMG LLP partners, including the head of its audit practice, were fired after the Big Four accounting firm improperly obtained information about which audits its regulator planned to inspect, the company said. The company's regulator, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, began investigating a leak discovered in February of its plans to inspect KPMG's work. Among the fired KPMG employees was Scott Marcello, who was a partner and headed the audit practice, the company said. An employee of the accounting board who leaked the information to KPMG left the PCAOB after the leak was reported to the regulator, which oversees firms that audit U.S.-traded public companies, according to the PCAOB. The firm on Tuesday confirmed the role of its executives and their firings after being contacted by The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Marcello didn't respond to requests for comment. Also among those fired was David Middendorf, KPMG's national managing partner for audit quality and professional practice, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Middendorf couldn't immediately be reached for comment. The identities of the other fired partners weren't known Tuesday evening. The company said it also dismissed a sixth employee, whose identity and role couldn't be learned. The breach is the latest incident that spotlights concerns about and challenges at KPMG and the other Big Four accounting firms. KPMG audits Wells Fargo & Co. and has faced questions about why it didn't uncover the bank's sales-practice scandal before the lender reached a $185 million settlement with regulators last fall. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, another member of the Big Four, also faced a trial on allegations by MF Global Holdings Ltd. that bad advice from the accounting firm had contributed to MF Global's collapse. The claims were resolved with a confidential settlement between the parties. The accounting board, which is investigating the actions of its former employee, hired an outside law firm to examine the incident, according to people familiar with the matter. The board was created by Congress after the accounting scandals that took down Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc. to exclusively police the audits of listed companies' financial results. Its employees earn some of the highest salaries among all financial regulators, a practice designed to discourage them from switching sides and going to work for the audit firms. The KPMG employee who received the leak formerly worked at the accounting board, according to the audit firm. The company said the person received ""improper advance warnings of engagements to be inspected,"" and shared it with other KPMG executives. KPMG says it told both the accounting board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the board, about the leak as soon as it was discovered. ""KPMG has zero tolerance for such unethical behavior,"" said Lynne Doughtie, KPMG's chairman and CEO. ""KPMG is committed to the highest standards of professionalism, integrity and quality, and we are dedicated to the capital markets we serve. We are taking additional steps to ensure that such a situation should not happen again."" A spokeswoman for the accounting board said the organization has taken steps to ""maintain and reinforce the integrity of its inspection process"" since discovering the leak. The leaked information relates to annual inspections the accounting board performs of each of the major accounting firms, reviewing dozens of a firm's audits to gauge performance and compliance with auditing rules. Inspections are particularly sensitive because they are the board's primary means of assessing audit quality. Inspectors can fault the accounting firms for deficiencies, and the findings are widely seen as a report card for how the firms are performing and whether audit quality is getting better or worse. The accounting board's inspections tend to focus on the most difficult businesses and transactions, ones in which it believes accountants may have cut corners or made mistakes. The inspectors generally give accounting firms two to three weeks' notice about the audits they intend to examine, according to people familiar with the matter. Because the accounting board sometimes inspects more than 60 annual audits performed by a Big Four firm, the board often will disclose them in batches of five to 10 so the auditors can gather records and fill out forms associated with the inspection. If an accounting firm found out which audits would be subject to inspection before it completed them, it could devote more time to those projects to ensure they pass muster with regulators, the people said. If it learned after an audit was issued, any last-minute changes to an audit or the work papers behind it would have to be documented under board rules. The news of the leak is ""pretty eye-opening,"" said Bryan Church, an accounting professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology. ""These guys feel enormous pressure dealing with inspectors, and they do stupid things."" Mr. Marcello had been KPMG's vice chairman of audit, the firm's top executive overseeing its U.S. audit practice, since 2015. Mr. Marcello also sat on the firm's management committee, which implements KPMG policies as decided by its board.",1
15-Mar-18,56.36,57.12,55.88,56.5,24401292,wells fargo,"Commercial real-estate lending by banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions is declining as sales activity slows and regulators voice concern about the sector. Lenders closed roughly $491 billion of mortgage loans backed by U.S. property in 2016, down 3% from 2015, according to new statistics from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Most of the decline occurred in the fourth quarter, when volume was 7% lower than the 2015 quarter, according to Jamie Woodwell, the trade group's head of commercial-property research. Despite the decrease, the new-volume number was the third highest since the association began doing the survey, behind 2015 and the record year of 2007. The decline from 2015 to 2016 was due partly to a slowing of property sales, meaning fewer buyers needed financing. ""There's a very tight correlation"" between the two, Mr. Woodwell said. Buyers, for their part, are getting jittery because values have been rising for eight years and are near records. In all, investors purchased $493.7 billion of U.S. commercial property in 2016, down 10% from 2015, according to Real Capital Analytics. Activity has slowed further this year. Investors purchased just $50.3 billion worth of U.S. commercial property in the first two months of 2017, compared with $80.1 billion during the period in 2016, according to Real Capital Analytics. Regulators have been expressing concern about overheated commercial real-estate lending. At the end of 2016's third quarter there were 521 institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. with potentially worrisome concentrations of risk, according to an FDIC report this year. That is up from 474 institutions in the 2015 third quarter, the report said. Yet banks and insurers are getting more aggressive over deals as investment in the sector declines. New lenders also are emerging on the scene, including investment funds formed by private-equity firms that are focused on real-estate debt. ""It's tougher right now,"" said Craig Bender, who heads up ING Groep NV's U.S. real-estate lending business. ""The banks are hungry. The life-insurance companies are hungry."" Many bank executives view the commercial-property market as healthy, given rising rents and occupancies. Wells Fargo & Co., the country's largest commercial-property market lender, expects to lend about $30 billion this year, about the same as in 2016 and 2015, according to Mark Myers, the bank's head of commercial real estate. Those amounts are ""high-water marks"" for the bank, he said. Still, the bank recognizes that property values are at record levels after rising for eight years. ""I'd say, if I could look back one year ago, we're probably more cautious"" now, Mr. Myers said.",1

With an oversupply of malls, changing consumer habits and increasing competition from e-commerce, property owners frequently have to spruce up their assets to make them trendier and draw more foot traffic. But the process of getting the financing for this reinvestment has gotten more complicated, said analysts, lenders and landlords. Lenders now grill landlords repeatedly about tenants' creditworthiness and exposure to competition from neighboring developments and e-commerce. On top of that, borrowers may have to pay higher interest rates than they are used to, as the perception of risk increases and the Federal Reserve boosts short-term interest rates. ""There is a sea change in attitudes over the last eight months,"" said Joseph Miller, co-founder of Runyon Group, a real-estate company with offices in Los Angeles and New York. ""Everyone is more cautious."" A broad swath of banks, private-equity funds and insurance companies ""have a risk-off approach and are more selective,"" he said. Loan terms have become more conservative. The average size of a retail real-estate loan was $8.3 million in 2016, down from $12.2 million in 2015, according to data from Real Capital Analytics. The average loan-to-value ratio fell to 66% in 2016 from 70% in 2015, while the average occupancy rate of the underlying properties rose to 98% in 2016 from 92% in 2015. A steady drumbeat of store closures is escalating concerns about the fate of retail shopping centers, especially lower-tier malls and strip centers. Major retailers such as Macy's Inc., Sears Holdings Corp. and J.C. Penney Co. have said in recent months they plan to close as many as 290 stores, while Payless Shoe Source Inc. last week filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and said it would close 400 stores. Real-estate executives and financiers said it is more difficult these days to value shopping centers amid the shift in shopping habits. ""Lenders are more forward-looking this time, and question what the property is going to look like five years from now,"" said Eric Wolf, managing director at Katz Properties LLC, a property investment, development and management firm. ""There is more face time with lenders, and you go over things, and go over again,"" said Mr. Wolf, whose firm owns 27 shopping centers in the U.S. Mall values can drop more sharply than residential and office properties if anchor tenants close and surrounding tenants then peter out. J.C. Penney and Macy's closed stores at Hudson Valley Mall in Kingston, N.Y., in 2015 and 2016, respectively, and the value of the mall plummeted 90%. The mall was valued at $87 million in 2010. Last December, Kroll Bond Rating Agency said it was valued at $8.1 million. Not all malls are struggling. Some better-quality properties in affluent coastal cities with a steady stream of tourists continue to boost rents. Larger mall operators still make hefty investments in their best properties to keep them competitive. Mr. Miller's Runyon Group recently secured a $47 million, 10-year securitized loan from Wells Fargo & Co. to refinance a mixed-use, open-air retail and office property in Los Angeles. ""Generally in two to three years, interest rates will be higher,"" said Mr. Miller. ""We're stress-testing our business plans to be successful in an environment like that.""",1
15-Mar-18,57.33,57.44,55.35,55.4,43569719,wells fargo,"Investors get a first look at bank earnings under President Donald Trump this week. The biggest U.S. banks kick off the first-quarter earnings season Thursday morning with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co. and Citigroup Inc. each reporting results for the three months ended March 31. Investors will seek to judge whether the outlook for the firms will live up to the sharp rise in bank stocks since the election, reflecting expectations that growth will pick up under Trump administration policies. Most big banks are forecast to show higher profits compared with last year's dismal first quarter, when plunging oil prices, concerns about China's economy and tough trading conditions weighed on results. But over the past 90 days, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters have revised their revenue estimates lower for three banks -- Citigroup, J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. -- and raised them a bit for Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo. One reason for analysts' hesitancy is a surprising, sharp slowdown in business lending since late 2016. Commercial and industrial loans, which account for the bulk of many banks' loan portfolios, expanded by a 1% annual rate in January and shrank by a 1.3% annual rate in February, according to Federal Reserve data. That is a steep decline from the pace of expansion over much of the past year.",1

Bank stocks were among the biggest winners late last year, with the KBW Nasdaq Bank index soaring 22% from Nov. 8 to the end of 2016. But since then the bank index has underperformed. Now, Wall Street will be watching closely as three of the biggest lenders in the U.S. -- J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo -- all report first-quarter earnings on Thursday. Analysts expect Wells Fargo, which benefits less than the others from elevated market activity and is still contending with the aftermath of its account-sales fiasco, to post a 3% year-over-year decline in earnings per share, according to FactSet. J.P. Morgan and Citigroup are both expected to report 13% increases in first-quarter earnings per share. This still represents a dialing down of expectations: As of the end of last year, analysts estimated first-quarter increases of 16% and 20%, respectively, for the two banks. A few developments have contributed to this tempering of analyst views: Long-term interest rates, which shot up following the election, have since come down a bit as markets are less sure that growth and inflation will accelerate. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasurys has fallen to 2.30% from 2.48% at the end of 2016. Loan growth has slowed significantly and mysteriously since November. Investors will be eager to hear what is causing this. Finally, market trading activity, which rose strongly in the second half of last year, has been relatively subdued. Still, these negatives are likely to be more than offset by several positive factors in the first quarter. For now, net interest margins are more sensitive to short-term than long-term rates, meaning banks will see real benefits from recent Federal Reserve tightening. Wells Fargo is still expensive at 1.6 times book value. But J.P. Morgan Chase looks fairly valued at 1.3 times, and Citigroup remains downright cheap at just 0.8 times. Bank shares have gotten off to a weak start this year. The rest of 2017 should give them a boost.",1
