Bank of America,SEX GURU'S CHARM OFFENSIVE How a cult leader totally took over an Oregon town and destroyed lives," Mar 18, 2018",0,"Before the cult leader arrived, Antelope, Ore., was a sleepy town: less than a square mile in size, with just 45
residents who were mostly retired or working as ranch hands. But a bling-obsessed guru changed all that.
It happened in 1981, after free-love sage Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh bought a 64,000-acre ranch adjacent to
Antelope for $5.75 million. His aim: to create a utopia where followers - many of them Western professionals -
could adhere to his teachings. There was naked meditation, chanting and group sex. Soon, some 1,600 acolytes
materialized. They built houses and stores and created their own police and fire departments. But the utopia
collapsed within three years, amid a storm of power grabs, botched murder and arson.
Now, the story's being told in ""Wild Wild Country,"" a new six-part documentary series streaming on Netflix.
Born in 1931 in India, Bhagwan - the son of a cloth merchant - received an M.A. in philosophy and, by 1970, had
developed a way of thinking that merged Eastern teachings (including yoga and Buddhism) with penchants for
carnality and wealth (he boasted of owning 93 Rolls-Royces). He was so charismatic, people predicted he could be
a second Buddha. ""Bhagwan had a vision to transform humanity,"" said Chapman Way, who created the series with
his brother Maclain. ""Westerners flocked."" They paid to stay at Bhagwan's ashram in India, and made him so rich
that he started his own bank.
As Bhagwan filled 20,000-seat stadiums, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi viewed the guru as a societal threat.
According to Maclain, ""there was an assassination attempt"" when a fundamental Hindu threw a knife at Bhagwan
during a sermon. So he dispatched his spokeswoman, Sheela ""Ma Anand"" Silverman, to search for a location in America. The
burgeoning Oregon community, incorporated as Rajneeshpuram, caught the attention of Arianna Huffington, actor
Terence Stamp and Francoise Ruddy (ex-wife of ""The Godfather"" producer Al Ruddy), who contributed $200,000.
""At first, they were seen as strange - not as a threat,"" said Antelope resident John Silvertooth of the followers.
""Then they started buying property.""
SILVERTOOTH added, ""They moved enough people in to get a majority on the town council . . . which changed the
name of Antelope to Rajneesh. Main Street turned into Bhagwan Boulevard."" Nudists took over the town park.
One former ranch resident, who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity, said that the Rajneeshees took
part in ritualistic dances to ""open up your heart."" Her family had been involved with Bhagwan since the mid-1970s,
but she didn't really buy into his teachings. Still, when her husband wanted to take their children, then 8 and 12, to
the commune, around 1983, she went.
""It just struck fear in me,"" she said of the scene. ""It was a cult.""
Group therapy sessions included sex as a tool for releasing repression. As Silverman wrote, ""Everyone was so
crazy for enlightenment . . . [that they] took part in sexual encounters, emptied their pockets and proved their
devotion [through] expensive gifts.""
The former ranch resident said that ""free love"" was rampant.
""It was part of finding yourself and opening your heart to whomever you felt attracted to,"" she said, adding that her
husband strayed from their marriage during his time in the cult. ""I actually never had any contact with him [in
Rajneeshpuram]. It was part of my struggle. He was there with someone else.""
Silvertooth remembered picking up a teenage hitchhiker who fled the ranch: ""He told me he was sick of being
raped.""
Seemingly unstoppable, Bhagwan launched a power grab to take over Wasco County - where the ranch resided - in
the same way he had taken over Antelope. His followers claimed that it was for the survival of their community,
which politicians had threatened to shut down.
A plan was hatched before the November 1984 county commission election: Bus in homeless men and women
who, per state law, could gain voting rights by living there for 20 days, and get two Rajneeshees onto the
commission. Some 5,000 people were recruited from shelters in New York City, Phoenix and San Diego with the
promise of ""A beautiful city in Oregon . . . where you can get two beers per day."" But county authorities refused to
register them, saying that the Rajneeshees were trying to rig the vote.
Back at the ranch, there came a more devious plot to make the county's non-Rajneeshee residents so sick that
they wouldn't be able to vote. As a dry-run for poisoning the water supply before the election, said Maclain, ""They
put salmonella in the salad bars of 10 [local] restaurants; 700 people got sick. Then the [Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention] got involved and they backed off [from the poison water plan]."" No Rajneeshees made it
onto the commission.
""That whole episode with the poisoning - it showed the extreme nature of some of the people there,"" the former anch resident said. She and her family left the ranch after eight days, but her husband went back - until he got sick
and returned home to Long Island.
""I feel like he was experimented upon,"" she said of her now-former spouse. ""I think possibly . . . they were trying to
see [how] their germ warfare . . . would affect someone.""
BY early 1985, things were unraveling. One Rajneeshee disciple burned down the Wasco County Planning Office,
where there were said to be documents related to a real-estate investigation against the cult.
Silverman orchestrated a botched poisoning of Bhagwan's physician, believing the doctor was keeping the guru
addicted to drugs. And then there was the planned, but never attempted assassination of Charles Turner, a US
attorney investigating illegal activity on the ranch.
That fall, Bhagwan escaped to India via Learjet, but Immigration and Naturalization Service agents arrested him in
Charlotte, NC, during a refueling stop. He was charged with immigration fraud (stemming, in part, from a series of
sham marriages conducted to gain citizenship for non-American Rajneeshees). Negotiating a suspended sentence,
he agreed to stay out of the US. He changed his name to Osho and died in 1990, in India, at age 58.
Today, the Antelope property is a Christian camp, but Bhagwan's teachings live on with Osho International, which
has nearly 2.5 million Facebook followers. Maclain said celebs still believe: ""Will Smith's children Instagrammed
about him, and Madonna says that Americans missed the value of him.""
Silvertooth disagrees. Referring to Bhagwan's stint in Antelope, he said, ""When it ended, it was like hearing, 'Your
cancer has been cured, sir.' ""

Bank of America,Sloan comp drama Wells Fargo turmoil," Mar 16, 2018",0,"Here's one bank bigwig who seems to be feeling the heat.
On Thursday, Wells Fargo Chief Executive Tim Sloan blasted months-old comments from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (DMass.)
and defended a 35 percent pay raise for his work in 2017 - even as major investors are weighing whether to
block his compensation.
Sloan, whose bank underperformed all but one rival in 2017, defended a proposed $17.5 million pay package for his
work last year - when the bank was rocked by additional sales scandals and the Federal Reserve took an
unprecedented step to limit its growth.
Sloan also went out of his way to slam Warren, a frequent critic of Wall Street, for her comments five months ago
that he should resign.
""It's not surprising I disagree with almost everything Elizabeth Warren says,"" he told reporters in Detroit, according
to Reuters. ""Most of her comments are both ill-informed and inappropriate.""
New York state Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli is not a fan of the plan to give Sloan a raise.
""Given Wells Fargo's multiple scandals and governance failures, a pay cut would be more deserving than a raise,""
DiNapoli said in a statement.
Sloan's complaints come as shareholders of the embattled bank are considering blocking his compensation when
they vote next month at Wells' annual meeting.
New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who controls the city's pension, which owns more than $600 million in
Wells Fargo shares, is weighing a vote against Sloan's comp, a spokesman told The Post.
Last year's shareholder meeting was an extended circus of angry shareholders who demanded the board resign in
the wake of the fake-accounts scandal the previous fall.
Wells Fargo opened at least 3.5 million bogus accounts in order to pad its bottom line.
The scandal led to the resignation of its then-CEO John Stumpf and brought to light a host of other shady sales
practices, including forced auto insurance and hiking prices on mortgages.
""This is a consequence of when you run essentially a mob operation,"" Bruce Marks, CEO of the Neighborhood
Assistance Corporation of America, told The Post. ""The don gets paid very well."" Marks, who was thrown out of last year's meeting for refusing to stop speaking , said he plans on rallying other
investors to block Sloan's pay package."
Bank of America,Post Focus on Commercial Real Estate Sixth making sense Businesses hot for famed NYC corridor in '17," Mar 13, 2018",1,"Big Six - the Sixth Avenue/Rockefeller Center submarket - is king of Manhattan office leasing for the second year in
a row. If dry statistics make you doze off, a short stroll along the teeming boulevard should perk you up like a dose
of Adderall.
Retail and residential energy are palpable from Franklin Street to Central Park South, but Sixth Avenue's marquee
drag runs from 40th to 59th streets - home to major hotels, Radio City Music Hall and the grand sweep of office
towers lovingly shown at the beginning of Woody Allen's ""Manhattan.""
That panorama, shot in 1979, looks very incomplete today, lacking One Bryant Park and other new skyscrapers. Cushman &Wakefield data cited by the Avenue of the Americas Association show that for all of 2017, Sixth Avenue
leasing outpaced any other major Manhattan avenue or cross-street - a total 3.27 million square feet, up nearly 42
percent from 2.31 million square feet in 2016.
By comparison, the second-highest leasing volume was recorded on Tenth Avenue, which saw 1.66 million square
feet - the bulk of it in new and redesigned buildings at Related Companies/Oxford's Hudson Yards and at
Brookfield's Manhattan West.
In the Sixth Avenue/Rock Center district's 41 million square feet - a total second only to the Grand Central District's
43.5 million square feet - overall vacancy in the fourth quarter of 2017 fell to 9.6 percent from 10 percent a year
earlier. Average asking rents were a solid $85.36. Class-A ""asks"" were $86.68.
The narrow difference between the overall ask and the class-A ask reflects a simple fact that defines Sixth Avenue:
Nearly all its office space is Class A. (By comparison, according to Cushman, the average ask for all of Midtown
was $76.94 for the fourth quarter, versus $83.57 for Class-A space - a gap reflecting a much higher volume of older,
obsolescent space than exists along Sixth Avenue.
Among 2017's largest new leases: Mizuho Americas added 270,000 square feet at 1271 Sixth, the former Time
&Life building, on top of 141,000 it took there earlier in the year.
Bank of America committed to leasing the HBO Building's entire 366,000 square feet at 42nd Street when HBO
moves out. Deloitte grabbed 98,000 square feet at Rockefeller Group's 1221 Sixth Ave. while keeping its 430,000-
square-foot headquarters at Tishman Speyer's 30 Rock.
Monster renewals were led by AllianceBernstein's 992,000 square feet at Fisher Brothers' 1345 Sixth Ave.,
Cushman found. The largest renewal-plus-expansion deal was by 21st Century Fox, with more than 790,000 square
feet at Ivanhoé Cambridge and Callahan Capital Partners' 1211 Sixth Ave.
Sixth Avenue stands apart from neighboring subdistricts in several ways. Times Square's 2000-era quartet at 42nd
Street is younger and more modern, but swamped by hordes of costumed Elmos and tourists.
Although many Sixth Avenue towers date from the 1970s and '80s, they're more modern than many in East
Midtown. The once-premier zone north of Grand Central is finally on the mend thanks to recent rezoning and to
three great, rising projects - One Vanderbilt, 390 Madison Ave. and 425 Park Ave.
To stay competitive, Sixth Avenue landlords are collectively spending hundreds of millions of dollars on new
infrastructure, lobbies and public amenities."
Bank of America,READY TO SHOCK Hernandez out to put LIU Brooklyn on the map," Mar 12, 2018",1,"WHEN you earn your invitation to the Big Dance and you are New York City's team, your legs don't turn to jelly
when you draw Radford on Tuesday night in Dayton ... and your knees don't even knock when you learn that
Villanova will be waiting for you in Pittsburgh on Thursday should you survive and advance.
""I want to pretty much put us on the map,"" Joel Hernandez was saying Sunday night in an office outside the LIU
Brooklyn WRAC Center Gym.
""I feel like not a lot of people in America know about us. I pretty much want to shock everyone and show them that
we're a good team, we can compete with any of the best teams out there."" Shock the world?
""Yeah."" Hernandez is a 6-foot-3 redshirt senior guard from Teaneck, N.J. and the best player on a fearless
Blackbirds team that believes it is peaking at the right time.
For Hernandez, this is a moment to treasure, because to get here, he was forced more than once to stop at the
intersection of Devastation Drive and Heartbreak Highway.
There was a dislocated thumb suffered in the 2016 opener that cost him the season.
""I just looked at it and I couldn't look at it, like I had to look away really quickly,"" Hernandez said.
""So then after that, we went to the hospital and they did X-rays and stuff like that. And then the next day they let
me know that I was gonna have to get surgery.
""I was in class so I just went outside the class and I started crying 'cause I was so devastated 'cause I didn't want
to sit out that year."" It is why, after carrying the Blackbirds to their NEC Tournament upset of Wagner with a
dominant 32-point performance, he tweeted:
I FAILED, I CRIED, I WON, I LOST, I PRAYED, I PUSHED, I WORRIED, I LEARNED, I DISAPPOINTED, BUT I NEVER
QUIT!! ""Ever since my freshman year, I've been having a lot of up-anddown emotions,"" Hernandez said. ""I feel like
freshman year ... I shoulda played a lot more. I was frustrated at times, but I still stayed the course. I stayed
believing in God, having faith in God.
""Even last year, when I got hurt, I was so devastated I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was mad 'cause that
summer before I put in so much hard work getting ready for the season and I felt like all that went to waste when I
got injured and I couldn't play. So for the first couple of months I was really sad, but with the help of my family,
they really taught me just keep faith in God and now look at me, I'm a champion now. So I feel like everything
happens for a reason."" But some things that happen, you struggle force you to struggle to find a reason.
Calvin Chamberlain worked with John Hernandez, Joel's father. Joel met him when he was 8 or 9. He became
Joel's godfather.
""He did a good job of putting the basketball in my hands at an early age when my dad wasn't able to,"" Hernandez
said.
""Always positive, always wanted to look out for somebody, it didn't matter who it was, not just me, it could have
been a random person on the street, he just had a good heart,"" Hernandez said. ""He always wanted to make sure
my head was on straight. He didn't even really care about the basketball, he just wanted me to use basketball to
get an education. When I signed to LIU it was very important to me, 'cause I wanted to get an education for him,
basically that's what he wanted me to do."" Chamberlain suffered a fatal heart attack in his sleep when Hernandez
was a freshman at Teaneck High School. Hernandez will carry the memory of his godfather to Dayton with him.
""He would be proud,"" Hernandez said.
His father, a bank manager, helped drive his son to this dream season.
""My dad would take me to the gym every day before he would go to work,"" Hernandez said. ""So we would have to
go at 5 in the morning so he could have time to get ready and go to work. So it would be just me and my dad in the
gym in the morning. I just wanted to make sure I was prepared for this upcoming season the best way possible. I'm
glad it paid off."" Hernandez typifies this team.
""On the court I'm hungry,"" he said. ""I feel like I have stuff to prove so when I get on the court I like to show people
what I'm capable of doing. Just in case I had any doubters out there, I just want to prove them wrong and stuff like
that."" Now go and shock the world.

Bank of America,ALL WET On-camera 'Bachelor' breakup casts veteran show in unrosy light," Mar 7, 2018",1,"Congratulations, ABC. You did it.
After delivering one of the most controversial ""Bachelor"" finales in franchise history - in which star Arie Luyendyk
Jr. blindsided fiancée Becca Kufrin, dumping her in a 30-minute span of raw, unedited footage - America's Network sunk to a new low in order to deliver season-high ratings.
Bravo, Mike Fleiss, for producing this mess. Are you making room in your bank account for a big bonus check?
At the end of every season, Bachelor Nation is promised the ""most dramatic"" conclusion ever from host Chris
Harrison.
And while the ""Bachelor"" brain trust certainly delivered Monday night, it was at the cost of nauseating a fan base.
We're used to brutal breakups and cringe-worthy confrontations.
Who could forget Season 13's Jason Mesnick ending his engagement to Melissa Rycroft as the cameras rolled
during the ""After the Final Rose"" special in 2009? But capturing the tense final moments between Luyendyk and
Kufrin crossed a line.
Don't get me wrong - fans of reality TV love a juicy storyline.
Heck, it was hard to give up watching Bravo's ""Vanderpump Rules"" in real time this year once the ""Bachelor""
premiered in January. But following the elimination of a vapid villainy midway through the competition, Luyendyk's
already snooze-worthy season lost even more luster.
As the final weeks approached, rumors surfaced Luyendyk would jilt his final pick in favor of the runner up. And
with ABC promoting a five-hour, two-night event ahead of Monday night's season finale, it was apparent fans were
in for a treat.
What they received, however, was something else entirely.
With a crew documenting Luyendyk breaking Kufrin's heart, viewers didn't miss a sigh or tear - thanks in part to
dual screens, which eliminated tiresome camera pans.
Though nothing is sacred where reality TV is concerned, watching someone get their future ripped away for the
sake of salvaging a lost season is not only doing a disservice to an already embattled franchise - looking to move
forward following a summer scandal with ""Bachelor in Paradise"" - but to loyal viewers as well.
Bachelor Nation may not root for everyone on the show, but Kufrin was a fan favorite going into the finale, and
audiences did not want to see someone they connected with get hurt. And while she may have signed her life away
by joining the show, she didn't ask for her personal heartache to become an embarrassing primetime spectacle,
either.
For a franchise that's long been criticized for manipulating contestants in the hopes of delivering real drama, this
ratings ploy feels like a low blow for a show that prides itself on creating a modern-day fairy tale.
And while some love stories don't always have happy endings - as audiences have seen with ""Bachelor"" couples
time and time again - the same can be said for TV shows that disgust their viewers one too many times."
Bank of America,Amazon weighs move into checking," Mar 6, 2018",1,"Amazon may soon find yet another way into its customers' wallets.
The e-commerce behemoth is reportedly chatting with big banks about creating a ""checking account-like product""
for its customers.
Details on the effort are scarce, but the talks hint that there is no industry that Amazon isn't willing to disrupt.
Fresh off its acquisition of Whole Foods in August, Amazon has made moves to build its own delivery service that
would rival United Parcel Service and FedEx. Amazon is also weighing entering the health and prescription- drugs
business.
By offering its own checking-account product - or partnering with a bank to offer one - Amazon could minimize transaction fees on its platform.
Amazon's talks with the big banks, which include JPMorgan Chase, are in the early stages. It is possible the
product may never see the light of day, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news.
Capital One Financial has also pitched Amazon on a possible checking account product, the WSJ reported.
""As a matter of practice, we don't comment on market rumor or speculation,"" a spokesperson from Capital One told
The Post.
Reps from Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. JPMorgan declined to comment.
It wouldn't be Amazon' s first foray into the financial sphere. Seven years ago, Amazon launched a lending program
for small businesses that sell on the platform.
Amazon also has a working history with JPMorgan.
Last month, Amazon and the banking giant revealed they are working with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway to
create a company that will lower health-care costs for employees at all three companies."
Bank of America,"Post Focus on Commercial Real Estate JPMorgan's big adventure Bank's foray into the future * JPM will replace tower instead of relocating (m) * JPM's long, strange trip toward its new HQ (s, lcf)"," Mar 6, 2018",0,"After a 10-year quest for a new headquarters tower, JPMorgan Chase is set to replace antiquated 270 Park Ave.
with a much taller and larger skyscraper.
But it's been a long, strange trip for the nation's largest bank, which found itself frustrated several times trying to
establish a new home - illustrating how difficult it is for a huge company with highly specialized needs.
JPMorgan Chase didn't want to leave 270 Park Ave. Jamie Dimon's troops love being close to Grand Central
Terminal, through which many of its top-paid execs and traders pass daily.
The old building, opened in 1959, was designed for an age when Xerox copier machines were the last word in
technology. But under old East Midtown zoning, JPM couldn't replace 270 Park with a new structure even of the
same size.
JPM occupies all or part of 14 buildings in the city, covering nearly 6.5 million square feet in Manhattan - mostly at
245, 270 and 277 Park Ave., 383 Madison Ave. and 28 Liberty St. (the former Chase Plaza, now owned by China's
Fosun.) Not one of them is suitable for JPMorgan's headquarters and trading needs.
""This isn't the 1980s,"" said a real estate dealmaker attuned to the bank's thinking. ""Financial companies of Chase's
size and complexity can't just refurbish a dinosaur and say, 'We can squeeze in a little more fiber-optic cable.' They
need to design their own electronics, sustainability features and redundant systems, which you can only fully do in
a new building.""
The breakthrough came with the rezoning of East Midtown last year. The complicated new rules basically allow
larger new towers to go up in exchange for developers' payments to the city for transit and public-area
improvements.
But before new zoning kicked in, JPM - pressured by competition from Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and other
institutions working out of newer quarters with superior infrastructure - exhausted every option hunting for a
different location.
The first serious try was at 130 Liberty St., the former Deutsche Bank building just south of Ground Zero that was
ruined on 9/11 - but still standing when Dimon announced plans for a new tower there in 2007.
The bank was to pay the Port Authority $290 million for a 99-year ground lease. The tower would have 42 stories
and room for 7,000 employees. ""We're proud of going back home,"" Dimon said - referring to JPM's downtown roots.
To preserve a parcel of ground to be used for a new St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church - a pet project of former
Gov. George Pataki - architect Gene Kohn of Kohn Pedersen Fox had to cantilever six trading floors above the church site.
The protruding floors quickly caused the design to be dubbed the ""beer-belly tower"" in The Post. Kohn said he
might slim the ""midriff bulge."" But a thornier problem was that the PA and the Lower Manhattan Development
Corp. couldn't take down 130 Liberty St. after a fatal fire in August 2007 brought demolition to a halt.
As JPM honchos grew antsy over the delay, they caught a break in early 2008 when they picked up the remains of
Bear Stearns in a $237 million fire sale - including the collapsed investment bank's 383 Madison Ave.
headquarters, a relatively modern structure equipped with the needed trading floors.
It appeared to solve at least some of JPM's problems, so the bank dropped its 130 Liberty St. plan. But even
newish buildings grow old quickly in the digital age. Dimon gradually discovered that 383's trading floors weren't
getting it done the way trading floors were doing for BofA at One Bryant Park.
In the summer of 2013, Dimon sold downtown's Chase Plaza - part of a reevaluation of the bank's real estate
needs, which once again included the search for a new HQ.
Dimon ""kicked tires"" at Brookfield's Manhattan West and Vornado's Pennsylvania Hotel site. He also considered
relocating its trading operations to Stamford, Conn., where UBS was planning to unload on the cheap the world's
largest trading floor - 100,000 square feet
Although a bank rep told The Post in 2014, ""No decision has yet been made to move from 270 Park,"" Dimon settled
on a destination: two new skyscrapers planned at Related Companies' Hudson Yards. One would be an 1,100-foottall
giant at 504-522 W. 34th St., where Coach Inc. owned the land but would sell it to Related once Coach moved
to its own new digs at 10 Hudson Yards. The second would be at the rising structure now known as 50 Hudson
Yards, future home of BlackRock.
But City Hall balked at JPM's request for $1 billion in subsidies for the $6.5 billion development. The proposal died
in October 2014. Afterward, speculation ran rampant about Dimon's intentions.
Some scenarios seemed far-fetched. In December 2016, the Wall Street Journal reported that SL Green, which was
about to start work on One Vanderbilt, had offered the exasperated bank a swap - it would give JPM the new
skyscraper in exchange for 270 Park Ave. and 383 Madison Ave.
But Dimon patiently waited out the rezoning. The terms worked out by former Planning Commissioner Carl
Weisbrod and his successor, Marisa Lago, incorporating input from area ""stakeholders,"" at last gave JPM the
flexibility it needed.
The new tower will stretch 500 feet closer to heaven than its current HQ. No architect has yet been chosen. The
bank is gobbling up air rights from neighboring sites and hopes to begin demolition early next year.
Some architects and preservation groups are howling for retroactive landmark status for 270 Park Ave. - which the
city's Landmarks Preservation Commission declined to do in the past. Such a step would sabotage the project for
good. But with any luck, and if reason prevails, Dimon will finally get to build the trophy that's eluded him for 10
long years.
n A new tenant is coming to Fisher Brothers' 299 Park Ave. - Traxys Group, which signed for 29,771 square feet.
Traxys, a commodity trader-merchant in metals and natural resources, will move next year from 825 Third Ave.
The signing brings 299 Park Ave. to 85 percent leased.
The tower will begin a major capital improvement program this year.
A CBRE team repped Traxys. Newmark Knight Frank and a Fisher Brothers in-house team repped the landlord."
Bank of America,Chase going 390 Mad," Mar 2, 2018",0,"JPMorgan Chase, led by CEO Jamie Dimon, has signed a lease for 436,905 square feet at L&L Holding's 390

Previously known as 380 Madison, the new address reflects that the structure was ""re-massed"" on the bones of the

""These politions [sic] won't listen to us so maybe the'll [sic] listen to the billion dollar tourism industry in FL.""
An estimated 1.5 million students go on spring break in Florida each year, spending more than a billion dollars on
transportation, hotels, restaurants and shopping.
By late afternoon, Hogg's spring-break boycott tweet had collected 50,000 likes, and he expanded on his
recommendation.
""Better Idea: Spend your spring break in Puerto Rico, it's a beautiful place with amazing people. They could really
use the economic support that the government has failed to provide,"" he tweeted.
Reaction was swift.
""Threatening the livelihood of the ppl of Florida who rely on those tourism dollars?"" tweeted @Istillwantapony,
calling Hogg ""a righteous, privileged, foolish, extremist.""
Former New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, a supporter of both Puerto Rico and gun control,
applauded.
""On behalf of myself, my mother who lives on the island &the millions of us living here &in #PuertoRico, gracias for
expression of solidarity,"" she tweeted. ""Keep kicking ass."" Snowbirds, too, were on board.
""I like many Canadians travel to Florida from time to time to escape our winter,"" said Wendy Glaab, 60. ""I can't
speak for others, but I will not be returning until meaningful gun-control legislation is in place.""
Meanwhile, by early Sunday, at least 15 companies, including car rentals, insurers and hotel chains, had severed
ties to the NRA.
On Saturday, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines announced on Twitter their decisions to no longer offer discounted
fares to NRA members to attend the association's annual meetings.
The corporate exodus began late Thursday, when First National Bank of Omaha promised to stop issuing NRA Visa
cards and Enterprise Holdings said it would end discounts for NRA members. Enterprise Holdings owns the
Enterprise, Alamo and National car-rental companies.
By Friday, Hertz, Avis and Budget had also stopped discounts, as did the Best Western hotel chain and Symantec
Corp., which had offered members discounts on its LifeLock identity-theft program.
Insurance giant MetLife and TrueCar, a car-buying service, have also pulled their discounts.
The NRA on Saturday accused defectors of ""a shameful display of political and civic cowardice,"" and said the loss
of a discount ""will neither scare nor distract one single NRA member.""
Additional NRA breakups may be in the offing.
Tens of thousands of people as well as gun-control advocate groups including Sleeping Giants and Moms Demand
Action for Gun Sense in America have begun urging AppleTV, Google, Amazon.com and Roku to stop carrying
NRATV.
Hogg joined Sleeping Giants, Guns Down America and other groups in additionally targeting FedEx for offering
shipping discounts to NRA members.

Bank of America,"PostScript; Books Pretty evil As France struggled through WWII, this American beauty collaborated with Nazis to live a life of luxury"," Feb 25, 2018",0,"All she ever wanted was her very own literary salon - and she didn't care if she had to turn traitor to get one.
Florence Gould, the ""Queen of the Riviera,"" was a flapper fashion plate and a Depression-era trend-setter who
parlayed her husband's inherited fortune into a chain of casino pleasure palaces throughout France. American by
birth but French to the tips of her manicured fingers, the green-eyed beauty cultivated a vast network of friends
and lovers that included some of the biggest names of her day, including Charlie Chaplin, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Coco
Chanel and Maurice Chevalier.
She was also a blithe Nazi collaborator who tried to launder ill-gotten wealth for Hitler's regime and ran a Paris
prostitution ring to pleasure German occupiers during World War II. She added ""ownerless"" art masterpieces
confiscated from Jewish connoisseurs to her exquisite art collection. And after the Third Reich's defeat, Gould's
status helped absolve her war crimes - as the international jet set politely looked the other way.
In her new book ""A Dangerous Woman"" (St. Martin's Press), out now, Susan Ronald traces Gould's amoral life and
high-flying times.
Born in San Francisco in 1895 to French immigrant parents, Florence Lacaze fled the West Coast with her mother
and younger sister after the 1906 earthquake leveled the city by the Bay. They settled in Paris to live in genteel
poverty, leaving Florence's newspaper-editor father behind.
She grew up coveting a place in the salons of Paris, regular gatherings of artists and writers ruled by the city's
wealthiest, wittiest women. In 1918, as a scantily clad chorus girl in the famous Folies Bergère, she schemed to
reel in a rich husband who would help her join that upper crust.
Enter Frank Jay Gould, youngest son of American robber baron Jay Gould, whose share of his family's estate would
be worth about $4 billion today. When they wed in 1923, they agreed that neither would give up their extracurricular sexual dalliances, forming an
early open marriage. ""Everybody slept with everybody else,"" Florence Gould would say decades later. ""It was fun. It
was practical.""
As business partners, they launched a hotel and casino after spending a winter on the French Riviera. The Goulds
chose the sleepy village of Juan-les-Pins, located between Cannes and Monte Carlo on the Mediterranean coast.
The Hotel Provencale, a lavish 256-bedroom Art Deco palace, immediately drew a chic crowd of entertainers,
artists and writers. Rudolph Valentino, Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Mary
Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks all gambled and lounged there.
Florence Gould reveled in playing host. Chanel designed special ""beach pajamas"" for her that set a fashion trend in
1926. Tennis great Suzanne Lenglen gave her lessons. An intense love affair with Chaplin ended in an offer to star
in his next film - which she turned down, unwilling to leave Frank and his fortune.
""It's true, it's true, I love money,"" she confessed. By the end of the 1930s, the Goulds' empire encompassed 50
hotels, casinos, spas and hundreds of cafes across France.
In Paris, she carried on simultaneous affairs with the American ambassador to France, William Bullitt, and with
Otto Abetz, a Nazi spy. Between them, she was well aware that the continent would soon explode into war.
Yet the Goulds remained in Europe. Escaping to America would force them to cough up millions in unpaid taxes.
France fell to Germany in 1940, and Hitler's troops occupied Paris and much of the country for four years of horror
and hardship. Nearly 80,000 French Jews were deported to Nazi death camps; many more were persecuted, their
property seized. Resistance fighters risked all to undermine the Axis powers. Ordinary citizens endured travel bans,
food shortages and fuel rationing.
Not Florence Gould. Elegant and still beautiful at 45, she used sex and charm as her currency, trading them for
favors and luxuries that let her sail through the war years unscathed.
She slept with Helmut Knochen, the city's top Gestapo commander, and entertained his boss Carl Oberg, the
notorious SS and police leader. The head of the city's Abwehr, or military-intelligence service, was another of her
lovers. She was devoted to Ludwig Vogel, a black marketeer and undercover SS agent.
Her new friends-with-benefits tipped her off to auctions where she bid against Hitler's own art dealers to acquire
works that had been looted from Jewish collectors. She snapped up Impressionist and modern canvases deemed
too ""degenerate"" for the Fuhrer's tastes.
With influential fashion editor Marie-Louise Bousquet, Gould set up the ""souris gris"" - gray mouse - prostitution
network. Their ""mice,"" former society women, served as high-class call girls for the Nazi leadership in exchange for
black-market goods.
The occupiers provided all Gould needed to shrug off the war's indignities: unlimited gasoline and travel passes
that let her visit her husband, still in the Riviera, whenever she wished; truckloads of coal to keep her warm while
the rest of Paris shivered; even an exemption from the 1942 round-up of expatriate American women that sent hundreds of them to an internment camp for months.
With the treats the Nazis allowed her, she achieved her girlhood dream of establishing a trend-setting literary
salon, enticing prospective guests with real coffee, gourmet chocolates and roast beef.
In 1944, as the successful D-Day invasion foretold an Allied victory, Gould joined a Nazi money-laundering scheme
meant to funnel over a billion francs of ill-gotten wealth out of Europe before Hitler's defeat. She fronted a new
bank, set up in neutral Monaco, to provide a safe haven for funds that Nazi fugitives could use to start new
postwar lives.
US authorities froze the assets - and launched a treason probe into Gould's actions. But through four years of
review by French and American investigators, she played the victim, insisting that she only went along with the
plot when the Nazis threatened to send her beloved Frank to the camps. A French court ruled in 1948 that her
criminal complicity could not be proven.
""I have slept with the Dear Lord, and the Dear Lord loves me,"" as she liked to say.
After the war, her weekly salon rolled on, its dark origins conveniently forgotten by Salvador Dali, André Gide, Jean
Cocteau and other guests. She became a generous philanthropist, gifting two rare medieval tapestries and ""The
Terrace at Vernonnet,"" a painting by modernist master Pierre Bonnard, to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.
By the time of her death in 1983, at age 88, Gould owned an $8 million collection of jewels, including the fabulous
31.35-carat Victory Diamond and a spectacular three-strand pearl necklace that had been her signature accessory.
Her 180 artworks, including paintings by van Gogh, Renoir, Degas and Monet, sold at auction for $34 million in
1984.
The cash established the Florence Gould Foundation, a New York-based nonprofit that continues to fund artistic
and cultural programs.
Today, the Bonnard hangs in a gallery named in Gould's honor at the Met on Fifth Avenue. The French Institute
Alliance Francaise's Florence Gould Hall on East 59th Street, a film and theater venue, is another legacy.
Florence Gould herself is interred in the Gould family mausoleum at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, a miniature
Parthenon guarded by a weeping beech that the Parks Department has enshrined as one of 65 official ""Great Trees
of New York City.""
""Florence was une originale . . . someone you could love and dislike in equal measure,"" Ronald concludes. And, in
the end, a New Yorker, like her or not.

Bank of America,Whale of a pay gap for Barclays women," Feb 23, 2018",1,"One of the biggest banks on Wall Street on Thursday has unveiled an eye-popping pay gap.
Barclays, run by Chief Executive Jes Staley, pays its female investment bankers about half of what it pays men in
the same unit - underscoring the lack of women in senior positions.
On average, Barclays female investment bankers make 48 percent of what their male counterparts do, the
company said in its annual report on Thursday.
UK banks, under a new law, are required to disclose pay disparity.
The report also shows that there's a shrinking number of women in top roles, including managing directors and
board members, since last year.
Staley, in the report, said he was ""confident"" men and women got paid equally for the same job but that the bank
has to continue to push to get more women into higher-level jobs.
Staley said it was the bank's goal to increase female representation on Barclays' board from 21 percent today to 33
percent by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of associates, the lowest-level bankers, are women, while assistant vice presidents, one step up,
are only 38 percent women, the bank said.
Managing directors, the highest level, are just 15 percent female.
US banks, like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, have yet to report their data on pay. They have until April to
make the disclosures.
Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo have all reported that they pay women 99 cents for every dollar they
pay men - however, the banks haven't released their methodology, and skeptics have questioned those
proportions.
HERE'S THE SCOOP:
n Only 15% of managing directors are women.
n Women account for 58% of low-level associates but only 38% of assistant VPs."
Bank of America,Wagamama noodles around Midtown," Feb 23, 2018",0,"Asian noodles eatery Wagamama is curling its way around two high-profile Midtown office towers - Fisher
Brothers' 1345 Sixth Ave. and 605 Third Ave.
Wagamama has signed leases totaling 14,000 square feet for its third and fourth Manhattan locations.
And, sure to please many New Yorkers fed up with redundant ATMs, both restaurants will move into space formerly
occupied by bank branches.
The larger space is at Sixth and 55th Street in a nearly 2-million-square-foot tower that Fisher is upgrading to the
tune of $65 million. The ongoing project includes a new lobby and new public spaces highlighted by a new,
fountain-centered ""front porch.""
The asking rent for the two-level Wagamama space was $250 per square foot, said Newmark Knight Frank
managing director Jared Lack, who represented the tenant.
London-based Wagamama has about 145 locations around the world. It opened its first New York spot in 2016 at
210 Fifth Ave. in Flatiron, followed by one at 55 Third Ave. in the East Village.
The 15-year lease at 1345 Sixth Ave. is the latest marquee deal on the Avenue of the Americas, where the officeleasing
scene is thriving and retail vacancies are few.
Wagamama USA managing director Burton Heiss termed 1345 Sixth Ave. ""ideal for our New York City flagship."" He
credited Jessica Kalimian, his company's head of real estate, for being ""instrumental in finishing this deal.""
""When Jared Lack proposed the additional opportunity at 605 Third, we ended up with two incredible locations in
premier Midtown buildings,"" Heiss said.
Both Wagamamas are to open next winter and will have outdoor seating."

Milstein paid about $15 million for the magazine and related Web site, sources said. ""If you hang out at the front door of Emigrant Bank in the heart of Midtown Manhattan, you will occasionally see

Financial infidelity is rampant in America.
A poll by a national nonprofit aimed at increasing Americans' financial know-how revealed that nearly two in five
couples cheat on their significant other when it comes to finances.
That's up from one in three a few years ago.
Cheating how? Well, by misleading or lying to each other about household finances and spending in most cases,
according to the National Endowment for Financial Education.
Latinos are the most financially faithful, with just 38 percent of respondents saying they cheat. African Americans
are the biggest cheaters, according to the poll, with 56 percent saying they lie about money. Roughly 40 percent of
whites say they cheat financially.

Bank of America,Feds' pedal to the 'meddle' Mueller hits 13 Russians for waging election 'info warfare'," Feb 17, 2018",1,"The feds dropped a bombshell on the White House Friday, revealing the indictments of 13 Russians - one a close
pal of Vladimir Putin - for sabotaging the presidential election to boost Donald Trump and slime Hillary Clinton.
The Justice Department's stunning announcement alleged that the sophisticated skulduggery began in 2014 and
involved the creation of social-media accounts on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter by more than 80 Russians
working day and night.
The accounts were made to look like they were created by ordinary, grassroots American activists but sought to
sow political and racial discord and disrupt the nation's democracy.
""The defendants allegedly conducted what they called information warfare against the United States with the
stated goal of spreading distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general,"" Deputy Attorney
General Rod Rosenstein told reporters.
""We must not allow them to succeed,"" a stone-faced Rosenstein warned, adding that the case ""serves as a
reminder that people are not always who they appear to be on the Internet.""
Rosenstein said there was no information in the indictment alleging that any Americans contacted by the Russians
were aware of the operation, or that the Russians' efforts determined the election's outcome.
But he stressed that special counsel Robert Mueller's probe was ongoing.
Signed by Mueller, the 37-page, eight-count indictment also charged three businesses.
""By early to mid-2016, defendants' operations included supporting the presidential campaign of then-candidate
Donald J. Trump . . . and disparaging Hillary Clinton,"" the indictment charged.
The feds said the individuals were given $1.25 million a month by a Russian oligarch known as ""Putin's chef,""
Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin through a company known as Concord Catering.
Prigozhin, 56, and Concord Catering are charged in the indictment, as is another Prigozhin company, Concord
Management and Consulting.
The feds said the Russians even taunted the US by hiring an unsuspecting American to stand in front of the White
House on May 29, 2016 - Prigozhin's birthday - holding a sign that said, ""Happy Birthday Dear Boss.""
Prigozhin scoffed at the charges.
""The Americans are really impressionable people. They see what they want to see. I greatly respect them. If they
want to see the devil - let them see him,"" he told Russian media.
The Russians also hired another clueless American to attend rallies dressed as Clinton in a striped prison suit
while sitting on a flatbed truck in a cage.
On social media, they created pages with such names as Blacktivist, United Muslims of America and Army of
Jesus that spread inflammatory disinformation about Clinton,
The United Muslims page, for example, accused her of favoring Sharia law.
Another page, called Woke Blacks, urged African-Americans not to vote - an effort to hurt the Democrat at the polls.
""A particular hype and hatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote for Killary. We cannot
resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we'd surely be better off if we did not vote at all,"" one post read.
One typical ad they placed on social media in September 2016 read, ""Hillary is a Satan, and her crimes and lies had
proved just how evil she is.""
A Twitter account linked to the Russians claimed to be from Tennessee Republicans. A number of American
politicians, celebrities and journalists shared the bogus group's tweets. Among those who retweeted posts from @Ten_GOP were ex-National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, Trump crony
Roger Stone, rapper Nicki Minaj, actor James Woods and conservative columnist Ann Coulter.
Facebook and Twitter took heat from the feds for failing to quickly spot the phony Russian accounts. The socialmedia
giants acknowledged only last fall that they had been duped.
""The nature of the scheme was the defendants took extraordinary steps to make it appear that they were ordinary
American political activists,"" Rosenstein said.
The third indicted company, Internet Research Agency - a ""troll farm"" based in St. Petersburg - ""had a strategic goal
to sow discord in the US political system, including the 2016 US presidential election,"" the indictment said.
In a related action, it was disclosed that a California man, Richard Pinedo, 28, pleaded guilty this month to using
stolen identities to set up bank accounts that were used by the Russians.
Friday's indictment charges all of the defendants with conspiracy to defraud the US and three others with
conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, and five defendants with aggravated identity theft.
None of the Russians was arrested, and Russia was not expected to hand them over. Still, they cannot visit the US
without risking arrest and could face arrest if caught on an ally's soil.
Trump cast the indictment as a vindication of himself.
""Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President. The results
of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!"" he tweeted en route to
his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla.
Trump added in a statement that ""far-fetched theories"" about collusion in the 2016 election ""only serve to further
the agendas of bad actors, like Russia.""
""It's time we stop the outlandish partisan attacks. We must unite as Americans to protect the integrity of our
democracy and our elections,"" he added.
Moments after the indictments were released, Trump's campaign sent out an e-mail seeking donations to fight
""fake news.""
""America is waking up to the fake news. We're waking up to the lies liberals have been feeding our country for
decades. We are still fighting to take our country, and we will not rest,"" the mass e-mail read.
The indictments are the most significant development in Mueller's ongoing probe into Russian meddling.
Trump has repeatedly dismissed charges that Russia interfered in the election, calling it a ""hoax"" and ""fake news"" -
despite agreement among the US intelligence community that Russia interfered to help him in his race against
Clinton.
Campaign of deception
Highlights of the Justice Department's indictment:
n Disinformation campaign began in April 2014 and continued through - and after - the presidential election in
November 2016.
n The campaign was run by the Internet Research Agency of St. Petersburg, Russia, employing more than 80
people on graphic, search-engine optimization, data analysis, finance and information technology. The
budgetexceeded $1.25 million a month by September 2016.
n 13 individuals and three companies charged.
n Yevgeniy Prigozhin (left) was accused of using companies he controlled,including Concord Management and
Consulting and Concord Catering, to finance the operation. He has been called ""Putin's chef"" because his
restaurants host dinners between Vladimir Putin and foreign dignitaries.
n The Russians were advised by an unsuspecting activist ""that they should focus their activities on 'purple states
like Colorado, Virginia and Florida.'""
n Russians used the stolen identities of Americans to post misinformation on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and
Twitter, drawing hundreds of thousands of followers to their fake accounts. Those included accounts called
Secured Borders and United Muslims for America. One account, called Tennessee GOP, attracted more than
100,000 followers. n Prosecutors say PayPal was used to transfer money for general expenses as well as to buy Facebook ads.
Prosecutors say the accounts were opened using fake identities to help bypass PayPal's security measures.
n Russian misinformation specialists were instructed to ""use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest
(except Sanders and Trump - we support them).""
n Many ads bought by the Russians on social media were intended to depress minority votes. ""Hillary Clinton
doesn't deserve the black vote,"" said one ad posted on May 24, 2016. On Nov. 3, 2016, days before the election, the
Russians bought an ad on their Blacktivist account that said: ""Choose peace and vote for Jill Stein. Trust me, it's
not a wasted vote.""
n The Russians promoted campaign rallies, including after the election on Nov. 12 in New York City, to both
support and oppose Trump. At an August 2016 rally in West Palm Beach, Fla., the Russians paid to build a cage on
a flatbed truck and to hire someone to portray Hillary Clinton in a prison uniform.
n There was no allegation that Americans were ""knowing participants."""

ratchet down the nuclear crisis, Pence ""averted a break with the South Korean government."" Yet ""most Korea

SNAP's real value
The recent Post editorial on work and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) unfortunately
misses the mark (""Stamping Out Dependency,"" PostScript, Feb. 4).
SNAP supports work in important ways. The share of working people relying on SNAP continues to increase. It
helps workers in low-wage jobs put food on the table. SNAP is also tied to better health and lower health-care
expenditures. During 2016 alone, SNAP supported 50,000 private-sector jobs and $5 billion in economic activity in
New York City.
By focusing narrowly on unemployed, working-age adults without children - only 11 percent of New York's
participating households - you miss the bigger picture: Most SNAP recipients are children, seniors, people with
disabilities or people caring for dependents.
They are our neighbors, co-workers and friends. SNAP is an efficient, job-supporting way to provide the nutrition
assistance they need. We urge the federal government to strengthen this vital program.

Kevin Flores' death is a terrible tragedy. I am reviewing current law toward better addressing drivers who have
multiple suspensions from driver-related infractions.
I want safe streets and responsible drivers. In fact, I am the prime legislator who originally drafted and got passed
criminalized license suspensions in New York state.
But I do not believe we should criminalize drivers because of unrelated issues, such as failing to pay their fines or
taxes on time or failing to show up for jury duty.
Those drivers with a pattern of dangerous driving should be held strictly accountable.
Assembly Member Joe Lentol (D-Brooklyn)
A path to poverty I write to thank Seema Verma for her column (""Medicaid Should Be a Path Out of Poverty,"" PostOpinion, Feb. 6).
The expansion of Medicaid is part and parcel of the deliberate expansion of the welfare state, which does not
provide a path out of poverty. It consigns a growing number of Americans to dependence, dysfunction and
despondency.

Bank of America,It's hard to bear Volatile marts in seesaw session end tough week," Feb 10, 2018",1,"The bears haven't come out of hibernation - but they may be stirring just a bit.
Investors white-knuckled themselves through stocks' worst week - capped by a 1000-point swing in the Dow Jones
industrial average on Friday. For the week, the Dow and the S&P 500 fell more than 5 percent - their worst weekly showing since January 2016.
A frantic afternoon rally brought the Dow back from a 486-point hole to close the key index at 24,191 - up 330
points.
""The era of low interest rates is at an end which means the proverbial punch in the punch bowl is leaving the party.
And fast!"" Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG, said in a note.
Wall Street has sold off on concerns that an improving economy will continue to push up wages and force the
Federal Reserve to raise borrowing costs - which can depress corporate earnings.
The past week was one of the most eventful ever for Wall Street, officially ending a winning streak that hadn't seen
a significant pullback since August 2015.
The Dow had its two biggest-ever point drops on Monday and Thursday, in that order.
Even the 560-point gain on Wednesday featured a 1,167-point swing during the session, leaving investors feeling
nauseous.
The upswing on Friday came just one day after US stocks had entered a technical correction, meaning a 10
percent drop from the peak on Jan. 26.
After an eventful day that was deepest in the red by 1:40 p.m., the gains were once again locked in in the last hour
of trading, which saw a nearly 530-point run-up before things levelled off somewhat at the bell.
But even that couldn't save the markets from a historically awful week in which they fell 5.3 percent from the
opening on Monday morning.
That's the worst weekly performance since January, 2016 - when the markets cratered 6.2 percent.
The S&P 500 rose 1.5 percent on Friday, to 2,620, while the Nasdaq gained 1.4 percent, to 6,874.
The recent market rout is the strangest - and most violent - since the start of the Great Recession 10 years ago.
Market watchers attributed some of the swings to complex investments that moved in the opposite direction of
the volatility index - the VIX.
After the VIX - which is also called the ""fear gauge"" - rose by 200 percent on Monday, investors were left totally
wiped out, and some markets were left distorted.
Even with the jarring numbers, Wall Streeters have cautioned that pullbacks are normal and are unlikely to hurt the
economy.
""The equity market sell-off thus far does not alter our outlook for the US economy or monetary policy,"" Bank of
America wrote in a Friday research note.
""However, if it turns into a sustained and broad-based deterioration of financial conditions, it would be a cause of
concern."""
Bank of America,"PHILLY DILLY! Eagles 41, Patriots 33 * U.S. Bank Stadium * Minneapolis SUPER FOLES Backup QB's magical run ends with Lombardi Trophy, MVP honors"," Feb 5, 2018",0,"MINNEAPOLIS - It is Folesadelphia today, and tomorrow, and for a long, long time.
The home of cheesesteaks, Rocky and Joe Frazier waited 58 years for this night.
Fifty-eight years after Norm Van Brocklin led their Eagles to what had been their most recent NFL championship, a
backup quarterback named Nick Foles stared down Tom Brady and Bill Belichick and fired a green-and-gray
slingshot and hit Goliath right between the eyes.
It ended Eagles 41, Patriots 33, ended with Brady trying a Hail Mary from midfield for Rob Gronkowski in the end
zone. It ended with Philly prayers answered.
It ended with Foles kissing his 8-month-old daughter, Lily, in his arms and kissing his wife Tori and thanking God
and saying: ""To be in this moment is something you dream about as a kid. To be in this moment is something you
dream about as a kid. I am proud to be a Philadelphia Eagle.""
PHILLY. PHINALLY.
It's a torrid love affair now between a humble Texas kid who never wanted to leave Philadelphia and nearly retired
after he was traded and cherished the day he was welcomed back, even if he was now watching Carson Wentz
become the talk of the town.
Then Wentz was suddenly gone, and Philadelphia asked St. Nick to be its long lost savior and make history.
And now only Foles (28-for-43, 373 yards) and Eli Manning have ruined Evil Emperors Brady (25-for-39, 465 yards, 3
TDs) and Belichick on Super Sunday.
Fly, Eagles, fly.
The Rocky statue shed tears of joy when it ended.
Cry, Rocky, cry.
Foles, utterly unfazed by the magnitude of the moment, went toe-to-toe, arm-to-arm, in an epic shootout against
Brady.
Eyeball-to-eyeball with the G.O.A.T. in arguably the G.O.A.T. of Super Bowls.
Threw three touchdown passes and caught another and earned MVP.
""I felt calm. I think the big thing that helped me was knowing that I didn't have to be Superman,"" Foles said.
Except he was.
""I wasn't worried about the scoreboard. I wasn't worried about the time. I was just playing ball,"" Foles said.
He and head coach Doug Pederson fed off each other's fearlessness.
""Whatever Doug called, I was just going to go out there and rip it,"" Foles said.
As hearts raced and throats lumped and America stood mesmerized towards the end, it was Eagles 32, Patriots 26,
and of course Brady yawned.
Hit Danny Amendola for 30 yards and Gronk against Ronald Darby with a 4-yard touchdown pass. Patriots 33,
Eagles 32 with 9:22 left and Pederson was wishing he hadn't attempted a failed two-point conversion in the second
quarter. Pederson, fourth-and-1 at his 45, went for it. Of course he did. And Foles hit Ertz for 2 yards. Then Nelson Agholor
for 10. Then Agholor again for 18. Then Agholor again for 11.
Then Ertz - ruled a runner before the ball hit the ground as he hurtled into the end zone - in an 11-yard TD against a
stumbling Devin McCourty. Eagles 38, Patriots 33 after the failed two-point conversion.
So here was Brady, 2:21 and one timeout left, trailing 38-33, 75 yards from the Lombardi Trophy. And he was stripsacked
by Brandon Graham. Derek Barnett recovered the fumble.
Soon it was Eagles 41, Patriots 33.
Now there stood Brady, 58 seconds and no timeouts left, 91 yards from the Lombardi Trophy.
Hail no!
It had been a wild-and-crazy first half, a wide-open Brady dropping a pass from Amendola, who had taken a pitch
from James White, three plays after Malcolm Jenkins had knocked Brandin Cooks out with a head injury, Keystone
Cops kicking games, and here was Pederson, fourth-and-goal at the 1, ahead 15-12, being the riverboat gambler
again:
A trick play for the ages that maybe only Spygate could have prevented.
A direct snap to Corey Clement.
A pitch to Trey Burton.
A 1-yard TD pass to ... Nick Foles ... NICK FOLES! ... leaking out wide open on the right side.
""We hit it at the right time,"" Foles said.
PHILLY. PHINALLY.

Jackson family still angry at JT over Nipplegate"
Bank of America,"'GREAT' DEBATE Cousins will break bank, but Jets must decide how good he really is"," Feb 1, 2018",1,"BLOOMINGTON, Minn. - Kirk Cousins was seated at a table in the Mall of America food court Wednesday when two
reporters from New York approached.
The Redskins quarterback, who is about to be the hottest free agent in the NFL, politely declined to discuss his
pending free agency or the Jets. As one of the reporters walked away, he said, ""maybe we'll talk in a few months.""
""We'll see,"" Cousins said with a smile.
The agreed-upon trade of Alex Smith to the Redskins on Tuesday night made it clear that Cousins will be a free
agent when the league year begins March 14.
The Jets are expected to be one of several teams that will make a push to sign him. The question will be how big of a push?
Will Woody and Christopher Johnson hand general manager Mike Maccagnan a blank check to sign Cousins?
That would not be like the Jets.
They have not chased big free agents in recent years with the exception of Darrelle Revis in 2015, and that did not
exactly work out.
But the Jets need a quarterback, and Cousins is going to be the big, shiny prize of free agency.
""This comes down to: What is the value?"" former Ravens coach Brian Billick said Wednesday. ""Obviously,
Washington did not want to give Cousins one of those $100 million guaranteed contracts. I don't know if it was
offered to Cousins. I can very easily see if he was offered the [four-year, $94 million] contract Alex Smith was
offered, he thinks he can get more. He might in the open market."" There is no doubt that Cousins is going to
become the highest paid player in NFL history because he is the latest starting quarterback to hit the market.
It has become not about whether the player is ""worth"" the money. It is about where the market is.
The Redskins did not believe in Cousins enough to sign him to a long-term deal, instead using the franchise tag on
him in 2016 and 2017 to pay him $44 million over the two seasons. The Redskins being willing to let him leave as a
free agent has to be a red flag for teams.
A few weeks ago, former Redskins general manager Scot McCloughan told a Denver radio station: ""He's a good
player. Is he special? I don't see special.
But also, we were still building a roster around him to make him special."" Here at the Super Bowl, Eagles backup
quarterback Nate Sudfeld praised Cousins, whom he played with in 2016 in Washington.
""I think the world of Kirk,"" Sudfeld said. ""The guy is a pro's pro, as classy as they get. He always does and says all
the right things. His talent speaks for itself.
He's got incredible arm talent, the way he can speed up his mechanics and get the ball out with quick decisions.""
Speaking to several NFL front office executives on Wednesday about Cousins reveals a belief around the league
that Cousins is a good quarterback who needs a strong team around him to win. He is not viewed as an elite
passer like Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees or Tom Brady, but the belief is a team can win with him.
""There's no question that Kirk Cousins is a capable quarterback,"" Billick said. ""With the Jets, is he the guy?
We'll find out. They're going to have to do a whole lot more than just Kirk Cousins to get that thing back on track.""
That is another part of this equation.
Cousins will have options. Will he want to play for the Jets, who are coming off back-to-back 5-11 seasons and are
entering Year 2 of a rebuild. A team like the Broncos or Jaguars might be more attractive to Cousins because of
the supporting cast.
""Is money a part of it? Sure. Is it the only thing? No,"" Cousins said on Pro Football Talk on Tuesday. ""It's about
winning, and that's what I want more than anything. So I'm going to be willing to make sacrifices or do what has to
be done to make sure I'm in the best possible position to win, and that's what the focus is going to be."" Like
Cousins said, we'll see.

Bank of America,"Super Bowl LII * Sunday * U.S. Bank Stadium * Minneapolis Sittin' pretty 5-time champion Brady far more than just good looking, lucky"," Jan 30, 2018",1,"ST . PAUL - He wore a wool cap and black gloves over both hands, the good one and the healing one, and smiled
the whole way through Super Bowl Opening Night. From here until Super Sunday, Tom Brady will still be America's
Pretty Boy - Father Time hasn't laid a glove on his face, somehow 40-years-old now, much less his golden arm.
But looks are deceiving indeed. Because five times now he has revealed himself as much more than another pretty
face.
Five times he has hoisted the Lombardi Trophy - it would have been seven times were it not for Eli Manning - and
he is relentlessly stalking his sixth.
Because he is a stone-cold assassin.
""It's like he's a shark almost, man, emotionless on the field,"" ex-Giant Osi Umenyiora said. ""He's just like laserfocused,
man. You hit him, he doesn't seem to be affected by it on the field. You've seen him once he goes to the
sidelines react.""
Eagles right tackle Lane Johnson, speaking for all of Philadelphia after the Birds punched their Super Bowl ticked,
has announced: ""Hey, Tom Brady. Pretty boy, Tom Brady. He's the best quarterback of all time, so nothing I'd like to
do more than dethrone that guy.""
Be careful what you wish for.
""I'd hate me too, if I was in Philadelphia right now,"" Brady said.
And there are plenty of other precincts outside of New England that second that emotion.
Where there is both hate and jealousy of Pretty Boy Tom Brady.
For a myriad of reasons, Brady has entered the conversation of most polarizing athletes. He's not quite in a league
with Mike Tyson, Muhammad Ali, Tim Tebow or Tiger Woods, but arguably up there with Michael Jordan, who won
six NBA championships.
And here are five reasons - one for each ring:
1. Deflategate deflated his image, of course it did (cell phone, please).
2. His unconventional TB12 lifestyle isn't what we would have expected from, say, Johnny Unitas ... JU19, anyone?
Joe Namath fueled his system with Johnnie Walker Red, for crying out loud (""I like my girls blonde and my Johnnie
Walker Red."" Nothing about avocado ice cream). To each his own, I guess.
3. Brady doesn't have to be a rebel with a nightlife because he is married to the beautiful Gisele Bundchen.
How many red-blooded American males secretly wish they were Tom Effin Brady?
4. He wins too damn much. When will enough be enough for this guy?
5. He is Belichick's quarterback.
All these years later, he is the Iceman, with a raging fire that burns inside and has never flamed out.
""I always say I think there's a lot of inner drive that I've been very lucky to be born with,"" Brady said.
He was fittingly sitting at podium No. 6.
""Coincidence,"" Brady said.
Someone asked him how to make Belichick smile and Brady paused and said: ""Just say Navy ... lacrosse ... Lawrence Taylor ... Bon Jovi - those four.""
Someone mentioned Adam Sandler starring in ""The Longest Yard,"" and Brady said: ""I love Adam Sandler. Even
though he's a Jets fan.""
His mother grew up in a tiny Minnesota town called Browerville. His parents married there in 1969.
""That really is my roots, and it's very much a part of who I am,"" Brady said. ""My mom lived here for 18 years, and I
was very lucky to come back here every summer, in the winter sometimes. My grandpa lived in that farm. It was a
great experience for a kid from California to have this other part of my life that is so very special.""
He won't have time to visit.
""This trip's all business,"" Brady said. ""I remember the two times we lost - it's just pain. It's just pain.""
Four times he has been Super Bowl MVP. In his last two Super Bowl wins, Brady is 80-for-112 for 774 yards with six
touchdowns and three interceptions (15 touchdowns, five interceptions in his seven Super Bowls).
Pretty Boy on Monday through Saturday.
Assassin on Sundays.

Bank of America,ILLEGAL BRIEFS Readers sound off on controversy Dear John The Answer Man," Jan 28, 2018",1,"Readers: Illegal immigration is certainly a hot-button issue.
Last week I carried a letter from a reader, called SB, who had a staunchly anti-immigration view.
""Babies born here from non-citizen parents are not American citizens and can be thrown out with the parents or
have to be naturalized like any legal immigrant if their parents are here legally,"" said SB.
I invited readers to share their thoughts. Here is a representative sample of the responses.
Dear John: You may not like it but I agree with SB.
Especially everything said about illegal immigrants. They are ILLEGAL so why in hell are they being protected?
Become a US citizen - that is what you are supposed to do! I just don't understand why there is a question - they
have no rights - they don't deserve any rights!
Why are DACA kids eligible for help going to college when we barely get by and my daughter can't get any help and
is going to be broke for the next 15 years trying to pay off her loans?
Just not fair. LD
Dear John: I agree with SB's sentiment on illegals, but I would do it slightly differently.
1. Any person the government can prove is in the US illegally should be removed immediately.
2. Fine employers $10,000 for every illegal on their payroll.
3. Confiscate all property of illegal aliens.
4. Freeze all bank accounts of illegal aliens.
5. Any person who knowingly harbors an illegal alien will have their home subject to forfeiture and face 1 year in
prison.
Dear John: SB came on pretty strong, but his ideas are absolutely on track.
His big picture is right on the money with the details not as easy to achieve.
Totally right about handouts being way too easy and that they take away incentive from people even wanting to
work. And illegals need to [work]. At the very least, [they should] go to the back of the line and definitely be
considered for deportation.
If not, you create a slippery slope and open doors that are almost impossible to close. I have worked and paid
taxes as a proud American-born citizen my whole life and I do not need or want to be subsidizing illegals while paying a fortune in health care even with my employer's help. JP
Dear John: My response to SB: I've always been a firm believer that work input should equal work output.
Obviously our government doesn't believe in this simple equation, with some getting something for nothing.
Dear John: In response to the letter you printed from SB.
My thoughts are quite simple, SB. SPOT ON!! RML
Dear John: Hurrah for the person who wants to stop giving away tax dollars of people who actually work. He
should be governor of NJ! GK
Dear John: SB, you are damned right! JF
Dear John: SB touched on most of the subjects that are avoided in the news. Thanks to SB for his truthful insight,
and to you, John Crudele, for having the guts to print it. It should have been on page 1. JB
Dear John: How come u didn't respond to SB the letter was 99% correct!!! Were u afraid??? DFB
Dear DFB: No, I'm not ""afraid."" In fact, I'll give you my thoughts on immigration in Tuesday's column.
I just thought it would be nice to hear my readers' opinions for a change.
He found his job in The NY Post!
Dear John: Please put me in touch with JM, who said in your column last week that he and other employers had
jobs that they couldn't fill.
I have two unemployed sons who have been out of work for a long time in Nassau and Suffolk counties on Long
Island - one a purchasing manager and the other an electronics engineer. Thanks. PH
Dear PH: OK, I sent your e-mail, and JM, the guy who complained he couldn't find workers, says he might have
something for the engineer son if he is willing to move to South Carolina, where he has a plant. You have each
other's e-mail addresses, so you can take it from here.
Dear John: The world is one large Ponzi scheme - shifting piles of sand from one country to the next only to blow
away in the wind while a few at the top fill their pockets. FM
Dear FM: Wow! Deep.
Let me see if I can match you on this.
In the first place, people who have money usually are able to make more. That really makes perfect sense, since
they are in a better position to take advantage of opportunities, whether in business or with regard to tax law
changes or because they have politicians in their pockets.
Money may not buy happiness, but it certainly buys some amount of security.
A Ponzi scheme is a confidence game - a con. When you look at it like that - yes, the whole world is one big
confidence game.
HOW CAN I HELP?
Dear Readers, Your letters to John Crudele are streaming in fast and furiously, asking Dear John to right the
wrongs you're facing. Because of this influx, The Post Business section will feature more of your inquiries in the
hope of helping you with your troubles."
Bank of America,Lauer's final todays Matt saw handwriting on the wall but remained 'cocky' until the end," Jan 26, 2018",1,"It was Nov. 23, 2017, the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade. Dressed in monochromatic black, a ""gray and tiredlooking""
Matt Lauer was overheard telling a co-worker, ""This is going to be my last parade.""
The noose was tightening around the neck of the ""Today"" show host. Just six days later, America's ""favorite dad""
was unceremoniously ditched by NBC following a ""detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual
behavior in the workplace.""
But while 60-year-old Lauer was resigned to his fate the day of the parade, insiders tell The Post that he fought to
the bitter end. He lied about previous liaisons, repeatedly telling top bosses he had nothing to confess or feel
ashamed about.
Then Lauer admitted only that he'd had three ""consensual"" affairs during his 25 years at ""Today.""
Even now, he struggles to accept that his fall was so swift.
""He goes between sadness and acceptance of his fate, to disbelief how it all happened so quickly and how the
situation was so out of his control,"" says a source close to him.
It was in mid-November, around six weeks after the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke, that years of speculation
about Lauer's ""indiscretions"" were being seriously examined.
According to the NBC source who eavesdropped on Lauer's ominous Thanksgiving parade prediction"", ""He was
already being investigated by Variety magazine, but at that point, nobody knew what they had got on him.
""The Times was calling around, saying they were doing a piece on the culture of the 'Today' show, and The Enquirer
was asking about settlements paid to female staff members who had affairs with Matt.""
During that period, NBC President Noah Oppenheimer and Chairman Andy Lack, Lauer's close friend, and others
approached him ""several times,"" asking, ""Is there anything we should know or be worried about?""
Lauer responded each time, ""I am racking my brains, but I can't think of anything.""
Gossip had dogged Lauer at 30 Rock that he was cheating on his wife of 19 years, former model Annette Roque.
In particular, the rumors focused on a suspected dalliance with ""Today"" contributor Giada De Laurentiis, with whom
the anchor was spotted on a beach in Barbados in 2011. (Both Lauer and De Laurentiis denied an affair.)
But, according to the NBC source, ""Genuinely, nobody at NBC News had any idea at this stage that he was preying
on younger staffers at 'Today.'
""Nobody knew what Matt was doing with the interns and junior producers. It was appalling.""
That all changed after Lauer's first accuser, still employed at NBC, came forward the weekend after Thanksgiving.
A meeting with her lawyers was hastily arranged with Human Resources for 6 p.m. on Monday, Nov. 27.
""She told them she had a sexual relationship with Matt during the Sochi Olympics in 2014, and it continued when
they returned to New York,"" says the insider.
""She was a very junior staff member at the time so there was a clear issue of balance of power.""
The source says the woman provided ""irrefutable evidence"" - speculated to be a naked photograph of Lauer. And
the accuser also claimed ""that she wasn't the only woman he'd done this to.""
The complaint triggered a rapid chain of events, not least because the accuser was represented by renowned civilrights
and employment lawyer Ari Wilkenfeld.
""She had a high-powered attorney from Washington, DC, and so everyone knew if NBC didn't take swift action, they
would have arranged for a sit-down interview with a competitor,"" a second source tells The Post.
Tellingly, in a Nov. 29 statement, Wilkenfeld noted, ""Our impression at this point is that NBC acted quickly, as all
companies should, when confronted with credible allegations of sexual misconduct in the workplace.""
If Lauer had an inkling of the thunderbolt that was about to strike, he didn't show it during his Tuesday, Nov. 28,
appearance on ""Today"" - the morning of his firing.
""He was acting his usual cocky, confident self,"" says the first insider. ""He had no idea that this would turn out to be
his last day on the show.""
Indeed, the anchor was in stitches on-screen, recalling the previous year's holiday tree lighting at Rockefeller
Center, which had been a washout. He even jocularly poked Savannah Guthrie in the arm to make his point as they
perched on the sofa with co-hosts Al Roker, Hoda Kotb and Dylan Dreyer. By that afternoon, however, Lauer, who earned $20 million per year, had lawyered up.
He and an associate of his personal lawyer, William Zabel, sat through a crunch-time meeting with HR executives
and representatives from NBC's legal department. The accusations were leveled about the Sochi episode and other
matters. ""Matt was at first unapologetic, defending himself,"" says the employee close to the situation. ""He claimed
he'd had three consensual affairs in the 25 years at 'Today.' ""
A third source tells The Post, ""They were all much more than a quick f--k.""
However, as the evidence was put to him, his demeanor changed.
""He became quiet and didn't argue,"" adds the first insider. ""He accepted that it didn't look good.""
Both sources revealed that no decision was made about Lauer's future at the meeting.
Instead, he was fired in person that night at his weekday Manhattan apartment in Lenox Hill, where swindler Bernie
Madoff used to live. The messenger? Lauer's one-time pal, Lack.
""It [the atmosphere] was very cold,"" says the third source, who is an acquaintance of Lauer's. But the NBC insider
claims Lack was ""furious"" and called out his behavior as ""reprehensible.""
""Matt, I was told, remained quiet,"" the NBC insider added.
News of Lauer's dismissal was relayed to Kotb and Guthrie at 4 a.m., as they were traveling to 30 Rock in their cars
on their way to work on Wednesday, Nov. 29.
""They were shocked, there were tears, but they had time to work on their opening remarks [to the TV audience]
about Matt,"" says their colleague.
The shock announcement led at least two other women to immediately come forward to NBC with claims similar
to those of the initial accuser. One complaint was from a former employee who said Lauer had sex with her in his
locked office in 2001. She alleged she lost consciousness and woke up on the floor. ""She said she didn't report the
encounter at the time because she felt ashamed and feared losing her job,"" says the second insider.
NBC News declined to comment for this story. Representatives for Lauer did not respond to The Post's requests
for comment, but previously issued a statement in which he expressed his ""sorrow and regret for the pain I have
caused others by words and actions."" He added, ""Some of what is being said about me is untrue or
mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed.""
According to another NBC insider, Lauer was referring to the passed-out woman's claims when he spoke about
untruths.
""Matt didn't deny that because he didn't want to walk through all the allegations,"" the insider said. ""He just felt
there was no point in saying anything, apart from what he said in his statement.""
But a ""Today"" show staffer, who requested anonymity for fear ofbeing fired, went even further in defending Lauer,
blaming the climate of the #MeToo movement.
""What happened with Matt's immediate firing was an unprecedented set of circumstance,"" the staffer said.
""Remember, NBC News spent over a month investigating Brian Williams' 'untruths,' so why, with Lauer, did they
have no other choice but to fire him immediately, with no hearing or investigation?
""NBC News didn't investigate at all. After Matt's 25 years with 'Today,' they simply screamed, 'Off with his head!' ""
Consequently, facing defeat, Lauer retreated to the $36.5 million Hamptons compound he shared with Roque and
their three kids. That was until his wife kicked him out for good, as revealed by Page Six this week. Lauer has
moved into a nearby place so he is on hand for their children, with him and Roque remaining ""cold but cordial,""
sources on Long Island say. The couple was seen arriving separately at their Bridgehampton horse farm earlier this
week.
All this time unemployed has given Lauer a period to reflect. According to the third insider, the veteran newsman is
especially sad that Lack has not spoken to him since the dramatic firing some two months ago.
""Matt is still feeling a lot of shame,"" the insider said. ""But he is angry because he certainly wasn't the only person in
TV doing this, but he has taken the fall.""
He recently told one friend, ""The world is a dark place."""
Bank of America,Crossbow bank heist," Jan 26, 2018",0,"A homeless man held up a Bronx bank with a crossbow on Thursday - and posed as a comic-book hero once cops
caught up to him, police sources said.
""I'm Captain America!"" David Hilton proclaimed, according to the sources.
During the heist at a Bank of America branch on White Plains Road in the Pelham Parkway neighborhood, Hilton
allegedly declared, ""Give me the money,"" before making off with $8,000 at around 10:15 a.m.
Sources said he ditched the crossbow and his clothes later in the day and was eventually caught outside a pizzeria
at Wallace and Astor avenues in Allerton, where he was flashing cash.
Officers from the NYPD's Strategic Response Group took him into custody.
Hilton gave them a phony name before claiming to be Captain America, the sources said.
He's apparently a big fan of the First Avenger - and used the moniker during a previous bust in The Bronx last
week.
It was unclear why Hilton was arrested then, but sources said he was caught up in a domestic incident.
He was to be arraigned for the bank job on Thursday night."
Bank of America,Did 'Escape from Alcatraz' trio incredibly really survive? Puzzle of 'we made it letter' from supposed inmate in '62 breakout," Jan 25, 2018",1,"The fate of three inmates who escaped from San Francisco's Alcatraz prison in 1962 is one of America's greatest
unsolved mysteries.
Their bodies were never found, and the manhunt is still on 56 years later. But could three common crooks really
have survived paddling across the frigid, shark-infested waters surrounding The Rock on a makeshift raft cobbled
together from raincoats?
A newly surfaced letter has reignited hope that the so-crazy-it-just-might-work scheme - made legendary by the
Clint Eastwood film ""Escape from Alcatraz"" - wasn't just a success but that one of the men may still be alive.
""My name is John Anglin. I escaped from Alcatraz in June 1962 with my brother Clarence and Frank Morris. I'm 83
years old and in bad shape. I have cancer,"" reads the letter sent to the San Francisco Police Department in 2013
and aired for the first time by a local CBS affiliate Wednesday.
""Yes, we all made it that night but barely!""
The letter says John Anglin, who would now be 86, lived on the lam in Seattle, North Dakota and now Southern
California. Morris died in 2008 and Clarence Anglin in 2011, it claims.
John says he's reaching out to the feds because he needs a doctor to treat his cancer.
""If you announce on TV that I will be promised to first go to jail for no more than a year and get medical attention, I
will write back to let you know exactly where I am. This is no joke.""
The US Marshals Service says the FBI performed a forensic handwriting analysis on the letter, but the results were
""inconclusive.""
Family members tell The Post it doesn't look like his handwriting - but they do believe all three men survived the
breakout and that John Anglin is still out there.
""The handwriting don't look anything like it. But that's not to say John didn't have somebody else write the letter.
They're pretty intelligent, they know the deal with fingerprints,"" says nephew David Widner, 51.
The marshals say the letter yielded no leads, but the case remains open - even if the agency doesn't seem thrilled
about the possibility that three thieves have evaded their clutches for more than five decades.
""There is absolutely no reason to believe that any of them would have changed their lifestyle and became
completely law-abiding citizens after this escape,"" the agency said in a statement to CBS.
And experts say credible new evidence continues to emerge suggesting that the men survived.
""I definitely believe, with a lot of new evidence that has come to light, that it's possible,"" said Michael Esslinger, a
historical researcher who has penned several books on the escape and has been studying it for decades.
""For the first 20 years as I was doing research, I was very adamant they had died. In the last seven or eight years, I
really changed my opinion.""
It's remarkable enough that small-time bank robbers made it off the famously inescapable island at all - let alone
survived the treacherous swim to shore.
Morris was a career criminal from Washington, DC, who spent his childhood in and out of foster homes and had a
lengthy rap sheet even in his teens.
The Anglins were poor farmers from Florida who had turned to sticking up banks with toy guns.
Morris was a brainiac, according to Esslinger, while the Anglins had learned to be very crafty.
""They grew up with 14 brothers and sisters. They didn't have a lot, so they had to make do with what they had,""
says Widner. ""My mom said they were like MacGyvers.""
Plus, all three were seasoned escape artists and had ended up on Alcatraz precisely because they busted out of
other joints.
In ""Escape from Alcatraz"" Eastwood's Morris is the brains behind the scheme, but Esslinger says it was more of a
team effort between the three - plus a fourth, car thief Allen West, who ultimately failed to escape.
The plan otherwise played out roughly the same as it does in the 1979 film, however, over six months, the men
quietly carved out the ventilation ducts in their cells using spoons and a drill made from a vacuum-cleaner motor
until they could access a utility corridor behind the walls. There, they created a workshop and constructed a raft and life jackets out of pilfered rain jackets - using steam
pipes to seal the seams - and made paddles from scrap wood.
They also made models of their own heads out of soap, toilet paper and hair taken from the prison barbershop to
use as decoys in their beds the night of the break.
Finally on the night of June 11, 1962, the three slipped out - West couldn't get through his duct and was left behind
- and climbed to the prison roof, slid down a smokestack, scaled a fence, inflated their raft with an accordion-like
instrument and set sail for nearby Angel Island.
Thanks to the realistic fake heads, the guards didn't realize what had happened until the next morning. ""If they
made it to the mainland and stole a car, they could've been in Mexico by the time the first bell went off,"" says
Esslinger.
A massive manhunt was mounted, but it failed to find much trace of the fugitives - dead or alive - other than a
paddle and some scraps of life jacket.
Alcatraz officials believed they couldn't possibly have survived the cold, choppy waters, but Widner says the family
has always been sure they made it - and new clues over the past decade have only made them more sure.
""Our family has always believed that they made it,"" he said, noting that the brothers grew up swimming in the icy
waters of Tampa Bay in winter.
""We have a lot inside the family that we haven't shared.""
In 2010, another Anglin brother, Robert, made a deathbed confession to his kin: He'd been in touch with John and
Clarence several times in the first 25 years they were on the run, the family says.
Four years later, Dutch scientists took up the cause and used 3-D modeling of the tides at the time to prove it was
possible they men survived as long as they started paddling between 11 p.m. and midnight.
""In the worst case, the paddling of the escapees is futile . . . the escapees are either swept into the Pacific if they
entered the water before [11 p.m.], or they are pushed deep into the bay and discovered if they enter the water after
midnight,"" wrote researcher Rolf Hut. ""In the best case, the escapees paddle northwards with a speed of almost 1
kilometer per hour, an almost Olympian effort. In that scenario, they most likely survive and make it to the north
side of the Golden Gate bridge.""
In 2015, the History Channel filmed a documentary about the case - with the participation of the family, Esslinger
and the Marshals Service - that yielded several big clues.
The family let investigators dig up the remains of another brother, Alfred, to compare them with bones that washed
ashore in 1983.
The DNA test proved it wasn't an Anglin - shattering what many thought they knew about the case, Esslinger says,
including him. ""I always thought that was a powerful piece of evidence,"" he said.
The Anglins also revealed during the show that in the 1990s, a drug smuggler and family friend told them he'd run
into John and Clarence at a bar in Brazil in the 1970s - and gave them a photo apparently showing the two as
middle-aged men at a farm they'd bought down there.
The Marshals don't think it's legitimate, but a forensic expert on the documentary found it was ""highly likely"" that
they're the same men.
""When you work these types of cases, there's a feeling you get when stuff starts to fall into place,"" Art Roderick, the
retired US marshal who was lead investigator on the case for 20 years and who worked on the documentary, told
The Post at the time.
""I'm getting this feeling now.""
But looking back on the show now, Widner is livid that investigators he worked with never told the family about the
2013 letter - and if his uncle was really out there dying from cancer, he hopes it isn't too late.
""It's inhumane to not let the family know they received a letter, whether it was him or not,"" he said. ""At least we
would have known it could possibly be John reaching out. That upset my mom a lot . . . we would love to get the
word to him that if he would get in touch with us, maybe we could help him."""
Bank of America,FBI is the real scandal," Jan 24, 2018",1,"During the financial crisis, the federal government bailed out banks it declared ""too big to fail."" Fearing their
bankruptcy might trigger economic Armageddon, the feds propped them up with taxpayer cash.
Something similar is happening now at the FBI, with the Washington wagons circling the agency to protect it from
charges of corruption. This time, the appropriate tag line is ""too big to believe.""
Yet each day brings credible reports suggesting there is a massive scandal involving the top ranks of America's
premier law-enforcement agency. The reports, which feature talk among agents of a ""secret society"" and suddenly
missing text messages, point to the existence both of a cabal dedicated to defeating Donald Trump in 2016 and of
a plan to let Hillary Clinton skate free in the classified e-mail probe.
If either one is true - and I believe both probably are - it would mean FBI leaders betrayed the nation by abusing
their powers in a bid to pick the president.
More support for this view involves the FBI's use of the Russian dossier on Trump that was paid for by the Clinton
campaign and the Democratic National Committee. It is almost certain that the FBI used the dossier to get FISA
court warrants to spy on Trump associates, meaning it used the opposition research of the party in power to
convince a court to let it spy on the candidate of the other party - likely without telling the court of the dossier's
political link.
Even worse, there is growing reason to believe someone in President Barack Obama's administration turned over
classified information about Trump to the Clinton campaign.
As one former federal prosecutor put it, ""It doesn't get worse than that."" That prosecutor, Joseph diGenova,
believes Trump was correct when he claimed Obama aides wiretapped his phones at Trump Tower.
These and other elements combine to make a toxic brew that smells to high heaven, but most Americans don't
know much about it. Mainstream media coverage has been sparse and dismissive and there's a blackout from the
same Democrats obsessed with Russia, Russia, Russia.
Partisan motives aside, it's as if a scandal of this magnitude is more than America can bear - so let's pretend
there's nothing to see and move along.
But, thankfully the disgraceful episode won't be washed away, thanks to a handful of congressional Republicans,
led by California Rep. Devin Nunes, chairman of the House's Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. After he
accused the FBI of stonewalling in turning over records, the bureau relented, at least partially.
The result was clear evidence of bias against Trump by officials charged with investigating him and Clinton. Those
same agents appear to have acted on that bias to tilt the election to Clinton.
In one text message, an agent suggests that Attorney General Loretta Lynch knew while the investigation was still
going on that the FBI would not recommend charges against Clinton.
How could she know unless the fix was in?
All roads in the explosive developments lead to James Comey (below left), whose Boy Scout image belied a
sinister belief that he, like his infamous predecessor J. Edgar Hoover, was above the law.
It is why I named him J. Edgar Comey last year and wrote that he was ""adept at using innuendo and leaks"" to let
everybody in Washington know they could be the next to be investigated.
It was in the office of Comey's top deputy, Andrew McCabe, where agents discussed an ""insurance policy"" in the
event that Trump won. Reports indicated that the Russia- collusion probe was that insurance policy.
The text was from Peter Strzok (below right), the top investigator on the Trump case, and was sent to Lisa Page, an
FBI lawyer and also his mistress. ""I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy's office - that there's no way he gets elected -
but I'm afraid we can't take that risk. It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40 . . . ""
Strzok wrote.
It is frightening that Strzok, who called Trump ""an idiot,"" was the lead investigator on both the Clinton and Trump
cases.
After these messages surfaced, special counsel Robert Mueller (below center) removed Strzok and Page from his
probe, though both still work at the FBI.
Strzok, despite his talk of an ""insurance policy"" in 2016, wrote in May of 2017 that he was skeptical Mueller's probe
would find anything on Trump because ""there's no big there there.""
Talk about irony. While Dems and the left-wing media already found Trump guilty of collusion before Mueller was
appointed, the real scandal might be the conduct of the probers themselves.
Suspicions are hardly allayed by the fact that the FBI says it can't find five months of messages between Strzok
and Page, who exchanged an estimated 50,000 messages overall. The missing period - Dec. 14, 2016 through May
17, 2017 - was a crucial time in Washington.
There were numerous leaks of classified material just before and after Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20th.
And the president fired Comey last May 9, provoking an intense lobbying effort for a special counsel, which led to
Mueller's appointment on May 19.
Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, has emerged from his hidey hole to notice that the FBI has run amok, and said
Monday he would ""leave no stone unturned"" to find the five months of missing texts.
Fine, but the House is racing ahead of him. Nunes has prepared a four-page memo, based on classified material
that purportedly lays out what the FBI and others did to corrupt the election.
A movement to release the memo is gaining steam, but Congress says it might take weeks. Why wait? Americans
can handle the truth, no matter how big it is."

Bank of America,Sting to headline NFL party?," Jan 19, 2018",0,"STING is in talks to headline an NFL Super Bowl pre-game ""tailgate"" concert as the latest mega pop star to appear
in Minneapolis for the big game, Page Six has exclusively learned.
During his set, the former Police rocker will perform one number with his recent reggae collaborator Shaggy at the
pre-Super Bowl gig on Feb. 4. Other acts are also in talks for the yet-to-be-announced pre-game show. A source
close to the league told us that the concert would be at a different site than the US Bank Stadium, where the game
will be played.
Justin Timberlake's playing halftime, with Pink singing the national anthem and Leslie Odom Jr. crooning ""America

The move to book Sting for the tailgate gig comes as the league further tries to capitalize this year on a new Super

Dave Matthews will perform a ""Night Before"" concert at Xcel Energy Center, backed by CBS Radio and On Location

boost ratings as a lead-in. For the past four years, halftime performances have drawn more viewers than actual
playing time.
Page Six previously reported that Sting and Shaggy are working on an album together, and the duo recently played
their song, ""Don't Make Me Wait,"" at a Shaggy &Friends benefit in Jamaica. Reps did not comment."
Bank of America,Abbas' Jew hatred exposed," Jan 17, 2018",1,"Now in the 14th year of a four-year term, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has been something of a riddle.
His modest, gentlemanly demeanor was a welcome contrast to that of his thuggish predecessor, Yasser Arafat.
Yet the difference in style never led to any diplomatic breakthroughs with Israel. Indeed, there has been scant
progress, despite promising moments and widespread international support for the creation of a Palestinian state.
And now we know why. Underneath it all, Abbas (pictured) is a two-faced, feckless leader who harbors a classic,
anti-Semitic view of Jews and world history.
The 82-year-old exposed himself in a nutty, blame-everybody speech Sunday in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
His intent was to bury President Trump for declaring that America recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's capital and
plans to move our embassy there, but instead, Abbas made the president look wiser than Solomon.
Trump's action, which broke with past presidents who gave Palestinians a heckler's veto over our policies, ripped
the mask off of Abbas' seeming moderation to reveal the same old Jew hatred that has been the cause of war after
war between Israel and its neighbors.
Equally important, the speech, which rambled on for 2/[2] hours, confirmed what Israel has been saying for years:
Abbas never would have made a lasting peace with the Jewish state.
And without that peace, a Palestinian state will remain a pipe dream.
As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu put it, Abbas' incendiary performance made it clear ""that the roots of the
conflict are opposition to a Jewish state within any borders. Not only the way he spoke, but the things he said help
us show the truth.""
Abbas' outlandish claims included a demand that Britain apologize for the 1917 Balfour Declaration, which
endorsed the idea of a Jewish homeland, and his charge that Israel drugs Palestinian children.
Incredibly, he even insisted that European Jews chose to remain there during the Holocaust.
""The Jews did not want to emigrate even with murder and slaughter. Even during the Holocaust, they did not
emigrate. By 1948, Jews in Palestine were no more than 640,000, most of them from Europe,"" he said.
He neglected to mention the reason why: During the war years, British authorities blocked most Jews from going
to Palestine following demands from Arab leaders.
After the war, Abbas continued, Europeans wanted to get rid of their surviving Jews, so deported them to Palestine.
""They wanted to bring Jews here from Europe to maintain European interests in the region,"" he claimed, adding
that ""Israel is a colonialist project that has nothing to do with Jews.""
Those conspiracy theories echo Abbas' long-ago Ph.D. thesis from a Russian university that the Holocaust was
overstated and that Jews had no historic claims to Palestine. Apparently, facts and time haven't educated him.
His speech, to a Palestinian legislative body, was ""professional suicide,"" an American official told me. ""It was a
meltdown where he showed his true colors and his intense hatred for the United States, Israel and the Jewish people. I don't know how he ever walks it back.""
The vitriol was extraordinary, even by Mideast standards. Abbas leveled a personal curse on Trump's house,
meaning his descendants, and spewed invective at fellow Arabs, especially Saudi Arabia, telling them to ""go to hell""
for criticizing him.
One possible explanation is that, after Trump's declaration about Jerusalem, Abbas felt trapped. He is not popular
at home, and even his efforts to spark demonstrations over Jerusalem fell flat.
It's also likely that Abbas was rebuffed by other countries that were critical of Trump's move, including some in
Europe and the Mideast. They probably told Abbas that he had no alternative except to deal with the United States
if he had any hopes of brokering a deal with Israel so that part of Jerusalem could also be a Palestinian capital.
Instead of following that conciliatory path, which might have yielded real progress, Abbas lashed out, declaring the
end of negotiations, promised to keep paying terrorists' families and talked of canceling existing agreements with
Israel.
His condemnations, which included attacks on America's UN ambassador, Nikki Haley, and David Friedman, the
American ambassador to Israel, almost guarantee that Trump will follow through with plans to slash American aid
to the UN agency that ministers to Palestinians, perhaps by half.
And Abbas likely sidelined himself from any dealings with the Trump administration, which has promised to
propose a settlement plan. But with no obvious replacement and no timetable for elections, the upshot is that
Abbas' blaze-of-glory act will do nothing for Palestinians except further delay their hopes of getting a state.
This sorry moment is no victory for anyone - except the truth. Rarely has there been such clarity that Israel has no
partner for peace.
As such, the possibility of more terrorist violence cannot be minimized. Just Tuesday, Israeli authorities removed a
cellphone bomb from Joseph's Tomb in Nablus in the West Bank.
It was detonated by security forces not long before 1,000 Jewish worshippers were scheduled to come to the spot
considered to be the burial site of the biblical patriarch.
Oddly, Abbas condemned the attempted slaughter. But after his fiery remarks, what did he expect?"
Bank of America,Banks striking gold on Trump reg. rollbacks," Jan 16, 2018",1,"It's three weeks after Christmas, but banks are still unwrapping presents.
In addition to President Trump's tax overhaul - a move that can add billions of dollars to the bottom line of the
country's major banks - rollbacks on regulations could add even billions more in profits, thanks to fewer fines and
less money spent on meeting regulations.
The improved prospects for the banks will come to light this week as Wall Street's financial giants report 2017 results - and give outlooks for 2018.
Many fattened bottom lines will come on top of already-record profits.
Not that brighter futures for the banks were a secret to investors. The Trump administration has made no secret of
its aim to cut regulatory red tape, tax and civil enforcement.
Shares of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley popped close to or more than 30
percent over the past year - easily outdistancing the S&P 500.
The gifts bestowed upon the banks by ""Santa"" Trump include:
n Easing up on enforcement by installing bank-friendly regulators, like Mick Mulvaney, the new interim head of the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau;
n Repealing rules that make it easier to bring class-action suits - hence pushing customers into arbitration, a bankfriendlier
environment.
n Granting additional waivers to banks over fines;
n Cutting the income tax to 21 percent.
""Enforcement is always the key,"" Anat Admati, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business - and
author of ""The Bankers' New Clothes: What's Wrong With Banking And What to Do About It"" - told The Post. ""Rules
mean nothing if you don't enforce them.""
Banks may even get a break from the Federal Reserve.
""Changing the tenor of supervision will probably actually be the biggest part of what it is that I do,"" Randal Quarles,
the Fed's top regulator, told bankers during his first public remarks on the job.
Late last month, the Trump administration granted three-year and five-year waivers to five banks - including
Deutsche Bank, to which Trump owes about $130 million, even after it was found to have manipulated interest
rates.
While the Obama administration had also granted one-year waivers to do business, the waivers offered by Trump's
regulators are three times and five times as long.
The Securities and Exchange Commission last year brought 17 percent fewer enforcement actions than in 2016 -
the lowest level since 2013, according to a study by Georgetown University.
The amount of SEC fines also fell 15.5 percent, the study showed.
Some observers on Wall Street see it differently, however.
Bankers have long grumbled that the Obama administration used Wall Street as a piggy bank, levying fines for
small infractions and scapegoating the industry over the financial crisis.
The Trump administration's move to shield banks from getting punished by wronged customers - by shelving the
rules in 2017 that gave a smoother path to class-action lawsuits - was called a ""hard-fought victory for the banking
industry"" by its lobbying group, the American Bankers Association.
Already, investors are beginning to understand just how much the tax overhaul will mean to banks.
JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, earned $4.23 billion last year. Dimon said on Friday the tax law
change would add $3.6 billion to its bottom line in 2018.
Less known is what effect the tax overhaul and the added profits it will bring banks - plus the rate increases by the
Fed - will have on bank customers.
No bank yet has said when - or if - it plans to raise interest rates paid to savings account holders."

Conservative: Wonks Made Celeb Presidents Possible
Michael Brendan Daugherty at National Review laments that ""the average voter is going to be blamed"" for the

hypnotized by their televisions."" But Daugherty blames policy wonks - ""who, unawares, made the celebrity
president not just desirable but logically necessary."" Wonks, he contends, are ""well-fitted to the centrist political
ideal"" of a government ""denuded of questions of value or morality"" and ""reduced to a purely technical exercise."" In
Europe, for example, ""policy questions are routinely taken away from the passions of democratic peoples, and
quarantined for expert management."" Thus celebrities can ""do the job of winning elections and riling up the public,""

Foreign desk: On Iran, Trump Should Be Like Reagan
This week, President Trump must once again decide whether to keep or kill the Iran nuclear deal. Richard Goldberg
and Dennis Ross at Politico say there's a middle choice - and it echoes the path of President Ronald Reagan, who
""successfully negotiated a major arms-control agreement with the Soviet Union,"" even while ""publicly calling it an
'evil empire,' building up America's strategic deterrence, promoting regime change and applying economic pressure
tied to the Soviet record on human rights."" Under the deal, the US and Europe would be within their rights to
""impose sanctions tied to human rights, terror and missiles."" Sanctions relief, they contend, ""should not be
interpreted as blanket immunity for Iranian officials, banks and other government instrumentalities to expand their
illicit activities.""
Critic: Restoring Earmarks Means Refilling the Swamp
President Trump may have campaigned on promising to drain the swamp in Washington, but now he's signaled his
support for restoring congressional earmarks. That may ""make the legislative process a bit more efficient,"" agrees
Phillip Wegmann at the Washington Examiner, but earmarks ""also lead to waste"" - as Trump himself has admitted.
Fact is, ""when negotiations break down, obstructionists sell their votes for things like a $233-million bridge nobody
needs."" And today's Republicans, most of whom were elected after 2010, ""have no personal knowledge or
experience with earmarks."" More significantly, these ""post-pork members didn't witness the conservative crusade
to end the practice."" So much for the ""political revolution launched against the swamp"" from across the political
spectrum ""all the way from Bernie to Trump voters.""
Policy expert: One TV Network's Key to Success America's political divide expresses itself in TV preferences, says Steven Malanga at the LA Times. Regions that

been ""a big winner"" for the Hallmark Channel and its affiliates: ""Amid declining viewership and revenue at many TV
networks, the Hallmark channels are on a roll."" They've done so by using the formula ""that once defined

Bank of America,A learning curve First-round Rangers pick Chytil gains seasoning in AHL ... pining for return to bigs," Jan 11, 2018",0,"BRIDGEPORT, Conn. - The 2017-18 hockey season is all about learning for Rangers first-round pick Filip Chytil:
adjusting to the speed and physicality of the game in a new country and playing with brand new teammates.
And then there are the off-ice lessons, which the 18-year-old center, who was drafted 21st overall in June, is taking
in stride.
""You're now paying your own bills, you're responsible for your own laundry, you're responsible for your groceries -
all life skills that you have to learn as a young player,"" AHL Hartford coach Keith McCambridge said.
After making the Rangers' opening-day roster out of camp and playing the first two games of his pro career in the
NHL, the organization had a decision to make: send Chytil to the Wolf Pack in Hartford, Conn., or back to his native
Czech Republic to play for HC Zlin. They chose the AHL. While he certainly misses home, Chytil is grateful for the
chance to stay stateside.
""We decided I'll stay here and I think it's better for my development. I think it can help me be in the NHL,"" Chytil,
who had five goals and seven assists in 15 games entering Wednesday, told The Post. ""I'm glad I'm here because
it's great for young players. I'm looking forward to the second half of the season.""
That unofficially began Wednesday when Chytil returned to play for Hartford in a 2-1 shootout win over Bridgeport
at Webster Bank Arena. It was his first game back since playing for the Czech Republic at the World Junior
Championship tournament.
McCambridge said he liked the way Chytil played in the tournament and also his attitude in the days surrounding it.
""We found right before he went over to the world juniors, there was a little bit of excitement in him and since he's
come back here, [from] the chance to spend time with his countrymen,"" McCambridge said. ""He always has a smile
on his face, but even more so.""
Chytil also got to spend some time with the Rangers' other 2017 first-round pick, Lias Andersson, the No. 7
selection, who captained the Swedish team.
Now back to life in the AHL where Chytil is getting used to the different style of play.
""The biggest thing that jumps out with Fil is the skill set, the ability to make plays in traffic, the vision when he has
the puck, seeing the ice, in the offensive zone the anticipation of where the next play is going to be made,""
McCambridge said. ""Part of him learning this North American game is making sure that - tendencies when guys
come over from Europe is they're going away from the puck instead of coming towards the puck, because
obviously you have more room to wind up with regards to your speed with the ice-surface difference.""
Chytil has battled through some minor injuries this season, but was back in the starting lineup playing alongside
Ryan Gropp and Scott Kosmachuk.
""Sometimes you catch yourself and you have to take a step back and look to see that he is only 18,"" McCambridge
said. ""But we like the growth that he's made and we're real happy he's made the decision to play over here in North
America with us.""
Just months after Chytil was drafted, he got the chance to live out his childhood dream of playing in the NHL. But
after getting a quick taste, he wants to punch his return ticket to Broadway.
""I want to be back,"" Chytil said. ""It's the best league in the world. I played against players like [Nathan] MacKinnon
or Auston Matthews and I watched them last year on the TV. [This year] I played against them. I want to be like
them and I'm doing everything to be a better player and be there as soon as possible."""
Bank of America,Don: Hold liars 'libel'," Jan 11, 2018",1,"President Trump on Wednesday revived a campaign promise to toughen America's libel laws to make it easier for
people to sue authors and media outlets.
""We are going to take a strong look at our country's libel laws so that when somebody says something that is false
and defamatory about someone, that person will have meaningful recourse in our courts,"" Trump said from the
White House.
The president, who routinely rails against ""fake news"" and has called the federal investigation into Russian
meddling in the 2016 presidential election ""a hoax,"" lambasted people who libel, saying, ""The person that has been
abused, defamed, libeled, will have meaningful recourse.
""Our current libel laws are a sham and a disgrace and do not represent American values or American fairness. We
want fairness. You can't say things that are false, knowingly false, and be able to smile as money pours into your
bank account,"" he continued.
Trump's comments follow the publication of Michael Wolff's book on the early months of the president's
administration, ""Fire and Fury,"" which paints a portrait of the commander in chief as an impulsive manchild
incapable of running the country.
Fact checkers have called Trump's own truthfulness into question, saying he often makes false or misleading
claims.
And at an afternoon news conference with Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg, Trump doubled down on his
claims about special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.
""There has been no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians or Trump and Russians. No collusion.
The Democrats are all running for office and trying to say this, but bottom line, they say there is no collusion. And
there is no collusion,"" Trump said.
Asked if would meet with Mueller, Trump was noncommittal, saying only, ""I'll speak to attorneys.""

Bank of America,NYers' Message for Blas: Kindly Curb Your Ego," Dec 30, 2017",1,"Mayor de Blasio's comments comparing himself to Mahatma Gandhi, Henry Ford and others.
If Hillary Clinton had accepted Mayor de Blasio's counsel, she would have lost the popular vote along with the
electoral college (""Delusions of Gandhi,"" Dec. 27).
Why should anyone want to follow a politician who is fighting income inequality from the perch of a taxpayerfunded
mansion and a six-figure salary?
The radical chic of establishing commissions to remove statues, oversee failing public monopolies (the city's
Department of Education) and micromanage the NYPD has failed to inspire anyone beyond the tiny Blas clique.
Gene Roman

How could the voters of New York City have been taken in by a fraud like de Blasio? His assertion that he will be
the leader of the progressive left and his placement of himself among the likes of Henry Ford, Thomas Edison and
Gandhi reveal his ego and delusions of grandeur.
The mayor is nothing but a scam artist, looking to make as much money as he can for himself and his cohorts.
They are turning the students of New York City into idiots. They keep lowering standards instead of improving the
teachers.
They get a lot of help from their bought-and-paid-for unions. As long as the unions keep paying, de Blasio &Co. will
do their bidding.
Andrew Rizzo Jackson, NJ
The mayor needs to know that there are drugs for delusional disorders. People often have grandiose fantasies and
believe themselves to possess talents beyond their intrinsic abilities, but they are treatable.
His view of himself as a progressive savior is in sharp contrast to reality. He was reelected by just 14 percent of
registered voters; not a very compelling endorsement.
His off-putting personality, thin skin and lack of problem-solving skills make him the least attractive person for the
national political stage.

Proverbs 27:2 says, ""Let someone else praise you, not your own mouth; a stranger, not your own lips."" In the end,
de Blasio is a civil servant. Civil servants are not entitled to be praised for doing their jobs. They can, however, feel
good about a job well done. That's about it. Civil servants are in office for the good of their citizens.
Bottom line, Bill: Historians will sort out how good of a job you did. You'll find out once you go back to the real

I don't see anything wrong with de Blasio comparing himself to Gandhi or anyone else.
I can compare myself to Mickey Mantle and Jesse Owens, but it doesn't mean I can run like Owens or hit like

Bank of America,BofA cements deal for HBO's digs," Dec 26, 2017",1,"Santa Claus came early for the new owners of 1100 Sixth Ave., the HBO building on Sixth and 42nd Street.
Bank of America and Brookfield Property Partners signed a lease on the eve of the Christmas weekend for the
building's entire 386,000 square feet, sources revealed.
The Post first reported that a deal was in the works on Nov. 21. BofA will move into 1100 Sixth Ave. when HBO
moves to 30 Hudson Yards in 2019, along with parent Time Warner.
BofA, led by Chief Executive Brian Moynihan, plans to keep its Manhattan headquarters at the Durst Organization's
One Bryant Park across the street.
However, the bank also has offices at widely scattered buildings around town, including in Rockefeller Center and
the GM Building at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street. The new space at 1100 Sixth Ave. will allow for staff
consolidation while creating a ""campus"" with the mother ship at One Bryant Park on the other side of the avenue.
The deal is the latest reflection of Midtown Sixth Avenue's office-leasing strength at the same time as the corridor
is enjoying a boom in retail leasing and hotel development.
Brookfield and California's Swig Co. (not to be confused with New York's Swig Equities) bought a long-term
leasehold on 1100 Sixth eight months ago from William H. Nickerson's Eugene A. Hoffman Management.
Nickerson developed the building in 1980.
Brookfield will soon announce a redesign of 1100 Sixth, which stands next door to the company's giant Grace

Bank of America,Shalom-coming Sprung kosher fraud back in B'klyn," Dec 22, 2017",0,"Thousands of people broke out the vodka and gave a hero's welcome to a convicted fraudster who returned to
Brooklyn after being freed by President Trump.
Sholom Rubashkin, 57, was sentenced to 27 years in prison in 2009 on multiple felony convictions for defrauding a
bank that lent his Iowa-based kosher meatpacking plant millions of dollars.
Rubashkin had served eight years when Trump commuted his sentence, earning plaudits from both the felon and
the Orthodox Jewish community.
""God should bless him [Trump] and the United States of America,"" Rubashkin told the Vos Iz Neias Web site
outside his home in Monsey, NY, where he was greeted by throngs of people Wednesday night.
He later traveled to Brooklyn to visit the Crown Heights headquarters of Chabad Lubavitch, which was instrumental
in lobbying for his release. There, scores of celebrants sipped on Smirnoff vodka to toast the newly freed man.
One attendee likened the celebrations to a 1987 outpouring after a Brooklyn judge ruled that the grandson of a
former Chabad leader could not sell the group's religious texts as his inheritance.
""Last night, it was a big celebration, like when 35 years ago the rabbi's books were released,"" Rabbi Mikhael Cohen,
56, told The Post Thursday. ""We have a great president. We should vote for Donald Trump next time. He does
things right. We finally have a president that does not follow the bubble of the politically correct concept.""
After the Chabad event, Rubashkin visited his parents' Borough Park home, according to Yeshiva World, which
posted video showing a sea of people singing and dancing in the streets and inside homes as they welcomed the
felon.
The reunion with his parents was an emotional scene as onlookers let out joyous shouts and broke into impromptu
songs, according to Vos Iz Neias.
Rubashkin lied about collateral when he took out a $35 million loan for his Agriprocessors meat-packing operation
in Postville, Iowa, causing the bank to lose $26 million when he declared bankruptcy after federal investigators
raided the plant and found more than 300 suspected undocumented immigrants working there, according to The
New York Times.
While Rubashkin's sentence was commuted, his conviction on 86 felony fraud counts was left intact.

Bank of America,Bonus cash paid Tax bill link is cited," Dec 21, 2017",0,"Call them Trump dollars.
Thousands of employees at some of the country's largest companies got an instant benefit from the tax-reform bill
passed Wednesday - in the form of raises and bonuses of $1,000 and more.
AT&T, Comcast, Wells Fargo, and Fifth Third Bank each handed out the presents, saying they reflected the
companies' expected windfall from lower corporate taxes.
The tax-reform bill cuts corporate taxes to 21 percent from 35 percent.
""Congress, working closely with the president, took a monumental step to bring taxes paid by US businesses in line
with the rest of the industrialized world,"" AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson, a major Republican donor, said
in a statement.
AT&T, which had an effective tax rate of 32.7 percent in 2016, will give 200,000 of its unionized workers a $1,000
bonus by the end of the year.
The bonus comes after a long fight over compensation with the Communications Workers of America, which
represents AT&T workers.
Comcast also will give $1,000 bonuses to 100,000 of its workers, according to an announcement.
Both AT&T and Comcast scored a win this month with the repeal of net neutrality. Both companies have matters
pending with Trump's Department of Justice. AT&T is fighting the antitrust agency's move to block its $85 billion
purchase of Time Warner.
President Trump cited AT&T's action on Friday, saying the company's payouts are ""pretty good.""
The Justice Department's consent decree on Comcast's 2011 acquisition of NBCUniversal expires in 2018 and the
regulator could decide to revisit it.
Wells Fargo, the country's No. 3 mortgage lender, which could also find itself in Uncle Sam's crosshairs, said it will
raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour. The hike is the second pay raise this year for tellers, phone bankers, and
customer-service reps, after raising wages to $13.50 an hour for 25,000 employees earlier this year.
The announcement comes just 12 days after Trump, in a tweet, promised not to let the bank off the hook for its
recent scandals.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is currently reviewing a proposed settlement of tens of millions of
dollars against the bank.
Fifth Third bank also will pay a $1,000 bonus to its 13,500 employees, and plans to lift base wages to $15 an hour.

statement.
The significance of the raises was played down by Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who noted that more than $83.7

Bank of America,CAROLINA CREEP Panthers owner decides to sell team as allegations of misconduct emerge," Dec 18, 2017",1,"Less than 12 hours after a report was published containing specific, upsetting allegations against Jerry
Richardson, the Panthers owner announced he is putting the team up for sale.
Richardson, the principal owner of the Carolina team since its inception in 1995, said he will be putting the team on
the market as soon as this season concludes.
""I believe that it is time to turn the franchise over to new ownership. Therefore, I will put the team up for sale at the
conclusion of this NFL season,"" Richardson said in a release. ""We will not begin the sale process, nor will we
entertain any inquiries, until the very last game is played. I hope everyone in this organization, both on and off the field, will be firmly focused on just one mission: to play and win the Super Bowl.
""While I will no longer be the team owner, I will always be the Panthers Number One fan.""
Earlier Sunday, Sports Illustrated published a thorough report illuminating the allegations that Richardson is facing
as the NFL investigates him for misconduct. The 81-year-old was painted as a person who had used his status,
power and image of kindly older man to sexually harass, and used his money to silence the victims.
Richardson has reached at least four ""significant"" monetary settlements with former employees due to his
behavior, racially slurred a black Panthers scout and used his power and status to lord over a disturbing
environment, according to the report.
The Panthers on Friday said they had opened an investigation, hiring outside law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and
Sullivan LLP and saying the team takes the then-publicly unknown allegations seriously. On Sunday, the NFL
announced it was taking over the investigation of Richardson, who, according to SI, did everything from ogling
women on ""Jeans Day"" to inappropriately touching them under the guise of putting on their seat belts.
Friday was ""Jeans Day,"" and the billionaire would ask Panthers employees to turn around so he could see their
figures, each time offering up a compliment - '""I bet you had to lay down on your bed to fit into those jeans,"" was
one recycled phrase.
Employees mostly excused this as action by a man from another generation, a Southern man whom everyone
simply referred to as ""Mister"" around Carolina headquarters.
""No one ever said anything, at least not that I heard,"" one former Panthers employee told SI. ""He was the boss. It
was [viewed] more of a creepy-old-man thing than a threat.""
According to the report, Richardson would try to gain trust of women he employed before further harassing them.
He would send hand-written notes to women, sometimes containing cash with which he would say to buy dresses
or a massage. He would then cross a line, they said, when he studied their bodies.
He would pay for manicures when he did not approve of their nails, they said; multiple female employees told SI
that Richardson asked them if he personally could shave their legs.
In further allegations that echo the ones Harvey Weinstein is facing, former employees said he would request their
presence at a Bank of America Stadium suite. They would be guided to the suite by a Richardson assistant, who
would then leave. One female former Panthers worker said when she arrived, Richardson was barefoot and
requested a foot massage. Others had stories about Richardson giving back rubs that traveled too far down their
spine.
""The first time, you thought it was an important meeting with the owner,"" one former employee said. ""You [then]
realized it was never anything that couldn't be discussed over the phone."""

Bank of America,A 'holy' new Israel view," Dec 13, 2017",0,"Here's my favorite joke from a week in Israel. What's the difference between secular, liberal Jews and Donald
Trump?
Trump has Jewish grandchildren.
From a distance, the politics of Israel look even more hopelessly fractured than our own. With 14 parties, including
secular Jews, ultra-Orthodox and Arabs, vying for 120 seats in the Knesset, coalition governments are the norm
and minor parties with a handful of seats become kingmakers.
But seen up close, those differences largely fade on the issue of national security. Because their tiny nation faces
existential threats from Iran and its proxies on three borders, Israelis are united in their commitment to protecting
their country.
Patriotism is borne of necessity and forged with near-universal military service. Parents speak with more pride
than fear about their children getting ready to serve.
Self-defense is an Israeli founding virtue because Jews learned over thousands of years that ""history can turn on
you at any moment,"" as one academic put it.
A shared realization that there is no place to run to was evident everywhere we went. A mother on a kibbutz near
Gaza told of the dangers of life along the border, where Hamas rockets fall from the sky and terrorists try to tunnel
underneath the fence.
She evacuated during the 2014 war, but soon came back, children in tow. Why doesn't she leave for good?
""I was born on this kibbutz,"" she says. ""This is our land. It was always part of Israel.""
Another Israeli mother we met lives only a few miles from the Syria and Lebanon borders, putting her family on the
front lines. She, too, wouldn't leave, saying, ""this is home.""
A human-rights leader was methodical in his criticism of his government's treatment of Israeli Arabs, but
passionate in defense of the Jewish state's right to exist with secure borders.
""The idea that Zionism is racism is outrageous,"" he declared.
Each time we heard a version of the love of country, I wondered whether Americans can recover their common
ground. That's not to suggest we lack patriots; it's just that the left and right define patriotism as differently as
night and day.
Our national security has become almost as partisan as taxes and abortion.
I was with a group of educators traveling with Project Interchange, a program of the American Jewish Committee.
The aim was to show us Israel in all its complexity and progress, and to meet people from across the spectrum.
We were there when President Trump made the historic declaration recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and
his plan to move the embassy from Tel Aviv. He was condemned in Europe and throughout the Mideast, but ""Israel
loves Trump"" signs appeared in Jerusalem, with even left-wing dissent muted.
That's because of another aspect of Israeli unity - the belief that Jerusalem is the eternal capital, no matter what outsiders say.
""It's that way for every Israeli,"" said Avital Leibovich, formerly the chief spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces
and now head of the AJC there.
Although virtually every American presidential candidate for the last 30 years promised the move that Trump
made, many Israelis were OK with delaying it until there was peace with the Palestinians. But the eagerness for
Trump to deliver on his promise now reflects the fact that most Israelis have given up on a deal with the
Palestinians.
Believing Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza are neither willing nor capable of making a deal and sticking to it,
they've moved on to improving relations with Muslim nations like Saudi Arabia and forging ties with China and
India.
Those changes in Israeli society led a Palestinian leader from the West Bank to tell us he was neither shocked nor
dispirited by Trump's move.
""It's been clear to Palestinians since the Oslo Accords that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel,"" said Elias Zananiri.
He said he ""admired Trump's careful approach"" in making it clear that Jerusalem is holy to three religions and that
the announcement does not preclude East Jerusalem from becoming a Palestinian capital.
He is also optimistic that, in his next move, Trump will tilt toward the Palestinians and Israelis will have to go
along.
Zananiri was disappointed that Mahmoud Abbas, head of the Palestinian Authority, denounced Trump's move. ""It
was sad and full of anger,"" he said of Abbas' speech. ""But neither side can be victims of the past. History is fixed, it
can't be changed.""
Zananiri, a Christian and former journalist, also surprised some in our group by suggesting former President
Barack Obama made things worse in his bid to forge a peace deal. He said Obama ""went too far and too fast"" and
that his focus on stopping Israeli settlements before talks could start ""put Abbas in a squeeze.""
""Abbas couldn't become less Palestinian than Obama,"" and so negotiations were frozen, he said.
Naturally, sentiments such as Zananiri's are nowhere to be found in the lockstep praise of Obama and criticism of
Trump by most American media. The ""sky is falling"" chorus was so certain that widespread violence was inevitable
that correspondents donned their flak jackets and combat helmets, eager to have their bias confirmed that Trump
had provoked mayhem.

Bank of America,IT'S HANKY BANKY Suit alleges debauchery at West Coast firm," Dec 9, 2017",1,"Banc of California? More like Hotel California.
A top exec at the West Coast bank turned its headquarters into a den of iniquity, having sex with junior employees
in his office, corralling workers for outings to strip clubs and indulging in drugs on the premises, according to an
explosive lawsuit.
That's on top of allegations that the bank screwed employees out of their bonuses last year,and then improperly
shifted the funds to cook this year's books, according to the suit filed this week by Heather Endresen, a former
managing director at the bank.
In the 24-page complaint, Endresen alleges that Executive Vice President and Interim CFO Francisco Turner
transformed the bank's Irvine, Calif., offices into a sleazy playpen, coercing young female employees into having
sex while also encouraging the bank's workers to do drugs in the office.
As for the late-night sessions at strip clubs, they were fueled by funds taken from the company's coffers, according
to the suit filed in California state court.
When she complained, Endresen says Mike Urtel, the head of human resources, blew off her concerns, saying they
were ""akin to rumor or gossip,"" the suit says.
One lawyer at the publicly traded bank, which operates 34 branches and has a $1 billion market cap, likewise
yawned at the salacious shenanigans, court papers indicate.
""Shockingly,"" Counsel Manisha Merchant ""explained that the company does not have a policy prohibiting
employees from engaging in sexual activity in the workplace, or a policy against using corporate funds to pay for
strip clubs,"" according to the complaint.
The bad behavior went all the way to the top, according to the suit. When Endresen complained to CEO Doug
Bowers, the boss admitted the company had received a similar complaint about Turner from another employee and
that it had tapped an independent investigator.
Nevertheless, Bowers broke a spoken promise to extend Endresen's family health insurance for six months after
she left the bank, prompting a costly and stressful health crisis for her son, the suit says.
When Endresen searched for a new job, Bowers ""lied to Ms. Edresen's prospective employers about the quality of
her work and her loan success rates,"" according to the complaint.
""We believe the action has no merit,and we intend to defend against the claims vigorously,"" a Banc of California
spokesman told The Post.
""The record should be clear, however, that we treat all matters of compliance with the utmost seriousness and any
suggestion otherwise is categorically wrong. We encourage all employees to raise any area of concern and we
investigate all claims thoroughly.""
Endresen alleged the bank took $7.8 million in 2016 bonuses and moved them to the next quarter, improperly
putting that money under liabilities. Endresen alleged Turner threatened her ""professional reputation"" when she
raised the accounting irregularities.
Turner resigned from the bank in June, getting a $2.75 million payout and continued health-care coverage for 18
months, public filings show.
Forbes recognized Banc of California as one of the 100 Best Banks in America in 2017."
Bank of America,On the brink of intifada Trump's Jerusalem shift sparks fury," Dec 8, 2017",0,"Hundreds of Palestinian protesters, enraged by President Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of the
Jewish state, clashed with Israeli troops Thursday amid calls by Hamas for a new intifada.
At least 31 people were wounded by Israeli army gunfire when the Palestinian protests erupted in the West Bank,
Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, officials said.
One person was in critical condition after Palestinian medical officials said 11 protesters were hit by live bullets
and 20 others by rubber bullets, according to Reuters.
The Israeli military, which denied live fire was used, said troops used ""riot-dispersal gear.""
Some protesters chanted, ""Death to America!"" and ""Death to the fool Trump!""
Schools and stores were closed as Palestinians staged a strike to begin three ""days of rage"" a day after Trump's
announcement, during which he also said the US Embassy will be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in coming
years.
In the Gaza Strip, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh called on Palestinians to abandon peace efforts with Israel and to
launch a new intifada, or uprising, on Friday.
""The American decision is an aggression on our people and a war on our sanctuaries,"" Haniyeh told supporters.
""We want the uprising to last and continue to let Trump and the occupation regret this decision.""
In the West Bank, a throng set tires on fire and hurled stones at Israeli troops. Soldiers fired water cannons and
tear gas in Bethlehem to disperse a crowd in clashes that could mar the upcoming Christmas celebrations. And in
Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian government, six people were wounded in protests, according to the
Palestinian Red Crescent.
In Jerusalem, protesters gathered at the Damascus Gate in the Old City and chanted, ""Trump, you will see,
Palestine will be free,"" the Jerusalem Post reported.
Meanwhile, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned Trump's seismic policy shift, saying the US has
hurt its credibility.
""Fortunately, there was a positive response from all the countries in the world, from Europe and from Africa and
countries close to America that don't support the US,"" said Abbas, who met Thursday with Jordan's King Abdullah
II to rally international opposition.
Federica Mogherini, the foreign-policy chief of the European Union, said the announcement ""has the potential to
send us backwards to even darker times than the one we are already living in.""
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said it would put the region in a ""ring of fire,"" according to AFP, adding,
""What kind of approach is this? Political leaders do not stir things up, they seek to make peace.""

that country's latest attack on a Manhattan federal trial where high-level Turkish officials have been accused of
bribery and money-laundering. ""My country can never be condemned by virtual courts set up by FETO [Fethullahist Terrorist Organization]
scoundrels' fake representatives,"" Erdogan said Saturday, according to Turkey's Hurriyet Daily News.
FETO refers to Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania who has been blamed for last year's coup
attempt in Turkey.
Erdogan made the comments in response to the Manhattan testimony of Reza Zarrab, a gold trader who testified
that Erdogan played a role in a scheme to help Iran avoid US and UN sanctions.
Zarrab, 34, who has pleaded guilty for his own role, is the star witness in the Manhattan federal trial of Mehmet
Hakan Atilla, an executive of a Turkish-government owned bank, with whom Zarrab allegedly worked to help Iran
launder money.
On Monday, Atilla's lawyers submitted to the court a series of jailhouse recordings from Zarrab that they said

Bank of America,NO PLACE LIKE HOME A Filipino-American returns to his native Manila to uncover all the shiny new things in the Philippines' capital," Dec 5, 2017",0,"AS soon as I land in my birthplace of Manila, I'm struck anew by my countrymen's signature friendliness, from a
gauntlet of flight attendants, still cheerful after a 20-hour journey from New York, to gate agents and luggage
handlers who exclaim, ""Welcome home!"" Visiting other Southeast Asian cities like Hanoi, in Vietnam, filled with
historic architecture, can be like taking a trip into the past, but the capital of the Philippines is a metropolis
constantly looking to the future. I visit Manila every few years, ever since I moved to America two decades ago, and
I remain shocked by how much has changed each time I return.
The Philippines, which was dubbed the ""sick man of Asia"" during the '90s because of its sluggish economy and
political corruption, is undergoing a resurgence.
Thanks to a steady stream of foreign investment and an increase in infrastructure projects, the World Bank
recently reported that the Philippines is one of the best-performing economies in Asia. Manila has also seen a
cultural renaissance - trendy restaurants, galleries and nightspots have opened up that cater to a growing urban
middle class who crave western luxuries. But the country's large income inequality remains: brandnew
condominiums occupied by the wealthy stand alongside crammed shanties filled with squatters.
And despite president Rodrigo Duterte's controversial (and often violent) war on drugs, Manila has seen an overall
drop in crime. It's also an affordable mega-city compared to neighbors like Singapore and Hong Kong.
Thanks to a new four-lane highway, our car takes a faster route past Fort Bonifacio into a district southeast of the
city center. Fifteen years ago, this sparsely populated land contained former military bases and the international
school I attended. In the past 20 years, it's been transformed into the city's commercial district, rebranded Global
City.
We pull up to the tall Shangri-La, the Asian chain's third and newest outpost in Manila (from $190; ShangriLa.com).
Opened in March 2016, the glittering hotel embodies Manila's claim to modernity, featuring 576 rooms decked out
with glass cabinets and surround-sound audio systems.
To stave off jet lag, I head across the hall on the 50th floor to meet my grandfather at the hotel's membersonly
lounge.
I order champagne, and my grandfather, a retired electrician who's never stepped foot in this hotel before, asks for
a glass of Hennessy without ice. His daughter - my mother - was a dirt-poor single mom who left her family's
provincial home to create a new life for herself in Manila.
""Don't forget where you came from,"" he warns. We clink glasses.
Typically, we'd eat at a family-style Filipino restaurant and scarf down meat stews, fried pork and stirfried noodles.
But tonight, for dinner, my grandfather and I meet my mom at Raging Bull, the hotel's art deco-style steakhouse that's popular for business lunches and dinners.
It's just one sign of a larger shift. Over the past several years, Manila's food scene has transformed from mostly
mom-and-pop eateries into a wider selection of international and fusion spots that offer cool twists on Filipino
cuisine.
A few evenings later, we eat at nearby Hey Handsome, an industrial cafe dreamed up by culinary students and
frequented by hipster types. Tapas-sized dishes include pork belly with sambal matah, an Indonesian salsa
(Facebook.com/ HandsomeCome).
Back in Global City, a friend introduces me to two raven-haired models. They wind up serving as my tour guides to
the new Manila.
We head a few blocks north to the Palace Pool, a megaclub stacked with the city's rich and beautiful.
It's surrounded by a series of other bars where patrons shake hands like Americans and airkiss like Spaniards - two
cultures that previously ran the Philippines (ThePalaceManila.com).
For a taste of old Manila glamour, head to the Peninsula (from $140; Manila.Peninsula.com) in the heart of Makati,
where my mother and I stay during our last night in the city.
Rooms are furnished with a mashup of marble, Filipino art and bamboo weaving, while bellhops are clad in Chinese
collars.
During the People Power Revolution in 1986, my mother and activists protested outside. Now, we're sitting in the
hotel's bar amongst the city's fashionable set, sipping on martinis as cigarette smoke wafts around us.
But here, change manages to seep into even the most old-school establishments.
Next to us at the bar, a wellappointed couple is deep in conversation about politics. Word on the street is that an
executive order is being considered that would ban smoking in all public areas in the city, as well as implement a
tobacco tax. The woman pulls out a Marlboro, which the man lights with a Zippo.
""Is it really necessary?"" she says in Tagalog, the local dialect. ""We're trying to become too American."" Tellingly, six
months later, Duterte's smoking ban passes.

The further you go south on the I-95 corridor, the cheaper it gets.
South Carolina is the best, where you can get gas priced at less than $2 per gallon.
Prices did spike in the area of $2.70 after the storms, but have pretty quickly and efficiently come back down. I
really think it's just another NYC thing you all get with the package of irritants that comes with living in ""The City.""

I may just visit you folks down there and bring a big gas can.
Dear John: We need your help with something.
When my wife did her taxes in 2014 for the fiscal year of 2013, she made a contribution into her IRA account. And
she did the same in the year 2015 for the fiscal year 2014, and the same every year after.
My wife would go to the bank - Citi - and fill out the contribution form and the bank would fill the amount and mark
the year the contribution was to be made for.
This year she did her taxes for the fiscal year 2016 and when she went to the bank to make the IRA contribution,
she was told that she can't because the money is already there!
This happened because in 2015, Citi did not deposit any money into to the IRA for the fiscal year 2014, and made
the deposit toward the present year instead of for the prior year.
When my wife went to the bank to have this fixed, she was told that it can't do anything and to have the accountant
fix it. The accountant said it is the bank's responsibility.
Do you know if this will be a problem with the IRS? And is this the bank's responsibility? our help will be very much appreciated. K.S.
Dear K.S.: Citi says that ""customer satisfaction is (its) top priority,"" but I don't think you are going to be satisfied
with this answer.
""We have investigated this matter thoroughly. In this instance, a current-year contribution was made in 2015 and a
confirmation letter was mailed to the client.
""While contribution requests may be changed if done so promptly and within IRS deadlines, we are unable to
change the contribution request at this late date,"" Citi said.
You would have had until the 2014 personal income tax filing deadline (without extensions) to change the 2015
current-year contribution to a prior-year contribution.
You are probably going to want to fix this now by filing amended returns, or it'll come back to take a chunk out of
your backside at a later date.
In this case, I guess the customer isn't always right.

Rental car run-in cost 'deer'-ly
Dear John: My car rental nightmare is still going on from May. A deer ran across an interstate at dusk and hit my
car going typical speed. This was a Thrifty car rental. The damage was to the front fender.
I paid the $1,000 deductible on my USAA policy, but still ended up owing $950. Why? Because the fine print on the
rental contract says the car rental company can charge a ""diminution of value charge"" of $570 in this case, a lossof-
use fee of $210 and an administration fee of $150, which it did.
Guess what my insurance company's fine print says? It does not pay those fees. Nice to know after the fact. Damn
deer! R.R.
Dear R.R.: This is all good to know and that's why I'm printing this letter.
Give me your full name in case Thrifty asks, which it is likely to do. I always get a lot of letters when I write about
car rental companies, which probably means they aren't very nice to their customers.
But, all in all, I think the deer made out the worst in this.
HOW CAN I HELP?"
Bank of America,UN Blacklist Insanity EDITORIAL," Dec 3, 2017",1,"The UN Human Rights Council is well-known for its hostility toward Israel, but a project it's about to complete puts
it into truly bizzaro territory.
UN rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein (who last year compared then-candidate Donald Trump to ISIS) is set to
release a blacklist of companies that operate in Israel's West Bank settlements, as part of an HRC-ordered
""investigation"" of their impact on Palestinians.
That's right: The council believes companies doing business in the settlements somehow constitutes a humanrights
violation. Never mind that many of these firms provide jobs for Palestinians in the area and that the blacklist
could cost many of them meaningful work.
Or that the companies provide needed goods and services to anyone, no matter their background or where they
live.
Ignore, too, the fact that the panel, as the Israeli-based Kohelet Policy Forum notes, has never voiced any humanrights
concerns about firms in ""occupied territory"" settlements elsewhere in the world, even where ethnic cleansing
has taken place. And that numerous legal opinions and rulings OK such practices, with some citing language in the
Fourth Geneva Convention.
The World Bank itself has lent billions to companies in occupied territories around the world. Heck, even the United
Nations' own legal adviser, in a 2002 memo on Western Sahara, concluded that such a practice raised no humanrights
concerns.
But then, the move by the HRC isn't really about fighting human-rights abuses (or, for that matter, making rational
and consistent policy of any kind). It's about trying to hurt Israel in any way possible and gin up opposition toward
it.
Toward that end, the council has long served as an anti-Israel propaganda machine. Which is why America's UN
Ambassador Nikki Haley threatened a US pullout from the organization if it didn't end its obsession with unfairly
slamming Israel.
""When the council passes more than 70 resolutions against Israel, a country with a strong human-rights record,
and just seven resolutions against Iran, a country with an abysmal human-rights record, you know something is
seriously wrong,"" Haley pointed out last summer.
US and Israeli officials fear a UN blacklist could deter businesses that are based in their countries and hurt the
companies' shares. They're racing to contain the damage. Yet other nations with companies in the settlements
could also be hurt. Meanwhile, the council and Hussein's office get hundreds of million of dollars every year, much of it from the
United States. Surely there are better uses for that money."
Bank of America,Banks duck consumer protection turmoil," Nov 28, 2017",1,"While Washington was buzzing on Monday over the battle for immediate control of a key consumer financial
watchdog, New York's major banks were strangely quiet.
Representatives for several banks - as well as the American Bankers Association, an industry group - declined to
comment on the White House's effort to name Mick Mulvaney the acting director of the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau.
The CFPB, a favorite punching bag for Republicans since it was established in 2011, tried to block the White House
from naming an interim boss.
The bureau's deputy director, Leandra English, asked a Washington court to block the appointment of Mulvaney.
Mulvaney is expected to curb the agency and make its enforcement of banking regulations less aggressive. In the
past, Mulvaney has been critical of the CFPB.
But several banks, the ABA and the Independent Community Bankers of America were quiet when asked for their
take on the tug-of-war.
""I always say, put not thy faith in judges,"" Iain Murray, a vice president at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told
The Post, when asked about the hubbub over the Washington legal face-off.
Wall Street executives tend to shy away from publicly making recommendations about what their regulators
should do - fearing that those comments would drive a bureaucrat to impose bigger fines or go fishing for broken
rules. The banks, too, may have confidence in the White House's eventually placing a more bank-friendly permanent
director in place - and thus were hedging their short-term bets in case English prevailed in her court battle."
Bank of America,Taken for a ride One car renter's nightmare Dear John The Answer Man," Nov 26, 2017",1,"Dear John: Back in January 2016 I was in an automobile accident involving an Enterprise car I'd rented.
Essentially, a guy towing a utility truck or van - it's in the police report - stalled in the center lane of an expressway.
I realized this too late to brake properly and sideswiped the rear vehicle.
Although I ended up with just a few scrapes and bruises, I had to be cut out of the car by the local fire department
and transported to the hospital.
When I rented the car, I had not taken the collision damage waiver because I was using my American Express card,
which, as you know, offers that protection - so I figured I was OK. That was not the case. Amex paid $10,490.00 of
the $13,989.40 in damages and related costs.
The difference, as I understand it, is that Enterprise chose to total the car instead of repair it. And in addition, Amex
was disputing the cost of one of two tows that resulted after the accident. Representatives from Amex have told me more than once that they consider the case still unresolved and are
waiting for Enterprise to respond to their queries before deciding whether they will fork out any more money.
After months of radio silence - particularly on Enterprise's end - I recently received a notice from a collection
agency seeking to recover the difference, and I thought of you. Please a) suggest a resolution that won't bleed me
dry, and b) tell your car-renting readers how to avoid such a pitfall in the future.
F.D.
Dear F.D. As you know, I contacted both Enterprise and American Express, and the matter has been resolved - by
Amex.
F.D. picks up the story: ""I finally spoke to someone at American Express. She was very polite and apologized for
the delay, but explained that Enterprise was not very communicative.
""She explained that after finally bringing Enterprise to the table, the car rental company refused to budge or
compromise on the difference between Amex's assessment of the damages and Enterprise's decision to total the
car.""
But as a gesture of goodwill, Amex decided to cover the difference.
My advice: Before you rent a car, check what your insurance will cover. If it doesn't cover a total loss, then pay for
the extra insurance.
F.D. had something else to say about Enterprise: ""I was also surprised - and not pleasantly - at the rude way in
which I was treated by representatives of the company when I sought to resolve this. The home page of the
company's Web site reads, ""We care about what our customers think and how they feel.""
""I call that BS,"" says F.D. ""This would have dragged on had you not gotten involved. Thank you very much for giving
it your attention.""
Chasing away bank-fee confusion
Dear John:
I have a substantial savings/checking account at JPMorgan Chase. I am confused by the rule that more than six
transactions can be charged a fee, including savings moved into my checking account.
If you have $15,000 in the bank the fees would be waived.
However, if you do the withdrawals or transfers in the bank and use a teller or ATM, it does not count toward the
six.
Yet Chase employees claim that transfers/withdrawals done in that bank via ATM or a teller count towards the fee.
Why are banks allowed to gouge their customers like this?
S.B.
Dear S.B. You certainly have me confused. So I asked Chase, and here's the answer:
Chase caps the number of savings withdrawals or transfers at six per month, including those at the ATM, branch or
others. ""This is to discourage customers from using their savings account like a transaction account, helping them
build savings as intended,"" says a Chase spokesperson.
She said that in order to avoid withdrawal fees after the six transactions, Chase requires customers to maintain
larger balances at the bank. ""Or they can simply change to a checking account where there are no limits to
withdrawals,"" she said.
Dear John: The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates four times, and my savings account at Chase Bank gets
0.06 percent.
And I'm a ""Chase Private Client"" - meaning I get the highest rates. My rate hasn't moved in the last several years.
Why? Chase chief Jamie Dimon needs to increase the rates at his bank. When are the banks going to start giving us
more on our money? J.B.
Dear J.B. I couldn't have said it better.
But you get all these people who say that banks really want higher rates. That it helps them. Maybe in some ways.
But as long as they can keep your Private Client money in the bank without having to pay you anything, what's the
incentive to change things?
The day may come when banks need your deposits again - just maybe not in my lifetime.

Bank of America,TIGHT SPOT Gang's safeties must find way to contain TE Olsen," Nov 25, 2017",1,"The Panthers, whose offense accumulated a franchise record 548 net yards in their latest game, a 45-21 rout of the
Dolphins, are about to get one of their biggest playmakers back from injury.
Just in time to face the Jets at MetLife Stadium.
Tight end Greg Olsen - born in Paterson, N.J. - will return to his home state and the football field Sunday, giving an
already dangerous unit ""more ammo,"" as Jets coach Todd Bowles said.
The 32-year-old, three-time Pro Bowler broke his foot in Week 2 against the Bills and was on injured reserve until
the Panthers activated him Friday. Carolina coach Ron Rivera said the plan is to work him back into action
""judiciously.""
Nonetheless, Bowles is anticipating the same Olsen he has seen in the past: An ""all-around"" tight end who blocks
well, runs solid routes and has been a favorite target of quarterback Cam Newton.
""We expect to get the same All-Pro guy that's been playing,"" Bowles said. ""Obviously they wouldn't play him if he
was still hurt.
""When he's out there, he's productive.""
There's no questioning that.
In each of his previous three seasons, Olsen has notched 1,000 or more receiving yards, becoming the first tight
end in NFL history to achieve that feat.
Among tight ends, he currently ranks eighth all-time in receiving yards and sixth all-time in receptions.
The last time the Jets encountered Olsen - a 30-20 loss at Bank of America Stadium in 2013 - the 6-foot-5, 255-
pounder led the Panthers with five catches for 88 yards.
""It's a big challenge. He's a great tight end. Been around for a long time. Can run all the routes. Has great catch
radius,"" rookie safety Marcus Maye said. ""Now [their offense] can do a lot more with him on the field.""
Like what exactly?
""Two tight end sets [with Ed Dickson],"" Maye said. ""With [Olsen], they can spread him out wide. They do a lot with
him.""
Dickson, an eighth-year player out of Oregon, has shown flashes in Olsen's absence, recording 382 receiving yards.
He scored a touchdown in the Panthers' win against Miami. The game plan, according to Maye, hasn't really changed with the news of Olsen's return. The defense will use a
collective effort to try to contain him. No one player will draw Olsen as his sole or primary assignment.
That being said, the Jets' other rookie safety - 22-year-old Jamal Adams - has often found himself matched up
against opposing tight ends. And the results haven't always been encouraging.
The Jets have already seen high-caliber guys such as Cameron Brate and O.J. Howard, Rob Gronkowski, and Jared
Cook. According to Pro Football Focus, Adams has surrendered four touchdowns and allowed a passer rating of
123.6 when covering tight ends.
""Everybody gives up a couple catches here and there,"" Maye said, backing his teammate. ""For the most part, I feel
like he's been doing a great job covering those tight ends.""
""He's won some battles and he's lost a few. Obviously he can learn some things as he goes,"" Bowles echoed. ""He's
there - just got to find the ball some. At times, he's played great on them. He gave up two or three plays that he'd
like to have back. But overall, he's doing fine.""
It is no small task for anyone on the defense, let alone a rookie, to deal with a proven veteran like Olsen.
""We know that they are going to try to get him the ball, see where he's at,"" Maye said. ""He's definitely an impact
tight end, so we got to be prepared."""

Bank of America,"Post Focus on Commercial Real Estate Sixthsational Ave. deals BofA, Mizuho have designs on street"," Nov 21, 2017",0,"Bank of America is bullish on New York - and on Sixth Avenue.
Just eight months after Brookfield Properties and California's Swig Co. bought the leasehold on 1100 Sixth Ave.,
Bank of America, led by Chief Executive Brian Moynihan, plans to expand from its One Bryant Park headquarters
into the entire 386,000-square-footer across Sixth Avenue that's been home to premium cable channel HBO since 1981, The Post has learned.
Corporate and real estate sources confirmed the bank's hop across the avenue. HBO is to move along with parent
company Time Warner to Related Cos.' new 30 Hudson Yards in 2019. HBO's relocation isn't expected to be
affected by Time Warner's proposed $85 million sale to AT&T, which the Justice Department on Monday moved to
block.
Brookfield is expected to soon announce a top-to-bottom redesign of 1100 Sixth. The publicly traded giant knows
from redesign - its 5 Manhattan Yards, 450 W. 33rd St., is unrecognizable from its ugly concrete-faced old self after
a $350 million recladding in crystalline glass.
Brookfield and Swig - which is not New York's Swig Equities - bought a long-term leasehold on 1100 Sixth from
William H. Nickerson's Eugene A. Hoffman Management Inc.
HBO has been at the address since 1981.

As we first reported Monday at nypost.com, global management consulting giant McKinsey &Co. is moving its
headquarters from 55 E. 52nd St. to Three World Trade Center.
The deal - kept so under wraps that not even word of negotiations seeped out - is a Thanksgiving present for
developer Larry Silverstein. It's also a gift to the thriving downtown office scene, which boasts a healthy mix of
media, creative and traditional financial firms.
But it's another loss for East Midtown, where the effects of recent rezoning to allow large new modern buildings to
rise might not be felt for years.
Although fine points of the lease have yet to be worked out, McKinsey executives were told of the planned move in
a memo last week. Many employees were treated to a walk-through of their new home.
Sources said that McKinsey will take about 200,000 square feet on floors 60 to 64 of 80-story Three World Trade
Center, including a 5,000-square-foot, south-facing outdoor terrace on the 60th floor.
Once the 15-year lease is signed, as is expected, McKinsey will join GroupM at the Richard Rogers-designed tower.
The building is to open in May. The lease would raise office occupancy to 900,000 square feet in the 2.5-millionsquare-
foot tower.
Terms were not known, but office asking rents at 3WTC have been reported in the $80s per square foot.
McKinsey has some 14,000 ""consultants"" in 120 cities around the world. The Manhattan office, which it will leave
behind, is the firm's largest, with more than 900 executives.
Silverstein declined to comment, and reps for McKinsey couldn't immediately be reached.

In another mega-deal on Sixth Avenue, Mizuho Americas has signed for 270,000 more square feet at Rockefeller
Group's 1271 Sixth Ave., the former Time-Life Building, at West 50th Street.
That's on top of a 141,000- square-foot lease Mizuho signed there in June. The new deal brings the bank's total
commitment in the 2.1-million-square-foot tower to 411,000 square feet.
Mizuho will be the redeveloped tower's largest tenant, topping MLB, which originally signed for 400,000 square feet
but recently scaled back to 325,000 square feet, as The Real Deal reported.
Although the subsidiary of Japan's Mizuho Financial Group was expected to add more space at 1271 Sixth after it
signed the June lease, the size of the new deal came as a surprise. Earlier reports speculated Mizuho was looking
at not more than an additional 200,000 square feet.
The Rockefeller Group is in the midst of a $600 million redevelopment of 1271 Sixth designed by architecture firm
Pei Cobb Freed - including an entirely new curtain wall.
Mizuho was repped in negotiations by the Savills Studley team of Mitchell Steir, Matthew Barlow, Steve Berliner
and David Goldstein. Rockefeller was repped by a CBRE team led by Mary Ann Tighe, Howard Fiddle and John
Maher, along with a Rockefeller Group in-house team led by Ed Guiltinan."

Bank of America,Rich get richer Top 1% now hold over half the world's wealth," Nov 15, 2017",0,"The global wealth imbalance is growing, a shocking new report reveals.
The top 1 percent have amassed more than half of the world's wealth and control 50.1 percent of the planet's $280
trillion in assets as of mid-2017, the report found.
That's up from the 45.5 percent of the world's wealth in the hands of the top 1 percent in 2000, according to data
released Tuesday in Credit Suisse's Global Wealth Report.
The world's richest folks were able to increase their grip on the world's wealth because their assets increased in
value faster than those held by the lower 99 percent, the bank said.
Holdings of the top 5 percent and top 10 percent also ratcheted upward, and currently account for 76.4 percent
and 87.8 percent, respectively, of total global wealth.
Americans saw their wealth grow 10.1 percent in the past year, faster than in any other country, according to the
report.
In the US, there were 1.1 million new millionaires created in the past 12 months - or one new millionaire every 30
seconds.
The average American adult is worth $388,585 in 2017, according to the report, up from $211,000 in 2000.
The rise in wealth in the US means that more millionaires reside in the States - 15.4 million of us have a seven-digit
net worth, or 43 percent of all on the planet - than anywhere else in the world.
Japan has the second most millionaires, with 2.7 million. But its tough economy last year pushed 340,000
Japanese from millionaire status.
The survey, now in its eighth year, defines wealth as the value of financial assets plus real assets (principally
housing), minus household debts.
Once debt was subtracted, a person needed only $3,582 to rank among the wealthiest half of world citizens, Credit
Suisse calculated.
If you have a worth of $76,754 - that is assets minus debt - congratulations, you are among the world's top 10
percent wealthiest. A net worth of $770,368 would place you among the top 1 percent on the planet.
In the US, baby boomers - those aged 50 to 70 - continued to see their net worth grow the fastest.
Millennials, on the other hand, have had ""a run of bad luck,"" according to the report.
This group, defined as ""people who came of age after the turn of the century,"" not only sustained capital losses in
the global financial crisis but also carried the most student debt and faced stringent mortgage qualifications.
Throw in increased income inequality and lower income mobility and the result was ""a 'perfect storm' holding back
wealth accumulation by the millennials.""
The report also addressed the world's wealth disparities.
China accounts for 22 percent of the adult population, for example, yet only 10 percent of the world's wealth.
Latin America, with 9 percent of the population, has only 3 percent of the wealth.
Income disparity was even worse in India and Africa - areas where, Credit Suisse said, the share of population often
exceeded the share of wealth by a factor of 10 or more. Here are the eye-popping facts:
Percentage of total wealth held by global 1 percenters
2000: 45.5%
2017: 50.1%
n 2 new US millionaires are minted every minute
n Average adult net worth: $388,600 in 2017

Bank of America,"Rx for harassers Banker talks prevention, lauds revenge"," Oct 26, 2017",1,"Sallie Krawcheck has a few choice words when it comes to the subject of Harvey Weinstein.
""Don't molest your employees,"" the financial pro declared in a thinly veiled reference to the disgraced Hollywood
producer, when asked at a Wednesday panel what makes for good leadership. The former top banker at Citigroup and Bank of America, now chief executive of online investment adviser Ellevest,
went on to celebrate the fact that women increasingly are going online to call out sexual harassment.
""I think what's happening is amazing ... that women are using social media and the proliferation of media to speak
out against these predators.""
Krawcheck herself also also used the media - specifically, a Wednesday blog post on WealthManagement.com - to
detail harassment she experienced during her time as director of research at Sanford C. Bernstein.
A male colleague, whom she didn't name, invited Krawcheck to his hotel room ""while sticking out his tongue and
wiggling it"" at her, according to the post.
She refused and got her revenge years later when the man was up for a big job at Citi after Krawcheck moved
there. She said she informed the hiring manager of the man's behavior and threatened to quit - ""and not quietly"" - if
he was hired.
But for all the recent progress made in holding sexual predators accountable, Krawcheck stressed during the panel
that more needs to be done.
A ""bottle blond, Southern female financial services executive"" always looks like the best candidate, Krawcheck
joked before doubling down on the importance of diversity. ""I will make a controversial statement. Diversity beats
meritocracy,"" she said.
""What really sticks out for me is the confidence and ability to bring together a group who is diverse and different -
cognitive diversity so that you can see these problems in many, many different ways,"" Krawcheck said."

Bank of America,Penn fling in 'sexico' Chapo gal: I bedded actor," Oct 21, 2017",0,"Sean Penn's bungle in the jungle just got muy caliente!
The epic tale of Penn's awkward rendezvous with notorious drug kingpin Joaqun ""El Chapo"" Guzmn in 2015 has a
tawdry twist - the sexy Mexican actress who facilitated the meeting said Friday she had sex with the Oscar winner.
""I never fell for him. We had sex,"" former soap star Kate del Castillo told ""Good Morning America"" about her romp
with Penn. ""We're both adults, single and something was going on, but that was it. It was business.""
Del Castillo - initially rumored to have had a fling with El Chapo - revealed she instead bedded the ""Mystic River""
star during his misguided attempt to interview the infamous Sinaloa cartel leader.
""It was so stupid,"" del Castillo said about her rumored affair with the drug lord.
""They were all thinking I had something to do with El Chapo and nobody ask me [about Penn] - and I'm not bragging
about that.""
The actress went public with the dalliance after Penn attempted to stop Netflix from streaming her three-part
documentary about the meeting.
Del Castillo's doc, ""The Day I Met El Chapo: The Kate del Castillo Story,"" revolves around the secretive setup
between Penn and El Chapo - which led to a story by Penn in Rolling Stone magazine.
When asked why she waited so long to reveal the fling, the seductive actress said ""nobody asked me.""
The film depicts the pair wining and dining as the ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" actor seduces her.
""He said, 'That moment when you touched my chest, I knew something would happen between us,'"" del Castillo
recalls Penn telling her in the documentary, according to The Daily Mail.
The actress added that when they got back from the meeting, ""We were very moved so [it] made sense that
something would happen.""
Penn has been fighting the release of the documentary.
The actor is in a rage about allegations that he tipped off US authorities about El Chapo's whereabouts - and
believes that the release of the documentary may put him in harm's way.
Penn's lawyers have told Netflix execs that ""blood will be on their hands"" if they air the series. El Chapo was captured during a shootout three months after his meeting with Penn in the jungle.
""This is nothing but a cheap, National Enquirer-esque tale spun be a delusional person whose hunger for fame is
both tawdry and transparent,"" a spokesperson for Penn said about the film that premiered Friday.
""It is reprehensible that, in their ongoing, relentless efforts to gain additional attention and publicity, Ms. del
Castillo and her team who have zero firsthand knowledge have sought to create this profoundly false, foolish and
reckless narrative.""
Penn's account of that meeting was published in Rolling Stone one day after the drug lord's arrest."

sale of a uranium company to Russia's state-owned nuclear monopoly. While no one has yet convincingly linked
the two events, ""the story of toxic Russian money - government money handled by crooked officials and the profits
they make from it -is all about connecting the dots."" But unraveling this web is ""the only way to get at real, effective
Russian influence and at Western politicians entangled"" in it.
Conservative: Kaepernick Collusion Claim a Likely Loser
Former San Francisco QB Colin Kaepernick's claim that NFL owners ""schemed to blackball him"" from playing
because of President Trump's complaints over his national-anthem protests has a fatal flaw, says National
Review's Andrew McCarthy: ""If you're going to do Muhammad Ali-type activism, you'd better have Muhammad Alitype
talent."" Kaepernick, he notes, ""had been out of the league for months before the president recently began
inveighing"" against the take-a-knee protests. His problem is that he's currently ""a mediocre player"" who didn't live
up to his initial success, and ""mediocre players cannot afford to have his kind of baggage."" Fact is, ""Colin
Kaepernick is no longer on an NFL roster because he is a shell of the player he once was.""
Political scribe: Bannon's Bark Is Worse Than His Bite
Too many people in the Trump inner circle ""fancy themselves as mini-Machiavellis, and not enough people know
how to get things done,"" suggests Josh Kraushaar at National Journal. Which is why former Trump strategist
Steve Bannon's threat ""to go after sitting Republican senators with primary challenges is a textbook case of
someone who holds a grand vision of politics but hasn't demonstrated the ability to put tactical bite behind his
bark."" True, he ""understands the grand contours of Republican politics these days better than many GOP insiders.""
But ""Bannon has never shown any expertise in the nitty-gritty work of winning congressional campaigns."" And he
may soon find that ""beating Hillary Clinton may look like child's play compared to toppling entrenched Republican
senators with ample resources behind them."" From the right: The GOP's Bump-Stock Cop-Out
Congressional Republicans are now backing away from legislation banning ""bump stocks,"" which effectively turn
semiautomatic rifles into machine guns, reports Marc Thiessen at The Washington Post. They'd prefer the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to instead do it by executive action. But Thiessen warns that
""empowering ATF to ban firearms devices without explicit authorization from Congress is a far greater threat to the
Second Amendment than any legislation Congress could pass."" Imagine, he says, ""what Hillary Clinton would have
done with that power as president."" Indeed, it ""could set a precedent"" for future Democratic presidents. But
congressional Republicans are ""trying to avoid accountability."" Such gimmicks, he argues, ""are cowardly and an
insult to the American people."" Better to pass ""limited, carefully crafted legislation."""

Bank of America,Swank banks shrank Q3 trading flops," Oct 13, 2017",1,"Wall Street took its lumps on Thursday after two large banks reported weak third-quarter trading.
The results from JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup spooked investors and siphoned off value from each of the large
banks.
JPMorgan, the largest US bank, saw a huge 27 percent drop in bond trading revenue, to $3.1 billion, compared with
the same period last year. That's worse than a slump of about 20 percent that Dimon had signaled at a conference a month ago.
Overall, the bank's profits rose 7 percent on higher lending, to $6.7 billion.
Citi, which has been the best-performing major bank this year, reported a more modest 11 percent decline in
trading, to $3.6 billion, with bond trading off 16 percent.
Last month, Citi financial chief John Gerspach had warned of a 15 percent trading decline.
The bank, led by CEO Michael Corbat, made up for the trading drop with a 14 percent increase in investment
banking revenue, to $1.2 billion.
Wall Street's CEOs had previously warned analysts that trading was going to be down for the three months ending
in September, as calm markets and stable interest rates quash any reasons to buy or sell.
The meh results sent JPM shares down 85 cents, to $95.99, and Citi's shares down 3.4 percent, to $72.37.
Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America each were down slightly.
Even with the tepid results, JPMorgan reported record revenue in commercial banking and in assets in its wealth
management business - signs, the bank says, of a strengthening economy.
The earnings came a day after NBC published an op-ed by Dimon calling for lowering taxes on businesses, arguing
that it would ultimately lead to more jobs and higher wages for workers.
When pressed during a morning call, Dimon declined to pledge to raise wages for his own workers if the Trump
administration cuts taxes for businesses like JPMorgan.
""Well, that's not the way to look at it,"" he said, noting that they had raised wages for lower-paid workers previously.
JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti said that the company already pays its workers competitively.
""Over time, yeah, we probably would be boosting jobs and wages more than we otherwise would have,"" Dimon
added later."
Bank of America,Grant's tome Our 18th president gets the big bio treatment - and the revelations will surprise you," Oct 8, 2017",1,"Ron
Chernow has a thing for misunderstood men.
He painted a compelling portrait of a financial juggernaut in ""Titan,"" his 1998 biography of John D. Rockefeller Sr.,
and won a Pulitzer for his 2010 ""Washington: A Life,"" a psychologically revealing account of America's first
president. Oh, and who could forget ""Alexander Hamilton,"" which brought the boy genius Founding Father to the
masses, spawning a Tony-winning musical adaptation?
Chernow is back with ""Grant"" (Penguin Press), out Tuesday, a doorstopper biography that resurrects a largely forgotten 18th president and war hero - the one on the $50, buried in a tomb in Riverside Park and dismissed by
some as a mere ""drunkard"" and ""a butcher.""
As 959-pages of ""Grant"" proves, he was so much more.
""Grant led nine lives, and all nine lives are extraordinary,"" Chernow told The Post. Though don't expect ""Grant: The
Musical"" to hit Broadway anytime soon. ""I don't think that Grant's life moves to a hip-hop beat,"" Chernow said.
""Hamilton was young, dashing and romantic. He lent himself perfectly to be the star of a musical. But I do think
that Grant's life is no less dramatic."" Here are nine facts from the book that prove his assertion:
Ulysses S. Grant wasn't his real name
Ulysses S. Grant was not the president's given name - he was born Hiram Ulysses Grant (with the ""unfortunate
initials"" H.U.G., leading to lots of schoolyard teasing). Grant dropped Hiram and went with Ulysses. The ""S"" came
later when a mistake in his West Point application gave him his middle initial. The name stuck and cadets called
him ""Uncle Sam Grant.""
He was a horse-riding prodigy
When Grant was a child, a circus came to his hometown of Georgetown, Ohio, and put out a challenge to all the
young men: Try to ride this wild pony. Ulysses mounted the pony with ease. His father recounted what happened
next: ""Presently out came a large monkey and sprang up behind Ulysses . . . Then the ringmaster made the monkey
jump onto Ulysses' shoulders, standing with his feet on his shoulders and with his hands holding onto his hair . . .
A few more rounds and the ringmaster gave it up; he had not come across a boy that the pony and the monkey
both could not dismount.""
He had a romantic side
Ulysses was profoundly attached to his wife, Julia Dent, and Julia in turn was Grant's most ardent advocate. The
two were so lovey-dovey that family members complained. In one of the book's most touching passages, Julia
admits that she visited a doctor about fixing her strabismus, a cross-eyed condition which made her so selfconscious
that she posed in profile. Grant's response: ""Did I not see you and fall in love with you with these same
eyes?""
He had his own personal Civil War
Julia came from a slave-owning family, while the Grants were ardent abolitionists. The infighting got so bad that
the Grants refused to attend their son's wedding. When Grant joined the Union army, Julia's brother joined the
Confederacy. Julia's father, Colonel Dent, swore that if ""his worthless son-in-law ever came on to his land, he would
shoot him as he would a rabbit.""
He abhorred bloodshed
Grant's detractors have long denigrated him as ""the butcher"" for the massive casualties the Union sustained on the
battlefield under his command. This deeply distressed the general. ""They call me the butcher,"" Grant said, ""but do
you know I sometimes could hardly bring myself to give an order of battle? When I contemplated the death and the
misery that were sure to follow, I stood appalled.""
He armed former slaves
Grant did not join the war as an ardent abolitionist - that came on the battlefield as he freed black men and women
from bondage. He became the first to arm former slaves, a controversial decision backed by Abraham Lincoln, who
said, ""The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the
rebellion at once."" Eventually 178,000 black troops fought for the North, many of them former slaves.
Grant and Lincoln's wives hated each other Though Lincoln and Grant became close friends - theirs was a very intense mutual-admiration society - the same
could not be said of wives Mary Todd Lincoln and Julia Grant. To be fair, Mary Todd was not the easiest person to
get along with (her nickname? ""Her Satanic Majesty."") After the war, when the Grants visited the capitol, the
Lincolns invited them to be their guests at Ford's Theatre. Julia refused because she ""objected strenuously to
accompanying Mrs. Lincoln."" This likely saved their lives, for Grant was high on John Wilkes Booth's to-kill list.
He was broke when he left the White House
Having sacrificed his military pension to pursue politics, Grant couldn't even afford to live in New York City after he
left office. A group of Wall Street admirers gave Grant a $250,000 retirement fund, and another donated over
$100,000 for him to buy his dream house at 3 E. 66th St., steps from Fifth Avenue with a view of the park. But in
New York he met misfortune again when he made a Wall Street ""friend"" named Ferdinand Ward, who convinced
him to invest in and lend his name to a brokerage firm. Grant and his three sons plunked down their life savings
into the firm - only to learn afterwards it was a Ponzi scheme. Grant, who thought he was worth $1 million, had only
$80 in the bank, while his wife was worth a mere $130 when the scheme went public in 1884.
Mark Twain published Grant's memoirs
Soon after he lost his fortune, Grant found out that he was sick, too, with cancer of the tongue. Though he hated
self-publicity, he decided to publish his memoirs to take care of his wife after his death. When author Mark Twain
heard this, he offered Grant a sweetheart publishing deal. Grant agreed, and wrote for four to five hours every day,
despite horrific throat pain. While writing, he stopped eating and dropped 65 pounds, nearly starved to death and
was zonked out on brandy and cocaine infusions (to drown out the pain) and somehow still managed to deliver
275,000 words in a year. Twain said that it was the cleanest copy he'd ever seen. The two-volume memoir,
published after Grant's death in 1885, was a smash hit that ""rivaled that other literary sensation of the 19th
century, 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' "" and set up Julia with a $400,000 nest egg until her death in 1902."
Bank of America,Wait for the Facts EDITORIAL," Oct 3, 2017",1,"Much of America woke up Monday to the horrific overnight news from Las Vegas of what now stands as the worst
mass shooting in US history.
Thousands were terrorized by the lone gunman who rained fire on an outdoor country-music festival from his
32nd-floor room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino before killing himself.
At least 59, including the killer, are dead and 527 more wounded, many critically.
It's natural to ask how something so shocking could have occurred. But this attack seems an even bigger-thanusual
mystery, with many unanswered questions.
In past incidents, a motive - ideology, personal grievance or mental illness - quickly became obvious. But no one
yet seems to have a clue as to what set Stephen Paddock off on a well-planned attack involving 18 to 20 weapons
- including difficult-to-obtain automatic rifles.
ISIS claimed responsibility, but presented no evidence and the FBI discounted it.
His family was mystified: Paddock had no political or religious affiliations, said his brother. He was not known as a
""gun guy"" and hadn't served in the military. He had no criminal history (though his father, a bank robber, was once
on the FBI's Most Wanted list) and left no notes or other writings.
Astonishingly, his brother says he was a millionaire real-estate investor. He lived in an upscale retirement
community and spent his time gambling - up to $30,000 a day in recent weeks.
Whatever the motive, this was, as President Trump rightly put it, ""an act of pure evil.""
Yet the lack of answers didn't stop some from rushing to judgment - whether it was the right-wing trolls who
misidentified the gunman or Democrats who immediately sought to politicize the massacre.
There will be time when more answers are known to move forward on substantive steps that might actually make a
difference.
For now, we can mourn the dead, pray for the wounded, hail the first responders and medical personnel who
performed so heroically - and let law enforcement do its job."
Bank of America,"Banks, Asla split"," Oct 3, 2017",0,"Tyra Banks and her photographer baby-daddy Erik Asla have split after five years, Page Six has exclusively learned.
We reported last July that the pair were struggling to keep their relationship on track following the birth of their
son, York Banks Asla, in January 2016. York was born via a surrogate, and Asla has daughters from a previous
relationship, to whom Banks has played stepmother. Now we're told they have decided to go their separate ways
and Asla has moved out of their LA mansion. A source close to the ""America's Got Talent"" host told us, ""It came

to work with Asla professionally. ""He is slated to shoot the photos for the opening credits of . . . the upcoming
'America's Next Top Model,' "" said the insider. Banks is returning to the long-running modeling reality competition
after a hiatus. Asla has shot for Allure, Harper's Bazaar and German Vogue. He met Banks when he was a guest on
the Norwegian version of ""America's Next Top Model."" Back in 2015, Banks said, ""We balance each other . . . He's

Bank of America,Why America buys into 'Shark Tank' Success of ABC's overlooked hit," Oct 1, 2017",0,"Tonight marks the two-hour season premiere of one of television's top-rated, most critically acclaimed shows - one
that curiously gets little media attention.
For nine seasons, ""Shark Tank"" - a competitive reality program in which inventors pitch to a panel of
multimillionaires (and one billionaire) - has been a consistent ratings winner despite ABC airing it in a Friday-night
graveyard slot. It's won four Emmys for Outstanding Structured Reality Program. Last August, the show retained its audience against NFL preseason games.
The success of ""Shark Tank"" has surprised even some sharks. ""I thought it was going to be a failure,"" Daymond
John told CNBC earlier this year. ""Nobody wants to listen to five businessmen and women talk! Who wants to
watch that?""
Turns out about 10 million people do, eager to learn about margins, franchising, licensing, intellectual property and
utility patents, amortization and customer acquisition, all of which somehow make edge-of-your-seat viewing.
Most compelling: ""Shark Tank"" is the American Dream in your living room week after week, a potent counterweight
to our ongoing economic trauma. It's hard to think of a more resonant-yet-aspirational reality show. So why doesn't
it garner as much media coverage as, say, ""The Bachelor,"" which equals and sometimes lags behind ""Shark Tank""
in viewers?
This disconnect seems another example of our two Americas: coastal elites forensically recapping and analyzing
esoteric ratings losers (most recently ""Twin Peaks"") while the heartland's tastes go ignored. The scant coverage
""Shark Tank"" does get isn't in People or Us Weekly but Forbes and Business Insider.
And that's ridiculous, because it's the most populist show on the air.
Created by legendary producer Mark Burnett (who toggles high-low, responsible for both ""Survivor"" and FX's
""Fargo""), ""Shark Tank"" is based on a Japanese reality show called ""Money Tigers."" In a shrewd cultural stroke,
nearly all of the judges on the American version are self-made. Two are Canadian; two the sons of immigrants.
Each fulfills a type.
Barbara Corcoran, the 68-year-old real-estate queen, is the flirty-pervy aunt. FUBU founder John is the streetwise
New Yorker. Lori Greiner is the ""Queen of QVC""; she and tech mogul Robert Herjavec are ""the warmblooded"" sharks.
Kevin O'Leary, center stage, is the villain, and billionaire and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban the star. (Guest
entrepreneurs this season include A-Rod and Richard Branson.)
The format is simple: Each segment features hopeful entrepreneurs entering the boardroom. They ask for a certain
amount of money ($150,000 for 20 percent of their company, for example) and make their pitch. The early seasons
of ""Shark Tank"" stand out for a considerably wilder casting process.
""The engineer who asked for $1 million to build a water tank in the ocean to turn seawater to gold - that's great TV,""
Corcoran recently told Inc. magazine. ""The guy with the Bluetooth device that you put in your ear and have to have
surgically removed when the battery ran out - great TV.""
One could argue that the show's newer breed of entrepreneur makes for even greater TV. ""Shark Tank"" premiered
on Aug. 9, 2009, one year after the economy crashed. As Washington bailed out the big banks and left average
Americans to suffer, ""Shark Tank"" promoted a feel-good narrative of American ingenuity and self-sufficiency.
One of the most memorable entrepreneurs was Season 5's Susan Petersen, who was seeking an investment for
her line of baby moccasins. Her origin story sold her: She had the vision but no money, so she asked her brother,
who owned a window-installation company, if he would give her the old windows he removed. She then took those
windows, broke all the glass, stripped aluminum from the frames by hand and took the material to the scrap yard,
where she got $200 for seed money.
Cuban told her it was the best startup story he'd ever heard and should be in every business textbook. In the
macro, it's about as American a story there is: one of grit and determination, Susan notable for not asking her welloff
brother for a loan. (So far as we know: It is, after all, a reality show.)
Forbes reported that as of this year, Petersen's baby shoes are a multimillion-dollar business.
""I love when people tell me that I can't do something,"" Petersen told Forbes. ""It ensures that, in fact, I will.""
If there's one true flaw in the Tank, it's this: The male sharks, even in 2017, often talk over, interrupt or dismiss the
female sharks.
""Don't wave your hand down on me,"" Corcoran said to Cuban one episode. ""I don't like it. Cut it out.""
Cuban said nothing. Such moments are small yet bracing reminders that even self-made female multimillionaires
still encounter sexism in the boardroom.
The show's overall tone can range from kind - sometimes sharks will encourage nervous contestants to counteroffer another shark, or take a rival deal that's better - to brutal. ""You are so full of s- -t!"" Cuban scolded one
hopeful, who slunk away with nothing. ""You're an a- -hole,"" O'Leary told another. ""Get the f- -k out of here.""
Yes, for all its optimism, the Tank can be as savage as corporate America. That's its magic formula: The average
viewer can vicariously experience their worst workplace fears and wildest dreams.
This year, the show self-reported $100 million in deals and 10,000 jobs created as a result. ""When you see people
come out here and see them be successful, you think, 'I can be, too,' "" Cuban told D magazine in 2014. ""And you get
advice and get the feedback, and, in aggregate, it's an education. That's important in this day and age, in this
economy.""
There's an education to be had here for a media more fascinated by both the lowbrow and elite tastes, somehow
still missing one of Middle America's favorite shows. They might consider taking a dip in the Tank."
Bank of America,TRACK &amp;amp; YIELD Nike US sales sag while Adidas remains hot," Sep 28, 2017",1,"The Nike-Adidas battle hasn't been much of a fight in recent quarters.
Nike, the world's best-selling sneaker brand, has stumbled badly in North America in recent quarters as its
designers have missed shifts in fashion and traditional retail chains, where the Beaverton, Ore., company had more
to lose.
In fact, North America sales for the Swoosh-meisters actually fell 3 percent in the most recent three-month period,
ended Aug. 31.
The stumble marked the first time in more than 10 quarters that Nike saw sales drop in No. 1 sales region.
Meanwhile, Adidas, paying special attention to its design, has posted an average North American sales gain of
nearly 26 percent over the past six quarters.
""Adidas has been successful in leveraging the spark from its fashion retro footwear resurgence into other
categories, like running and athletic apparel,"" Jefferies analyst Randal Konik wrote in a research update.
It remains to be seen if the federal criminal charges lodged against an Adidas executive tied to the college
basketball bribery scandal will have any affect on sales.
For Nike, ""[k]ey historical 'go-to' styles (like Roshe, Free and Jordan) do not appear to be performing strong enough
to back-fill revenue short-falls,"" Bank of America analyst Robert Ohmes wrote in a report.
Nike, realizing it has been losing its mojo, has recently amped up its direct-to-consumer sales in hopes of
sidestepping an ailing brick-and-mortar retail scene.
And Nike brand manager Trevor Edwards, on a Tuesday evening conference call to report fiscal first-quarter
results, said he was focusing on better reacting to fashion trends.
In August, in a stark example of Adidas' momentum and Nike's travails, the German sports brand leapfrogged over
Nike's Air Jordan brand to become the No. 2 selling sneaker in the US.
Nike is still the US sales leader, but Adidas' exploitation of America's fondness for athleisure apparel is making
retail history.
""We are in a sportswear-as-fashion cycle right now,"" Matt Powell, a sports industry analyst at the NPD Group, wrote
in a recent blog. ""Brands have been unable or unwilling to create more sportswear to feed this market, instead
making more performance products that have to be reduced to clear.""
While Nike has stuck to selling performance, it's not even among the Top 5 ""casual athletic"" footwear brands,
according to NPD.
In the first eight months of 2017, Adidas' athleisure emphasis has driven the company's share of the US market to
11.3 percent - up from 6.6 percent during the year-earlier period, according to NPD.
Nike's share dropped from 39 percent to 37 percent.
Investors have sent Adidas shares up 42 percent in 2017, while Nike shares, down 1.9 percent, to $52.67 on
Wednesday, are up just 3.6 percent. Adidas' ADRs rose 31 cents, to $110.51, on Wednesday.

Bank of America,Puerto Rico at a breaking point Islanders desperate as dam nears total collapse and supplies run low," Sep 26, 2017",1,"The Puerto Rico dam that was severely weakened by Hurricane Maria teetered on the brink of collapse Monday, as
residents endured another day without power and dwindling food and water.
Gov. Ricardo Rossell warned of a ""humanitarian crisis"" if Congress doesn't soon approve an aid package for the US
territory.
""We need something tangible, a bill that actually answers to our need right now,"" he told CNN.
A collapse of the earthen Guajataca Dam in the northwest part of the island could trigger a flood that would
threaten the lives of tens of thousands of people.
""Some of the dam has fallen apart,"" Rossell said. ""Now we are making sure that we can assess if the other part will
fall down, as well. It represents a great danger for about an estimated 70,000 people.""
With 91 percent of cellphone sites out of service, authorities went door-to-door, warning people of the potential
dam collapse.
""My action has been to order evacuation,"" the governor said. ""I'd rather be wrong on that front than do nothing and
having it fail and costing people their lives.""
It's been nearly a week since Hurricane Maria directly hit the island as a Category 4 storm, and residents were still truggling to access basic supplies such as clean drinking water and gas.
""The devastation in Puerto Rico has set us back nearly 20 to 30 years,"" Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner
Jenniffer Gonzalez told CBS News.
""The destruction of properties, of flattened structures, of families without homes, of debris everywhere. The
island's greenery is gone.""
House Speaker Paul Ryan on Monday pledged his support for the island, which is also in the midst of a $73 billion
debt crisis.
""The stories and images coming out of Puerto Rico are devastating,"" he said.
An aerial photo revealed a plea scrawled in large letters in the coastal town of Punta Santiago.
""S.O.S. We need water/food!!"" it read in Spanish.
And the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released nighttime satellite images taken before and
after the storm, with the later photo showing the powerless island in darkness.
Puerto Rican officials have confirmed at least 10 storm-related deaths on the island, and Maria was blamed for at
least 19 other fatalities across the Caribbean.
Metro Puerto Rico columnist Armando Valds described finding a ""heartbreaking"" situation at a 14-story nursing
home for low-income people in San Juan.
""Without food and an impossible climb down for most residents, some folks we spoke to couldn't remember when
they had last eaten,"" he wrote in a statement posted on Twitter.
""They had no drinking water. The ground-floor public restroom that was being used by many residents - it had
some water being on the lowest level - was a putrid mess.""
At the Puerto Rico Medical Center in San Juan, the island's largest public hospital, an official said help was badly
needed.
""If this is not taken care of, people are going to start dying,"" said Dr. Juan Carlos Sotomonte, a director of the
cardiovascular unit.
Hundreds of stranded travelers filled the stifling halls of San Juan Airport Monday, anxious to learn when they
could leave.
A nurse from Little Rock, Ark., told CBS News that they were in dire need of food, water and fans.
""It's inhumane,"" she said.
More celebs, meanwhile, were donating to relief efforts. Rapper Daddy Yankee said he gave $1 million to Feed
America and another $1 million to the Red Cross.
""I have my family there"" he told CNN. ""I have my wife, my daughter, and I live there still . . . and we really need your
help.""

Bank of America,"What's going on, Yellen"," Sep 24, 2017",1,"Let me explain to Fed chief Janet Yellen what is going on in the US economy. It appears she needs to know.
At her press conference on Wednesday, Yellen said of the inflation rate being suppressed, ""I will not say that the
committee clearly understands what the causes are of that.""
I am confounded by her committee's lack of basic understanding of the velocity of money and its effects on the
inflation rate.
Over the past 10 years, wages for America's middle class have been flat. Some studies suggest that when inflation is figured in, wages are at the same level as in 1995.
A large minority of the American workforce over the past eight years has lost decent-paying jobs that supported
them having a house, a car and medical insurance. Now they are forced to take multiple part-time jobs with no
benefits just to make ends meet.
Another aspect under her purview is the lack of interest paid on savings deposits. Banks have been giving pennies
for each $100 put into a savings account, all the while putting their cash on the Fed's balance sheet and collecting
a handsome rate of return.
Another point of contention: It's a convenient narrative to say that Amazon is decimating the retail sector. But let's
face it, many Americans who used to shop at malls can no longer aspire to own a new set of clothes each season.
First of all, they no longer have a job that requires anything more than a pair of yoga pants and a shirt, or a pair of
jeans and a team jersey.
These Americans have hard decisions each and every week on how to spend their meager wages.
They shop the rim of grocery stores - the outside ring where cheap protein lives - for milk, cheese and eggs. This is
how they survive, not thrive.
Everything I wrote suggests that money has no velocity now. So if a dollar earned does not translate into many
dollars spent as it moves through the system, because members in that system are either struggling with the
present or fearful of the future, then you have disinflation.
The lack of inflation is no mystery to me. All the policies over the past decade have curbed economic growth. Just
ask anyone you see shopping the rim."
Bank of America,BROADWAY&amp;amp; HERBSTREIT ESPN brings Kirk and crew to Times Square," Sep 22, 2017",1,"Kirk Herbstreit's biggest problem on Saturdays is he can't watch more college football.
It's a day that starts at 8:30 a.m. ET, no matter what time zone ""College GameDay"" is broadcasting from that day,
and ends well after midnight. And when it ends, Herbstreit could be hundreds or thousands of miles away from
where it began.
On Saturday, Herbstreit and the ""GameDay"" team - Desmond Howard, Lee Corso, Rece Davis and Maria Taylor - will
be starting in New York City for the first time, setting up shop outside the ""Good Morning America"" studios at
Broadway and 44th Street. Herbstreit said the idea originated ""three to four years ago"" with former host Chris
Fowler, who lives in the city, and was based on the big-school alumni who migrated to the area.
""Insane,"" Herbstreit said of the ""GameDay"" atmosphere, a show traditionally televised from a college campus. ""This
is my 22nd year. From when I was first on the show maybe we'd have 1,000 people around, to the point where it's
been up to the last eight to 10 years where it's 15,000-18,000 people.
""It just depends on where we are, what's at stake. We try and make it as friendly to the fan that goes and takes the
time to show up in terms of a big video and audio board. It's become an absolute zoo, just a real tailgate party
around our set."" ""GameDay"" will sometimes shoot from the site of the game Herbstreit will call that night on ESPN or ABC, but not
always. If the best game of the day is on CBS or FOX, ESPN will still go to that location for its pregame show. This
is a different animal, but presents Herbstreit with the same dilemma. How does he watch all the games he needs
to keep track of while flying across the country?
After ""GameDay"" goes off the air at noon, Herbstreit, Taylor and senior research producer Chris Fallica will fly from
Teterboro Airport in New Jersey on an ESPN-provided plane to Iowa City for the Iowa-Penn State game Saturday
night on ABC.
""If there's anything that's challenging it's keeping an eye on everything,"" the 48-year-old former Ohio State
quarterback said.
""I really pride myself on trying to watch these games live, as opposed to tapes or reading about it. When you
already know who wins it gives you a different feel, opposed to when you can watch it live.""
After reaching Iowa, Herbstreit will retreat to his hotel to catch up on the games of the afternoon, then will be on
the field around 7 p.m. ET for the Big 10 showdown. Even while calling that game, he will have eyes on two or three
other games on a bank of TVs he has with him in the booth.
""One of the few things I've mastered is an ability to talk about a game I am calling and watch two other games and
have a feel for what's going on in those games,"" Herbstreit said. ""My primary role at ESPN is trying to be plugged in
not only to 'GameDay,' but as much as the sport as I can be and seeing it with my own eyes.""
After calling that game and doing postgame spots for multiple ""SportsCenters,"" Herbstreit will ... watch some more
college football.
""You have to be a really sick college football fan,"" said Herbstreit, whose day does not end until he flies back to his
Nashville-area home.
""I have friends and family come out for a weekend and by the time we get to midnight, and I am still trying to find
that West Coast Pac-12 game most people are tapping out like, 'Bro enough. I've watched enough college football
to last me a month.' Me and Fallica can't get enough, though."""
Bank of America,Party crasher back," Sep 17, 2017",0,"Priyantha De Silva, the infamous criminal New York party crasher who infiltrated society soirees through a series

anniversary ""creeping out young fashionistas [and] claiming he was an Oscar-winning producer."" De Silva, who

are also the artwork.""
It's a good thing, since Prince currently finds himself up to his neck in them.
As put by Christopher Davis, one of the lawyers litigating against him, Prince is ""a notorious appropriation artist
who has made tens of millions of dollars over the course of his career by reproducing, modifying and preparing
derivative works of others, typically without permission . . . ""
The current spate of lawsuits - four of them - are all related to 2014's ""New Portraits"" show, originally mounted at
Gagosian. Works in the exhibition depicted pictures of regular folk and stars - including Kate Moss and Pamela
Anderson - plucked via screenshot from Instagram accounts, printed by Prince on canvases and tweaked with
written comments from Prince.
For decades, Prince has mostly been able to sidestep other artists who felt wronged by his usage - free-expression
laws afford a wide berth for adapting the visual work of others - but that trend may be reversing. In July, United
States District Judge Sidney H. Stein shut down a request for dismissal of a suit from professional photographer
Donald Graham, whose work was appropriated by Prince in ""New Portraits.""
Graham said that he pursued legal recourse for himself and hopes to set a standard that will aid others. ""Copyright
is a foundation for photographers to make a living,"" he told The Post.
Prince's lawyer, Joshua Schiller, insisted: ""We're saying that it's fair use.""
Bryan Wheelock, a partner at Harness, Dickey &Pierce, one of the country's oldest intellectual property law firms,
fails to see it that way, however: ""Wrapping an Instagram heading around somebody else's photograph, I don't see
how that is transformative. [Prince] had initial success, and I think it has emboldened him.
""He is a copyright infringer.""
LACKING traditional art training - the artist once admitted to Artforum, ""I had limited technical skills . . . Actually I
had no skills"" - Prince's career began after he moved from his childhood hometown of Boston to Manhattan in
1973 and got a job in the library at Time Inc. There, he snipped and archived magazine pages, foreshadowing his
later work.
He started getting modest art-world attention in the late 1970s and early '80s for pieces such as spot-on
reproductions of cigarette ads. In 1983, Prince re-photographed a 1975 shot of a naked 10-year-old Brooke Shields
and called it ""Spiritual America"" (the title was copied from an Alfred Stieglitz photo). It was first shown in the front
window of a Lower East Side store rented by Prince for this single purpose. arry Gross, the shot's original photographer, won a $2,000 settlement from Prince and an agreement that he
would be credited every time the appropriated version was shown at the Whitney - a promise Prince reneged on in
'92. (After Gross pointed it out, Whitney employees credited him.)
In 2014, Prince's copy of Gross' photo sold at auction for $3,973,000.
At least Gross got something. Sam Abell fared less well when Prince, in 1989, ""re-photographed"" (Prince's words) a
Marlboro ad - originally shot by Abell in the 1970s - that depicted the brand's famous cowboy.
""His appropriation of my photo was the lead image at MoMA,"" Abell told The Post. ""The whole thing was surreal
and turned the world on its head for me.""
Prince's image, called ""Untitled (Cowboy),"" sold for $701,000 at Sotheby's in 2014. Abell had relinquished all rights
to Philip Morris (the tobacco brand's parent company), so he could not seek compensation, nor could fellow
Marlboro photographers - and Prince targets - Jim Krantz and Jim Braddy.
Abell joked that, thanks to Prince, a dream of his came true: ""I had a lifetime ambition to have a show at the
Museum of Modern Art."" But, he added, ""People talk about his work and the photo they use is mine. It has been a
barnacle in my life.""
In 2002, Prince began creating his now famous ""Nurse"" paintings, based on images appropriated from the covers
of midcentury pulp novels. The originals were by journeyman illustrators such as Mort Engle, whose illustration for
the book ""Millionaire Nurse"" inspired a Prince painting of the same name which sold for $3.301 million at auction in
2014.
To be fair, Prince did make his nurses look more mysterious than the book-cover originals by covering the lower
halves of the women's faces. The alteration arose by accident; after wiping excess paint off a piece, Prince was left
with what resembled a surgical mask.
One canvas in the series, ""Nurse of Greenmeadow,"" went for $8.6 million back in 2015.
DESPITE apparent similarities, Prince relies on a legal doctrine known as ""fair use"" that deems artistic
appropriation permissible so long as the new work includes a ""new expression, meaning or message,"" a complex
concept that can be difficult to disprove.
With the exception of five (out of 30) photos that French photographer Patrick Cariou sued Prince over - earning an
out-of-court settlement in 2014 - Prince has managed to get away with it.
But the most controversial of Prince's audacious appropriations has led to the lawsuits that just might pierce his
seemingly Teflon armor.
The artist's ""New Portraits"" show was comprised of canvases emblazoned with printed portraits of model Candice
Swanepoel and singer Sky Ferreira, among other celebrities, as well as people you've never heard of. Some were
selfies; others were taken by professional photographers.
New Yorker magazine art critic Peter Schjeldahl wrote that his response to the work was ""something like a wish to
be dead."" Artforum headlined its review, ""Richard Prince Sucks."" Still, collectors snapped up the works at $90,000
each.
Three pro photographers are now pursuing lawsuits for copyright infringement. Dennis Morris claims a photo he
shot of Sid Vicious was pilfered by Prince, while Donald Graham is troubled over use of his ""Rastafarian Smoking a
Joint."" Eric McNatt's shot was of former Sonic Youth bassist Kim Gordon - a close pal of Prince's.
The fourth litigant is Ashley Salazar, a makeup artist; Prince used one of her selfies, which she copyrighted after
the fact.
""He used her work, without her authorization, to make a profit,"" her attorney, Douglas Linde, told The Post. ""That is
against the law."" Linde, who originally filed court papers for Salazar and Morris in California, then pulled them, said
he will re-file in New York ""imminently.""
""I don't know why Richard Prince thinks he can get away with using other people's pictures. His attitude flies in the
face of copyright law,"" Linde added.
""Usually a defendant blames somebody else. Prince is not claiming that his assistant made a mistake. He takes
full responsibility."" SO does Prince create art, or mere reproduction? Though he may be more audacious than most, he's following an
elusive tradition that goes back at least to 1917, when Marcel Duchamp submitted a urinal - not of his own
creation - for an art show.
Michael Hort, a Manhattan art collector who has ""a couple of"" Prince's ""Nurse"" paintings, shows little sympathy for
the litigants.
""Richard's art is great and original; you look at his pieces and think about them,"" Hort said. With the ""Nurse""
paintings, ""[he] took books that are completely discarded and made [their covers] into something original. You look
at the nurse and wonder what she is about.
""[Prince] appropriates these images and elevates them.""
Kembrew McLeod, a communications professor at the University of Iowa who specializes in copyright, has mixed
emotions. ""What Richard Prince does is valid,"" he said. ""While I would defend Prince's ability to appropriate, I find
what he does to be a form of trolling.""
In fact, Prince seems to love being a troll. In January, days after President Trump's inauguration, the artist said that
he had returned a $36,000 payment to Ivanka Trump - his way of ""denouncing"" an artwork he had previously sold to
her. The irony is that the work, which is part of the ""New Portraits"" series and depicts an Instagram photo of Ivanka
getting her hair and makeup done, was commissioned by its subject, too.
And the artist seems to have a good sense of humor about people trolling him. After Prince exploited an Instagram
image by pinup collective SuicideGirls - of a tattooed and topless female dipping her tongue into a cat-food bowl -
the group retaliated by knocking off Prince's knockoff and selling the pic for $90 instead of $90,000.
""We sold 8,000 of them and gave the profits to [digital-rights group] Electronic Frontier Foundation,"" said
SuicideGirls co-founder Sean Suhl. ""Richard Prince responded. He sent us one of his $90,000 prints, signed, with a
note saying that we were clever and that he appreciated our sense of humor.""
PRINCE, who is married to the artist Noel Grunwaldt, seemingly can afford to give away some of his work. He
reportedly is worth around $30 million and owns two town houses in Manhattan, a house in the Hamptons (he
once reigned as club champion at the Bridge Golf Club in Southampton) and a compound in Rensselaerville, NY.
Knowing this, some of the people who aren't comfortable with Prince's appropriation wonder if the wronged
parties' reactions are motivated by the potential payoff.
""Some of these people probably had not even heard of Richard Prince,"" said McLeod. ""But it's not surprising that
they want to sue him once they find out that he is a successful artist with the money to pay off.""
Marlboro photographer Abell - who, again, was not able to sue Prince - agreed. ""This is all about money. If his
appropriation was taped to somebody's refrigerator, nobody would care.""
Still, some collectors are losing interest. ""Richard is taking people's art and using it for his own,"" said Asher
Edelman, whose company, Artemus, finances art purchases. Edelman ""used to collect Richard Prince heartily in the
'80s."" But now, he added, ""I would not buy his work because of this.""
Prince appears unfazed by the heat on him. He told Vulture, ""I'm not going to change, I'm not going to ask for
permission . . . I sometimes spend more time in my lawyer's office than in my studio.""
And he seems to spend a lot of that time rolling his eyes. He has said of a past plaintiff's attorney, ""My attitude
was like, 'Dude, this is my artwork and you . . . are a f- -king square.' """
Bank of America,A New Ethnic Cleansing," Sep 14, 2017",1,"A vast pogrom is now under way in Burma, a k a Myanmar, as the military junta renamed the country. The ethnic
cleansing has driven roughly 370,000 minority Rohingya out of the country, with hundreds of their villages leveled.
Officially, the perpetrators are unknown, though it's hard to see how any independent force could've formed
without the government's active support. And Amnesty International and other human-rights groups accuse the
military of using land mines along the border to target the Rohingya as they flee.
The horrors go beyond villages burned to the ground and/or attacked with gunfire and mortars - to beheaded
children and civilians burned alive.
""There are no more villages left, none at all,"" Rashed Ahmed, a farmer from a hamlet in Maungdaw Township, told
The New York Times. ""There are no more people left, either. It is all gone.""
The trigger was Rohingya militants' Aug. 25 attacks on government forces, which have now been met with
unrelenting, merciless vengeance against the entire Rohingya populace of more than 1 million.
The government of the Buddhist-majority land doesn't recognize the mostly Muslim Rohingyas as citizens, and
seems intent on driving them into Bangladesh, which is staggering under the influx of refugees.
Here in America, Sen. John McCain is moving to zero out spending on US military cooperation with Burma - which
won't stop the pogrom before it's over.
Longtime political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi is now the ""first state counselor"" - theoretically the country's leader.
But she's silent as bodies of women and children wash up on river banks.
In her speech accepting the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, she said the world should be ""free of the displaced, the
homeless and the hopeless."" But her spokesman calls the violence a national-security issue - implying that it's
under control of the military junta that plainly still really runs the country.
In the words of one Bangladeshi Border Guard: ""It breaks all records of inhumanity."""
Bank of America,In short supply iPhone X to be hard to get: analyst," Sep 12, 2017",0,"On the eve of the new iPhone's big unveiling, rumors continue to swirl that it will be dogged by delays.
Apple will only be able to produce 10,000 units a day of its hotly anticipated iPhone X, KGI Securities analyst Ming-
Chi Kuo said in a research note that was obtained by MacRumors on Monday.
As a result, the new phone - slated to be unveiled on Tuesday at Apple's new headquarters, with forecasts of a
$1,000-plus price tag - will be ""in severe short supply,"" the analyst predicts.
The research note added that the gold version of the iPhone X will face even more production difficulties than the
standard black and white models, with Kuo suggesting the production issues are so severe that it might not go on
sale until a later date.
Apple is expected to announce three new iPhones on Tuesday: the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and the iPhone X. The
iPhone 8 is expected to be similar to the 7 but with upgraded internal tech, while the iPhone X will feature a nearly
edge-to-edge OLED screen - a first for the iPhone - as well as facial recognition and a host of new features.
Reports of production issues almost always accompany an impending iPhone release, and Apple usually
surpasses expectations. But this year has seen more supply warnings than usual.
Kuo forecast manufacturing issues back in June, anticipating that shoppers would be especially affected by the shortages during the holiday shopping season.
In July, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts slashed their forecast for full-year shipments of iPhones by 11
million due to concerns surrounding manufacturing hiccups related to the iPhone X's fingerprint-recognition
features and 3D facial recognition technologies.
While all the rumors bouncing around the tech world won't become reality until Apple tells us so, the good news is
that the rampant leaks will end in less than 24 hours.
Apple's unveiling will start Tuesday at 1 p.m. EDT at the newly constructed Steve Jobs Theater at the company's
HQ.
Apple shares on Monday gained 1.8 percent, to $161.50."
Bank of America,DON'T 'BANK' ON IT Heist busts way up; 86% of cases solved," Sep 10, 2017",0,"Bank robbers might want to look for a new line of work.
Authorities have solved bank heists 86 percent of the time this year, up from a ""clearance rate"" of 79 percent in
2015-2016.
There have been 91 bank robberies in the city from Jan. 1 to Aug. 13, a 20 percent drop from the same period last
year, when Willie Sutton wannabes struck 114 times, according to FBI data.
The FBI/NYPD Joint Violent Crimes Task Force made 87 bank-robbery arrests so far this year, up from 77 for the
same period last year.
But it's not because bank bandits are getting dumber.
""Technology has allowed the banks to provide a variety of different defenses to bank robberies,"" Michael Osborn,
assistant special agent in charge of the unit, told The Post.
Motion sensors, surveillance cameras, silent teller alarms, window monitors that detect shattered glass, exploding
dye packs and GPS tracking devices tucked inside the stolen loot are among the first lines of defense.
""The FBI and NYPD are collaborating on all levels to maximize resources dedicated to bank-robbery investigations,""
Osborn said. ""We are proactive in collecting and analyzing intelligence, and then sharing the information with area
banks.""
Osborn said bank robbers can range from criminals in dire financial straits to drug users looking for a quick fix.
Even MMA fighters - like Sergio daSilva, who was pinched two weeks ago after allegedly robbing $46,000 on Aug.
24 from a Queens Citibank - have joined the heist parade.
Joseph Giacalone, a retired NYPD detective sergeant and professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, called
bank robbery a ""losing proposition.""
""With all the technology out there helping cops solve bank robberies, one would have to ask, why are they still
trying?"" Giacalone said. ""It might point to a more nefarious reason, the opioid addiction crisis.""
Giacalone added: ""People still think that banks have hundreds of thousands stuffed in tiny drawers by the tellers.
Here's a news flash for would-be robbers: they don't.""
FBI Agent Kevin Ponder said the bank jobs ""run the gamut"" from ""sophisticated"" strikes to a bungling amateur who
passed a note to a teller ""with his real name on the deposit slip.""
In July, a ""very bad bank robber"" from New Jersey allegedly tried to hold up three Manhattan banks over a two-day
period, but came up empty each time.
The first failed attempt came July 18 at a Bank of America branch on Delancey Street, when he passed a note to a
teller demanding big bills ""or you will get shot."" The unfazed teller locked her drawer and walked away, police said.
The next morning, the thief targeted a Chase Bank on Delancey and passed a note threatening he had a gun, but
the teller went to speak to a manager. The third time was not the charm: He came away from a Citibank near Astor Place without a cent, police said.
Cops arrested Richard Callison, 22, on July 19 and charged him in the three botched heists."
Bank of America,"Viewer losses leaving Comcast, Disney ... Cut &amp;amp; pasted"," Sep 8, 2017",1,"Comcast and Disney shares tanked Thursday after top executives at the media giants said cord cutting continues
to slam their results.
Comcast got hit harder, in response to Executive VP Matthew Strauss' prediction that the country's largest cable
company could lose 100,000 to 150,000 video subscribers this quarter.
The stock plunged 6.2 percent - its sharpest decline in six years - to close at $38.60.
Disney, whose ESPN network has been dogged by subscriber losses, wasn't far behind, its shares falling 4.4
percent to close at $97.06. CEO Bob Iger admitted that fiscal 2017 earnings per share would be ""roughly in line""
with the $5.72 generated in fiscal 2016.
Analysts had been expecting a 3 percent gain, which would have taken Disney's EPS to $5.88 for the fiscal year
ending Oct. 1.
The disconcerting comments were made at an investor conference hosted by Bank of America Merrill Lynch in
Beverly Hills, Calif. But they were part of presentations showing the companies moving in different directions.
Investors dinged Comcast for being comfortable - if not complacent - as a traditional media company. Yet they
took down Disney for seeking to reinvent itself as an over-the-top distributor of its own content.
Comcast's Strauss admitted that with skinny bundles and over-the-top options proliferating, the quarter was the
most competitive in memory. But he also blamed some anticipated subscription losses on ""terrible storms"" in
Texas and Florida, two key Comcast territories.
Meanwhile, Wells Fargo analyst Marci Ryvicker blamed Comcast's stock dip on Strauss' lack of clarity about
subscriber trends.
""Unfortunately, we don't know how much is competition and how much is weather,"" she wrote in an update.
Iger also blamed the weather, in part, for the flat EPS forecast for Disney's fiscal year.
Hurricane Irma is causing cancellations at Disney World in Orlando and has jettisoned three Disney Cruises.
Moreover, Disney lacked a major ""Star Wars"" feature this year and is absorbing the cost of ESPN's new $1.4 billiona-
year contract to broadcast NBA games - almost three times the amount paid under the previous deal.
Disney's investment in BAMTech - the company that powers streaming for MLB, HBO, NHL and WWE - was cited as
an earnings drag as well.
""We saw in that platform exactly what we needed,"" Iger said of the cornerstone of Disney's ambitious videostreaming
plans, which include two direct-to-consumer apps - one for Disney and one for ESPN - to be launched
over the next two years.
The Disney app will serve as the company's traditional pay-TV window - a commitment reinforced by Iger's
announcing the service would also stream Disney's ""Star Wars"" and Marvel productions.
As of last month, the company was undecided about whether it would continue to license the premium content to
Netflix.
But on Thursday Iger said, ""We're going to launch big and we're going to launch hot."""
Bank of America,Wells 'foolery' [Exclusive] Loans guys duped clients into higher rates: source," Sep 5, 2017",1,"Wells Fargo apparently had more than one way to cheat customers who were refinancing their homes.
The scandal-plagued bank's Beverly Hills, Calif., branch routinely talked clients into paying higher interest rates in
order to avoid fees for delays in processing mortgage-refinancing deals, a whistleblower told The Post.
That's despite the fact that Wells Fargo's understaffed team of loan officers at the Beverly Hills office were usually
responsible for the processing delays, according to Frank Chavez, a former loan officer who has blown the whistle
on other questionable tactics at the nation's third-biggest bank.
The latest accusation comes to light less than a week after a federal class-action suit accused the beleaguered
bank of delaying mortgage loans and refinancings - and then tricking customers into paying extension, or ""rate
lock,"" fees in order to keep their agreed-upon interest rate.
As an alternative to those fees, which could easily surpass $1,000 for a $400,000 home, loan officers frequently
suggested bumping up the mortgage rate by as much as a quarter of a percentage point - a hike which, over the
long run, could cost customers far more.
""It sucked for everybody except the managers, who were looking good because they were keeping their expenses
down,"" Chavez told The Post.
The scheme was widespread until late 2015, when it was being used for ""the vast majority of these loans,"" Chavez
said. The tactics were unlikely to have been isolated to the busy office, which could clear over $1 billion a year in
new mortgages, he added.
The accusations, which haven't been previously reported, are the latest revelation that the San Francisco-based
lender, now led by CEO Tim Sloan, went to extraordinary lengths, including angering some of its wealthiest
customers, to pad its bottom line.
When clients confronted with fees complained that they weren't at fault for a delayed refi, loan officers typically
went to their managers for permission to cover the cost of extending a rate lock - and were typically denied.
Instead, Wells loan officers were given permission to strike another deal: Charge a slightly higher interest rate in
exchange for a ""credit"" to cover the rate-lock extension fee.
""You'd make the borrower suck it up,"" Chavez said, noting that customers who refused were typically faced with
another home appraisal that could cost $500 alone. ""It's either that or walk, and borrowers don't want to go
through with this all over again at Bank of America.""
""It is common practice across the industry for customers to select - at application or later in the process - some
combination of interest rate and points based on their individual circumstances and preferences,"" Tom Goyda, a
bank spokesman, told The Post.
""We continue to work through a comprehensive review of our past practices regarding rate-lock extensions and will
address additional steps for our customers as appropriate,"" he said."
Bank of America,Mets lend a hand," Sep 3, 2017",1,"HOUSTON - The Mets did some relief work on Friday that exemplified the meaning of charitable actions. There
were no cameras, no photo ops, no posing. This was a simple pitch: Do whatever we can in whatever small way we
can.
Some Mets went to churches, some went to food banks. Whatever they could, wherever they could.
""I felt we wished we could do more than we did,"" said rookie Dominic Smith, who served at the Houston Food Bank,
the largest in America. ""A lot of people out here are supporting each other. A lot of people are volunteering. It does
hurt your heart to see people go through these tough times. You just do what you can and try to help.""
A.J. Hinch, the Astros manager, gave a special shout out to the Mets while addressing the crowd prior to the start
of Saturday's day-night doubleheader. The Mets, Hinch noted, helped in a city ""they rarely come to and for that we
are forever grateful.""
In all, estimates said about 25-30 Mets players, coaches and team personnel aided in the Hurricane Harvey relief

several teammates, including Brandon Nimmo. ""It was really nice to see people helping people.""
Both d'Arnaud and Nimmo told of a truck that arrived stocked with supplies from Wisconsin.
""We unloaded cars that were coming in. Had a truck come in from Wisconsin that was loaded with supplies,
unloaded that,"" Nimmo said. ""We were helping people get to their car with supplies. They set up like a Walmart so
people could grab what they needed. We helped do things like sort clothes. We were just happy we were able to

Bank of America,"MOVE OVER, GIGI &amp;amp; BELLA There's a hot new sister act in the modeling world: the Hamlins"," Sep 3, 2017",0,"So there are these two sisters - the daughters of one of the stars of ""The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills."" The
older sibling is a classic California blonde. The younger one is a brunette with a wicked pout and edgy style. And
they're ready to take the fashion world by storm.
Sound familiar?
Delilah and Amelia Hamlin are ready to follow in the footsteps of mega models Gigi and Bella Hadid, with whom
they have a lot in common.
The photogenic daughters of soap-opera actress-turned-""RHOBH"" firebrand Lisa Rinna and '80s ""LA Law""
heartthrob Harry Hamlin, Delilah, 19, and Amelia, 16, are auditioning for their first New York Fashion Week shows
this week. And they're giving the Hadids a run for their money - even if the Hamlins insist the similarities are only
on the surface.
""We're our own people. We have similar hair colors, and that's it,"" Amelia said. ""We really respect and look up to
[Gigi and Bella] - they're such hard workers.""
The Hamlin sisters' Instagram accounts are filled with ultra-glam snaps of them traveling all over the world, from
Tokyo to Paris, London to New York. Their look is sporty and sexy and street, with their bellies rarely covered. But
these two teens haven't exactly been living the Hollywood wild-child life. Until recently, Amelia was working at a
deli, of all things. ""I was making toast, frozen yogurt and tuna salad for customers,"" she said.
And up until her 18th birthday, Delilah had an 11 p.m. curfew.
""My parents really wanted us to be responsible and love ourselves,"" she said. ""My dad didn't let me wear makeup
until I was 13!""
Their parents' celebrity, the sisters say, wasn't a big deal. ""I didn't know our parents were famous,"" said Amelia of
her younger years. ""[Growing up] in Beverly Hills, that's the norm.""
The girls also don't give a second thought to the reality-show cameras that follow their mom.
""It's so normal for us,"" said Amelia, who is home-schooled. ""Ever since I was 8 we were filming. It's just our
environment now.""
Gigi Hadid began modeling when she was 2 years old, but the Hamlins' parents didn't let them model until last
year. Since then, their careers have taken off. Delilah walked in Tommy Hilfiger's fall 2017 show in Los Angeles and
Dolce &Gabbana's fall 2017 outing in Milan. And, as of June, when Amelia joined IMG, they're both signed to the
high-profile agency that also reps the Hadids.
Together, the Hamlins have already been featured in Town &Country and Vogue Taiwan. But they didn't always
dream of being models.
Growing up, Amelia wanted to be an astronaut and Delilah wanted to be a secret agent. One day, in 2015, a bored
Delilah asked Amelia to take Polaroids of her in their Beverly Hills back yard. The older sister uploaded them on
Instagram, and then a modeling agency messaged her through the app to ask for a meeting. Now, Delilah counts
Tyra Banks as one of her biggest inspirations.
""Before I ever wanted to be a model I watched 'America's Next Top Model' - I was insecure then and seeing [host
Banks] embrace her [curvy] body was really inspiring,"" Delilah said.
Amelia said the sisters' style has changed since the start of their careers.
""Before, we were putting random colors together, and now we keep it simple and chic,"" she said. ""We like to be edgy
and the only ones in the room wearing what we're wearing.""
Like most siblings, Amelia and Delilah don't always get along. In their younger days, Amelia, who's naturally more
outgoing and precocious, would huff at her shy sister.
""We were very different - I secluded myself from everyone and always wanted to play dolls,"" Delilah said.
""She'd beg me to play dolls when she was 10 [and I was 7], and I told her there was no way I'd do that,"" said Amelia.
But now they say there's no sibling rivalry, especially when it comes to their careers.
""People always ask if there's competition [between us],"" Amelia said. ""No, we're on the same team. Her
accomplishments are my accomplishments.""
Pretty soon, they'll be temporarily separated. Delilah, who graduated from private Halstrom Academy in LA this
past spring, is enrolled at NYU for the spring 2018 semester and will study criminal psychology.
""I like the idea of the city as a campus - I love New York City and I work a lot here so I thought it was the perfect
college,"" Delilah said.
And she might have a roommate in a couple of years. ""She already has a bed for me in her apartment,"" said Amelia."

As the Lone Star State deals with the devastating aftermath of the record-busting storm, celebrities and corporate

That includes NFL star J.J. Watt of the Houston Texans, who started an online fund-raiser Sunday with a goal of
$200,000.
But by Friday, he'd raised more than $15.4 million.
""Absolutely incredible,"" the defensive end tweeted this week. ""The most difficult times bring out the best in
humanity.""
Comedian Ellen DeGeneres gave $1 million to Watt's fund-raiser and rapper Drake donated $200,000, saying,
""Houston has always been like a second home to me.""
New York sports teams have stepped up as well, with the Giants donating $1 million among Americares, the
American Red Cross and the Houston Food Bank.
The Mets spent the day before their Saturday day-night doubleheader in Houston against the Astros volunteering
in the community.
A slew of celebrities have offered hefty donations to aid the victims of the storm, which has left at least 47 dead
and damaged more than 156,000 homes.
Actress Sandra Bullock (American Red Cross) and Leonardo DiCaprio (United Way Recovery Fund) each donated
$1 million.
Pop star Miley Cyrus donated $500,000 as part of her Happy Hippie Foundation - and got emotional on ""The Ellen

Kardashian family, who pledged $500,000 between the Red Cross and the Salvation Army.
Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez announced they'd donate a collective $50,000.
Instead of pledging cash, singer Miranda Lambert spearheaded efforts to rescue more than 100 dogs from
Houston-area animal shelters. Harvey has also brought out the generosity of companies across the country.

Bank of America,NOW IN 'SEASONS' The new Grill at the former Four Seasons is an energized reboot of a storied space," Aug 30, 2017",1,"THE Grill's a thrill.
After a year of labor under the watchful eye of the Landmarks Preservation Commission - and $32 million pumped
into the former Four Seasons space - the fabled Grill Room has been reborn for 21st-century New York.
Seagram Building landlord Aby Rosen and Major Food Group restaurateurs Jeff Zalaznick and chef Mario Carbone
have rescued the storied venue from its mausoleumlike air.
Since the Four Seasons closed in July 2016, the world has been waiting to see what would become of the beloved
but exhausted Grill and Pool rooms, designed by architect Philip Johnson in the 1950s.
Nearly four months since opening, the Grill hasn't quite become the power-lunch scene of yore. But its triumphant
renewal should gratify anyone with an appetite for classic American cuisine or great architecture.
(The former Pool Room, now called the Pool and helmed by chef Rich Torrisi, recently started dinner service.) The
room's history might drive off New Yorkers who either hated the Four Seasons or feel no reboot could measure up.
Repeat visits by The Post suggest that the Grill's new identity will win over doubters on both sides.
The atmosphere The space's iconic landmarked elements are all there - only better.
Johnson's French walnut walls, rippling aluminum curtains and cracked-glass panels still project big-city power.
They've now been burnished, and better lit, to dazzle even more than they did in 1959.
The space could do without the fussy floral arrangement Rosen installed between the square bar and sculptor
Richard Lippold's dangling bronze sculpture.
And replicas of the original booths feel a bit too plush.
Overall, though, architect Annabelle Selldorf's restoration has made the venue gleam with revelatory energy.
So does a subtle tweak to the seating. The total number of seats - 106 - hasn't changed. But eight have shifted to
the main floor, leaving eight fewer on the mezzanine.
The now-discreet upper level draws business guys in suits, often trailed up the stairs by a $3,000 Jeroboam of
Champagne.
On the main floor, meanwhile, the extra diners create a hubbub that was missing back when David Rockefeller and
Henry Kissinger were running the world over $40 baked potatoes.
Although servers sport Tom Ford tuxedos, I spotted some diners in T-shirts thanks to a no-dress-code policy.
The prices The Grill isn't for penny pinchers. But its masters-oftheuniverse menu - including ""steaks, chops and
birds"" priced at $48 to $59 - doesn't have to break the bank.
Some of the best dishes are easily large enough for two people to split.
Those include the mighty prime rib, which two of us were unable to finish on three occasions, and the huge slabs
of tender Amish ham steak ($39). Some appetizer portions are generous, as well. Try splitting the pasta a la presse
($29), deliciously drenched in duck jus, and the steak-and-anchovy tartare ($26), satisfying and light on the tongue.
Must-have dishes The Grill calls itself a ""historically based"" chophouse. Still, modern accents set the menu apart.
Parker House rolls are so built-in buttery that to spread more on them would be promiscuous. Prime rib ($62) is the superstar: It's a Creekstone Farms 14-ouncer that's first spit-roasted, then ovencrisped and
served with a medley of condiments. The dish includes a beefy bone that's slow-cooked and smoked, presented on
a separate plate, and was the best mammal matter I've tasted all year.
I flipped, too, over spicy, soul-satisfying blue-crab gumbo ($28), brimming with Dungeness crab, okra, andouille
sausage and green onions. Saucy chicken ""a la queen"" ($38) was a shrewdly elevated country-club classic.
Simple-sounding lamb chops with curry notes ($59) and honey-mustard duckling ($41) are exemplary of the sharp
execution Carbone also demonstrates at his downtown eateries, Carbone and Dirty French.
Meaty cuts of Scottish salmon ($45) and minted black bass ($39) were more than worth their prices.
The wine situation A quick glance at pages and pages of unaffordable bottles can cause the heart to sink. But take
a closer look: Quite a few gems are tucked in there - including four vintages of La Palette Rouge, a Provenal blend,
priced at $150 and under. The luscious 2008, with a Bandol-like nose and notes of plum, truffle and spices, is just
$105.
The famous trolleys Wheeled units that rove the floor only succeed about half the time. The cart carrying prime rib
works:
Tableside carving lets you pick your preferred cut and condiments. But the trolley bearing a scary duck press
merely shows jus being squeezed from the bird before it rolls back into the kitchen for saucing. Why?
The service Although friendly, servers drove me nuts with overrehearsed history lectures.
Each time my party ordered the wild-mushroom omelet, for instance, we endured a metronomic spiel: ""This room
was the first in America, in 1959, to serve fresh mushrooms."" Who cares? It's 2017."

Bank of America,A CUSTOMER DIS-SERVICE Little-known lawsuit could mark another Wells disaster," Aug 24, 2017",0,"Wells Fargo Chief Executive Tim Sloan has reassured customers he's doing everything he can to make up for past
wrongs - except, apparently, if they got hit with excessive overdraft fees.
Lawyers for the embattled bank will appear before an Atlanta federal appeals court on Thursday to argue that more
than a million customers possibly dinged by excessive overdraft charges shouldn't be allowed to join a 9-year-old
class-action lawsuit.
If Wells Fargo succeeds, the bank could be spared from having to pay more than $1 billion in restitution, people
close to the case said.
The Atlanta appeal, dating from a 2008 lawsuit filed by five depositors, involves reordering - a once widely
practiced custom in which banks, faced with multiple withdrawals on the same day, would first clear the ones with
the highest amounts.
That would raise the likelihood of increased overdraft fees.
Many large banks faced similar depositor lawsuits. Each one settled its suit.
Wells Fargo alone has kept up the fight - exposing the bank, if it loses, to more nasty headlines.
""The fact that they're still fighting desperately against consumers they screwed is a sure sign they still don't get it,""
Ira Rheingold, executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates, told The Post. ""They're
fighting tooth and nail against people who were cheated by them from getting proper redress.""
The San Francisco bank is no stranger to self-inflicted controversies.
Last year, the bank admitted that it had opened 2 million potentially fake accounts and credit cards in order to
boost the company's bottom line - a scandal that led to the resignation of its last CEO in October.
Since then, the bank:
n Withheld disclosing a report on forcing auto-loan customers to buy unneeded and costly insurance;
n Paid $108 million to settle a whistleblower suit alleging Wells charged veterans hidden fees to refinance
mortgages;
n Disclosed a federal regulatory probe into allegations it improperly closed and froze accounts, leaving customers
without access to their money;
n Admitted that the number of potential fake accounts will likely be larger than originally thought.
Then, on Wednesday, Sloan, in a companywide letter, told employees to brace themselves for more bad headlines
""within a few weeks.""
""Wells Fargo was always the bank that litigated the hardest and settled the least,"" Rheingold said. ""They always
had trouble settling these matters because they would never be able to admit they did something wrong."" That
tack has cost Wells Fargo plenty recently - hurting both its finances and its reputation.
Reordering, the subject of the Atlanta case, is no longer used by banks. Here's how it worked: If a customer had $50 in a checking account and bought a $10 breakfast and a $15 lunch, and then spent $55 on
dinner, those charges would be reordered so that the most expensive one was processed first.
That would result in three overdraft charges, typically $35 each.
If the bank cleared the transaction in chronological order, there would have been enough in the account to pay for
breakfast and lunch - and just the dinner expense would have resulted in an overdraft fee.
Wells Fargo previously fought a similar case involving only California depositors who were ripped off by overdraft
fees, but was ultimately ordered by the Supreme Court last year to pay a $203 million settlement.
Bank of America settled similar charges in 2011 for $410 million. JPMorgan Chase paid $110 million in 2012, TD
Bank settled for $62 million in 2014 and Capital One paid $38 million in 2015.
The Thursday hearing in Atlanta is crucial for the bank. Wells Fargo claims customers agreed to settle all disputes
via arbitration when they opened their accounts.
That should prevent them from being able to join a class-action lawsuit being litigated in Miami, the bank argues.
If the bank wins, it would force the more than 1 million potential class-action members to file arbitration cases
individually - a costly and time-consuming endeavor for customers.
Fewer victims are likely to pursue an arbitration case, sources said, thus saving the bank some cash.
Wells Fargo's legal position in the reordering case stands in stark contrast to the I'm-sorry-I'm-trying-to-fix-it public
relations blitz that Sloan has recently undertaken.
""A principle guiding our work to identify potential harm was to err on the side of our customers,"" Sloan said in the
Wednesday letter to employees.
That doesn't seem to include the reordering case.
""Wells Fargo continues to believe that arbitration is a fair, efficient and effective way for a customer to pursue a
legal claim and resolve a legal dispute,"" Kris Dahl, a Wells Fargo spokesman, told The Post.
For many years, the high-to-low posting order was standard in the banking industry, the spokesman said.
""In 2010, Wells Fargo eliminated high-to-low posting order for debit card transactions and moved to chronological
posting-order for these items (the bank also moved to chronological posting-order for checks and ACH
transactions in 2014),"" he added.
It's not unusual for big corporations to try to force customers into arbitration, since it tends to keep legal costs
down.
In fact, it's so popular that Wells Fargo already tried it before in this case - and lost.
In 2011, three years after the reordering case was filed, Wells Fargo asked the trial judge to order the depositors to
pursue their grievances via arbitration.
Judge James Lawrence King denied the request, saying the bank waited too long to make its move.
""Wells Fargo, because of its own strategic litigation decisions and conduct, waived any right it may have had to
compel arbitration as to the plaintiffs,"" the judge wrote.
""Having made its choice, Wells Fargo cannot simply reverse course after failing to achieve through litigation the
sweeping victory it had hoped to achieve,"" he added.
Wells Fargo is now arguing that King's order only applied to the five named plaintiffs - and not to the million or so
other depositors.
Lawyers for the customers, who declined to comment, said in court papers that a ruling in the bank's favor would
be ""unconscionable.""
""To indulge Wells Fargo's belated arbitration motion at this stage would also significantly prejudice the courts and
undermine the integrity of the judicial process,"" the plaintiffs argue in a brief before the Atlanta court."

Bank of America,WELCOME BACKS Ground gainers bully way back to top of draft boards FANTASY INSANITY," Aug 20, 2017",0,"In the fourth of a six-part draft preview series, The Post breaks down running backs. Next week: wide receivers.
America loves a good comeback story: Peyton Manning from neck surgery, John Elway from multiple Super Bowl
losses to repeat champion, Rocky Balboa from round after round of pummeling by his opponent du jour to thrilling
victory. Tiger Woods ... um ... we're still waiting.
In the meantime, let's visit our newest comeback story: fantasy running backs. For years, the fantasy industry has
tried to minimize the dominance of the running back - either through PPR or by way of additional wide receiver
spots on the roster. The NFL has cooperated, with rule changes that have made the game more pass-oriented over
the past decade.
The RB outlook looked most grim after a monumental disaster among top fantasy picks in 2015, which led to many
adopting the ""zero-RB theory"" last season. And then the RBs bit back.
The list of RBs who outperformed their draft position is long: David Johnson, Ezekiel Elliott, Le'Veon Bell, Jay Ajayi,
DeMarco Murray, Jordan Howard, Melvin Gordon ... to name the most impactful.
Now that RBs are back, though, be careful not to be too reactionary and overvalue them. There is a collection at the
top that can be considered trustworthy: primarily those above along with LeSean McCoy and Devonta Freeman.
After that? Well, that is when those pesky questions arise.
When drafting RBs, look for opportunity and upside - and youth, which is why you will see so many rookies
mentioned here. We would rather roll the dice that rookie Dalvin Cook earns the starting job in Minnesota (which he
seems to be doing) than gamble that Marshawn Lynch will recapture his form of two years ago - after a year off,
having struggled last we saw him, now on a new team. Too many questions.
There are values in the early middle rounds in PPR formats. Danny Woodhead is a PPR monster, but a health risk.
But we would rather have him in the fifth than Lamar Miller in the second or third. We like Joe Mixon's chances of
overtaking run-of-the-mill Jeremy Hill and scatback Giovani Bernard in Cincinnati. We don't like old man Frank Gore
behind what has been a poor Colts offensive line, and now possibly without quarterback Andrew Luck.
We also avoid committee backfields. Mark Ingram and Adrian Peterson likely will be a coin flip from week to week,
neither worthy of a starting fantasy spot unless the other gets hurt. Stay away. Similarly, the masses love Panthers
rookie Christian McCaffrey, but Jonathan Stewart still will get significant carries, and those at the goal line that
don't go to him likely will go to QB Cam Newton.
Many analysts are assuming Mike Gillislee will step into the LeGarrette Blount goal-line role in New England. But the Patriots have a history of committees, covering virtually every year between Corey Dillon (2004-2006 with
Patriots) and last season. Do you really trust a one-year anomaly? Or is a cacophony of Gillislee, Rex Burkhead,
James White and Dion Lewis more likely, rendering all of them unstartable?
Play it safe early, leaning on opportunity and recent performance. Later, venture more into upside. Like Kareem
Hunt, who need only supplant Spencer Ware to get significant carries with the Chiefs. And we all know, Spencer
Ware is the William Fichtner of RBs - a character actor who you've seen in good movies, but was never the reason
you liked the movie.
The Redskins' Robert Kelley is this year's less-touted version of Jeremy Langford - holding a spot awaiting
replacement. Samaje Perine might not be this year's Jordan Howard, but the situation is similar.
The Saints' backfield is a minefield, but at least you can bank on rookie Alvin Kamara getting the third-down snaps,
and in PPR, that is useful. Once Kenneth Dixon went down, Terrance West became the Ravens' uncontested
primary back. Sure, he is just a slightly better version of Christine Michael, but the volume makes him a bargain
late.
We have our eye on PPR specialists like Theo Riddick and Charles Sims. C.J. Prosise is even better, because he
can carry a larger load than just third-down back, if he can stay healthy. Eddie Lacy and Thomas Rawls aren't
untouchable in the starting spot, meaning Prosise could get action outside of a specialist role.
In deeper leagues, look at Joe Williams, playing behind brittle Carlos Hyde in San Francisco, D'Onta Foreman
behind underwhelming Texans starter Lamar Miller, Marlon Mack behind the aging Gore in Indianapolis.
But whatever you do, make sure to celebrate the Great American RB Comeback."
Bank of America,"'Cartel' made threats, bled retirees: suit"," Aug 18, 2017",1,"Pensions representing more than 386,000 public workers across the country sued six banks on Thursday, claiming

Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and others formed a ""cartel"" in order to keep their dominant positions
in the securities lending industry, according to a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court.
The suit, which also names Bank of America, UBS and Credit Suisse, claims the banks make up about 70 percent
of the total market.
When competitors threatened to undercut the banks by up to 60 percent, the ""cartel"" made threats, the suit claims.
""This sounds great, but who's going to start your car in the morning?"" one unnamed banker at a meeting asked a

""This lawsuit is important for institutional investors and pension funds in particular who rely on the income from
securities lending to support retirees and other hardworking Americans,"" Michael Eisenkraft, a partner at Cohen
Milstein, the firm representing the pension funds, told The Post.

agreed-upon price. The practice can be lucrative to public pensions, which make up about a third of all securities lenders in the US,

Bank of America,Wall St. should sweat the undramatic stuff," Aug 15, 2017",0,"Recently, I mentioned that North Korea - and fears over the prospect of war - was one of the many problems that
Wall Street would have to face this fall.
Little did I know that the problem would tease itself days later. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 186 point last
Thursday and Friday on precisely those fears.
But the safety of Guam - no offense to its 163,000 residents - isn't the only thing that can rattle US markets. There's
also the Federal Reserve and the economy.
The economy is listless. It has been for a decade.
Growth in the first half of 2017 was at a rate of slightly less than 2 percent a year. In fact, the economy is doing so
poorly that the Federal Reserve had to back off its plan - as I thought it would - to raise interest rates a number of
times this year.
Job growth has been picking up. But there hasn't been a comparable rise in disposable income, so either the jobs
numbers or the income figures - or both - are wrong, or the types of jobs being created are substandard and lowpaying.
That's the dicey economic environment in which the Fed is operating. But the central bank's job is even a bit
tougher than that - it is going through what is called the ""normalization of the Fed's balance sheet.""
That's easy to explain but difficult for the Fed to execute.
In essence, it means that the Fed needs to get rid of the bonds that are on its books from quantitative easing, or
QE. First, there's a possibility that the Fed will botch this operation and create inflation fears that will drive up
interest rates.
But even if the unwinding itself comes off without a hitch, there's a concern that the reversal of QE - which was
designed to put liquidity into the economy - will end up being quantitative tightening (QT), a phrase that I think I
just made up.
If QE helped the economy grow (and it did, but only a little), then might QT cause an already listless economy to
grow even less?
And if economic growth falters some more, what does that mean to a stock market that seems to be taking all the
problems today very lightly?

It's a great day for bootleggers, crooks and terrorism financiers.
New York City government officials have raised the price of cigarettes in a naive belief that it will reduce smoking.
What it will really do is make it even more profitable to bootleg cigarettes from states where smokes are cheaper.
Those profits go into the pockets of both ordinary bad guys and those who fund radical causes overseas that aim
to hurt Americans.
In case you didn't hear, Mayor de Blasio and the City Council last week raised the minimum price of a pack of
cigarettes to $13 from $10.50. A carton of cigarettes will now cost $130.
Bootleggers already make a bundle by bringing cheap, low-taxed cigarettes in from states like Virginia and North
Carolina. But with the new price, they won't have to drive as far. Bootlegging from Pennsylvania, where a carton
goes for around $70, will become more attractive.
""The mayor is insane,"" says one of my spies on the street. ""He's making bad people rich.""
But isn't that what America is all about?
There is a method to the mayor's madness and it's political. If fewer NY-taxed cigarettes are sold, de Blasio can
claim that smoking is dropping, even if smokers are really only shifting to bootlegged cigarettes.

Oil companies keep trying, but they can't seem to enforce production quotas.

I don't believe any of that. But I'm open- minded, so I asked our family dogs, Daisy and Bailey, about this and they
were pretty pissed.
""How can this guy really know what we are feeling?"" said Bailey, a rescue dog who's mostly beagle. ""Walk a mile in
our paws before you pretend to know our feelings.""
Daisy, a fancy King Charles Spaniel, was moody and demanded a treat before she'd explain her emotions.
She started to cry when I wouldn't give in."
Bank of America,'GOT' NUMBERS Cowell: 'Talent' driving 'America's' Season 12 resurgence," Aug 14, 2017",0,"""AMERICA'S GOT TALENT""
8 p.m. Tuesday on NBC
HALFWAY through its 12th season, ""America's Got Talent"" is doing something extremely rare for a veteran show
(regardless of genre).
It's actually gaining viewers.
The NBC series, which premiered back in 2006 (with host Regis Philbin), is averaging 13 million viewers since its
May 30 season premiere as it heads into its live shows (Tuesday night at 8). It also tops all summer reality shows
in both total viewers and adults 18-49.
[Those total viewership numbers rise to 15.2 million and 16 million vis-a-vis Live+3 and Live+7 data, respectively -
the latter a new series record.] Meanwhile, ""AGT"" has racked up over 1.8 billion social media views this season
(Facebook, Twitter, YouTube), triggered by Season 12's first ""Golden Buzzer"" contestant, 12-yearold singing
ventriloquist Darci Lynne Farmer. She snared 274 million views on Facebook, breaking Grace Vanderwaal's ""AGT""
record from last season (134 million Facebook views) in just 22 hours.
""I have to be slightly careful here,"" says ""AGT"" creator/judge Simon Cowell, whose ""Golden Buzzer"" pick, deaf singer
Mandy Harvey, has 183 million views on social media.
""If what I read is true, there could be over 10 either music or variety talent shows on the market. So why is ['AGT']
successful? I haven't got a clue. It's all luck.
""The audience trusts the show and it doesn't rely on gimmicks, which is also important,"" says Cowell, who joined as
a judge last season after Howard Stern's departure. ""I've read about a lot of shows, and they all seem to be based
around, 'It's standing in a line! It's standing on your head! The lights go off when you sing!' My feeling, if I'm being
honest, is that a talent show works when you have talent, and there's only so much you could and should do.
"" 'Got Talent' is a fairly straightforward format; the original number [of contestants] is reduced to around 8 and then
we end up with one. I think if I wrote that down on paper as a format now, and walked into a network and 'AGT'
didn't exist, they'd be going, 'Where's the trapdoor the contestants are gonna fall through when they can't sing?' ""
Cowell says he had one big concern coming into this season - the departure of longtime host Nick Cannon, who
was replaced by Tyra Banks.
""I was worried after Nick [Cannon] left because he was an incredible host, and then Tyra comes in and had a real
impact. She gets the show, which is important. And we've kept [most of] the panel over the years which is really
important,"" he says, alluding to Howie Mandel, Mel B and Heidi Klum.
""It would've been really easy to tear up the panel a couple of years ago because that's what people do ... but the
chemistry works and they all love the show and love the contestants.
""I watch [my fellow judges] out the corner of my eye when we're filming to see how focused people really are and
how much they genuinely care about the contestants - and they do [care]. And, again, that makes a difference."""
Bank of America,New melody for iHeart Creditor easing a bit: source," Aug 11, 2017",1,"The biggest creditor of iHeartMedia is close to blinking in its nearly six-month stare-down with America's largest
owner of radio stations, The Post has learned.
Mutual fund Franklin Resources is working with investment bank PJT Partners on a restructuring plan that could
save iHeart from bankruptcy - although it may ask for more cash guarantees and possibly a controlling equity
stake in return, a source close to the situation said.
Franklin is preparing a proposal to present to fellow creditors and iHeart - formerly known as Clear Channel - as
early as next week, a source close to the situation said. Franklin, which owns $2.3 billion of iHeart's $20 billion in debt, has until now taken the hard stance that it could get
a better recovery in bankruptcy than in an out-of-court restructuring, sources said.
But Franklin adviser PJT Partners has recommended not pushing iHeart into bankruptcy, which would likely result
in a sale of the most profitable of its 855 stations, which include New York City's Z100 and 103.5 KTU, the source
said.
In addition to keeping iHeart's best stations, Franklin's restructuring plan also would likely leave in place iHeart
chairman and Chief Executive Bob Pittman, the former MTV honcho who is generally liked by creditors, the source
said.
In exchange, however, sources said Franklin may ask for creditors to get a majority stake in the business. Also, it
might ask iHeart to issue new debt, perhaps as much as $1 billion, that would need to be paid first before equity
holders could take any distributions or dividends, the source said.
There remains a possibility that if Franklin's ask is too stiff, iHeart will simply reject the offer and go bankrupt.
Still, if it cuts a truce with iHeart's private equity owners Bain Capital and THL Partners, Franklin would be taking a
softer approach than David Tepper's Appaloosa Management, which stuck to its demands when battling Apollo
Global Management's Caesars Entertainment last year.
On Thursday, iHeart said it priced a $150 million bond offering that pays 8.75 percent interest so it can stay current
with debt payments over the next several months.
""I don't think iHeart would be raising these bonds unless they thought they were going to reach a restructuring
deal,"" the source said.
Last month, several lenders to iHeart split from Franklin and came close to reaching a new restructuring plan with
iHeart. However, the creditors, led by Symphony Asset Management, will not sign the deal unless Franklin
ultimately agrees to terms, sources said.
Franklin is not yet in discussions with the Symphony group and likely will offer an alternative restructuring, the
source said.
Franklin declined to comment, and PJT did not return calls."
Bank of America,"STREET CRED From Gowanus to Astoria to Manhattan's Far West Side, developers embrace graffiti art to lure cool-conscious residents Tag team"," Aug 10, 2017",0,"MOMO - a New Orleans-based artist whose murals have adorned residential and commercial facades around
America and Europe - spent last week in Manhattan completing his latest commission.
But this work is inside, at the 864-unit Mercedes House rental in Hell's Kitchen. It begins on a wall behind the front
desk, curls around a corner and over a mail room, and ends near an elevator bank. Some 150 feet in width, the eyecatching
piece shows waves of primary colors that blend into pastels.
""The mural is a nice change of pace to [residents'] ... routines,"" says Lisa Kim, cultural affairs director of Two Trees
Management, which developed Mercedes House.
Instead of walking past sterile walls, a creative display guides tenants home. ""That's the beauty of art in public
places."" Mercedes House is just one NYC development where street art is being deployed to attract a cool crowd.
In Brooklyn, for instance, the 270-unit 363 Bond St. rental in Gowanus brought in LA-based artist Tristan Eaton.
There, he's embellished a poolside wall and water tower with a massive mural of women's faces and the word
""Brooklyn"" spelled out in groovy cursive letters.
While far more conspicuous than Momo's Mercedes House mural, the Gowanus piece has a similar modus
operandi - to quickly anchor the project within the minds of tenants and visitors.
The art's impact is palpable. ""It's a thrill to see things function immediately,"" Momo explains of his latest asterpiece, which is garnering stares of admiration from Mercedes House's West Side residents.
Forms of street art - like murals on building exteriors, or hastily drawn tags - were once considered eyesores or
vandalism, often official crimes that damaged properties and lowered their values.
But as these techniques have evolved into gallery-worthy collectibles, they've been embraced by a number of highend
NYC real estate bigwigs. Whether their works are inside or outside of new buildings, developers increasingly
enlist artists to help their properties stand out. More than a marketing strategy, these moves help honor
neighborhoods' creative flair and improve their streetscapes.
""Instead of a building that whitewashed the area, we thought it'd be a cool idea to incorporate art into the project,""
says Brett Harris of AKI Development, which built the 28-unit Graffiti House rental in Astoria.
Completed in December and now fully leased, this residence rose within the Welling Court Mural Project, a 2009-
debuted initiative for urban beautification. The area now boasts over 100 murals, and the developers knew they
wanted to contribute ever since Graffiti House's inception. ""We thought it would be a great way to give back to the
community,"" Harris adds.
The result: a gallery. Graffiti House includes multichromatic murals in the elevator shaft, visible from the elevator
itself - with works by creatives including street artist Daze, whose indoor pieces have appeared in international
galleries. On the south facade, there's a seven-story display by street artist Rubin 415, whose work has also been
displayed abroad. Harris says Graffiti House, where apartments went for about $2,700/month, leased out in under
three months, attributing the velocity in large part to its emphasis on art.
""Coming home from work, it's so inspiring,"" says Mayara Nadel, a sommelier at Le Bernardin, who lives in a onebedroom
with husband Adam, a chef at Upland. Her favorite mural inside is a polka-dot work, seen from the
elevator shaft, done by Caleb Neelon. What really drew her, though, was a technicolor Welling Court piece visible
from her balcony that spells out ""everything that's important is invisible"" - a quote she loves. Adds Nadel, ""It fosters
creativity. It's mentally invigorating."" Preserving local fabric is also part of the mission at the Forge, a forthcoming
272-unit rental in Long Island City where studios will start around $2,300. During a 2011 visit to the site, codeveloper
David Brause recounts seeing a 20-foot retaining wall covered in graffiti - and in the middle of it, a
""beautifully vibrant"" image of a rooster, which couldn't be removed in a single piece during construction. ""That
rooster encapsulated the artistic energy that is in [Long Island City],"" Brause says. When the building debuts, a
digital print of it will grace the twostory lobby.
The Forge also collaborated with downtown gallery Uprise Art to have Rubin 415 deck out an 80-foot concrete
breezeway with a mural inspired by the neighborhood's industrial past. It should be finished by September.
""Many New Yorkers love art, but do not regularly seek out art or visit galleries,"" says Tze Chun, the founder of
Uprise Art. ""This is a way for people to learn about local artists and interact with their work on a daily basis."" What
these installations all share is a core objective:
to set their homes apart from the crowd amid the cutthroat competition to lure house hunters inside.
""When you're spending money to buy a place, it should have those special details,"" says Gretchen Gatzke, a
Corcoran agent who's part of the sales team for 1257 DeKalb Ave. - a new four-unit condo in street art-heavy
Bushwick. One unit there remains, asking $999,000.
The team enlisted the help of artists Cassandra Holden and Christopher Moore to create 4-by-3-foot murals
alongside stairwell landings that show a variety of Brooklyn sights, including a street scene of Dumbo.
""Street art is desired by people - they want a piece of that in their interiors,"" says Moore. Meanwhile, says Holden:
""It made the building a little more special [to buyers]."" It also doesn't hurt to use art to spice up boring hallways.
That's why the Dermot Company held the ""Hallway Hijack"" last year at its 326unit 66 Rockwell Place rental, where
apartments start at $2,500 in net-effective rent.
Nineteen artists decorated 18 hallways in a variety of styles, including graffiti, over the course of six months -
simply to give residents something fun to walk past.
That experience inspired Dermot to incorporate street art into its 616-flat Manhattan rental at 21 West End Ave.,
where studios begin at $3,210 in net-effective pricing. There, Uprise Art and iCrave curated eight artworks for the interior spaces, including a mural by Rubin 415 that's
located between the indoor dog run, the children's playroom and the arcade/bar.
""We're trying to create a vibe where our residents are in spaces they like to hang out in when they go out, like
restaurants and bars,"" says Stephen Benjamin, Dermot's president and CEO.
Rubin 415 (real name Tony Sjman, a street artist who hails from Sweden) has been painting apartment-building
murals for five years, mostly around NYC.
He says he approaches each project with fresh inspiration and finds it rewarding to work on site-specific pieces.
""It's great to be able to take in the vibe of a development and to create something that complements the building,""
he says.
However, the incorporation of art inside a new development isn't always so celebrated.
5Pointz, the Long Island City graffiti mecca that was demolished to make way for the construction of two rental
towers also named 5Pointz, will soon see a new batch of street art, as its developers have long maintained. When
completed next November, works will grace the exteriors and interior common lounge spaces.
""I love street art, so I'm bringing it back,"" says developer Jerry Wolkoff.
But Jonathan Cohen, 5Pointz's longtime curator, says he believes Wolkoff's new incarnation won't retain any of the
site's graffiti-filled charm, which made it world-famous.
""It's not genuine [art] at all,"" adds Cohen, whose street art name is Meres One.
Cohen himself has since moved on to other projects, some residential. He's creating a 15-story mural on the south
facade of 60 Fulton St., a nearly completed 23-story rental near South Street Seaport, to showcase his art.
""When you create art that improves someone's mood for the day, that's what it's all about,"" he says. ""It should be
everywhere."""
Bank of America,AG eyes bam 'slush' money Sessions probing $6B to leftist groups," Aug 6, 2017",1,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions is investigating up to $6 billion in legal settlement money that the Obama
administration steered toward progressive causes and allies in left-wing advocacy groups.
A memo sent to US attorneys on July 28, published Friday by Breitbart News, ordered a review of a decade's worth
of payouts that Congressional Republicans have called a political slush fund.
Former Obama attorneys general Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch regularly arranged for major corporations to make
large ""donations"" to left-leaning groups like UnidosUS - formerly the National Council of La Raza - and
NeighborWorks America during settlement negotiations to end banking, environmental, civil-rights, and other
federal lawsuits.
The groups getting the money were not victims in the cases or parties to the lawsuits, and Republicans say they
had no proper claim to the cash.
That means that all punitive damages awarded in the cases should have gone into the US Treasury, say
Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee who probed the scheme in 2015.
Instead, $3 billion of the multi-billion-dollar 2013 agreements with Citigroup and Bank of America to settle cases
related to mortgage-backed securities went to community-organizing groups.
The $17 billion Bank of America deal gave it ""extra credit"" if it donated $100 million or more to activist groups
approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The list included UnidosUS, which advocates for illegal immigrants; the National Community Reinvestment
Coalition, a left-leaning housing lobbyist group; Operation Hope, which pushes banks to lend to unqualified
mortgage applicants in Los Angeles; and the Mutual Housing Association of New York, a spinoff of the
controversial community-organizing group ACORN.
Volkswagen was forced to spend $2 billion to promote and develop zero-emission vehicles as part of a 2016
settlement.
Third-party donations have been included in federal settlements since the 1970s.
But the Obama administration ramped up the practice as an end-run around the GOP-controlled House, which
slashed federal funding for politically connected ""housing counseling"" groups in 2011.
Sessions ordered a stop to the strategy in June.
""Settlement funds should go first to the victims and then to the American people - not to . . . the political friends of
whoever is in power,"" Sessions said at the time.
The investigation will be the first tally of the cash that ended up in the hands of left-wing special interests - and
signals a new willingness on Sessions' part to scrutinize Obama administration activities.
The attorney general's inaction on that front has angered the president in recent weeks.
""Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails
&DNC server) &Intel leakers!"" Trump tweeted on July 25.
But Sessions, in a Friday press conference, vowed to chase down government leakers - and to pressure reporters
to give up their sources. Breaking a string of public rebukes against his ""beleaguered"" AG, Trump responded in a tweet:
""After many years of LEAKS going on in Washington, it is great to see the A.G. taking action! For National Security,
the tougher the better!"""
Bank of America,BLOW TO BITCOIN Illicit activity hurts currency's future Dear John The Answer Man," Aug 6, 2017",0,"Dear John: I really think you missed the boat on bitcoin.
You assume bitcoin is just money, when in fact it has many other uses. It's here to stay, and will disrupt every
industry, including governance.
Bitcoin ATMs are an easy on/off ramp, since due to regulations in the US it's very hard to get bitcoin today. If you
look at all the companies (including all banks) that are looking into utilizing this technology, I think you may want
to rethink your view.
Santander Bank alone will save $20 billion in internal transfers. E.G.
Dear E.G.: You are referring to a column I wrote about bitcoin being used to launder money from illegal activities.
It just so happens that last week a US jury indicted a Russian man for operating a digital bitcoin exchange that he
allegedly used to launder more than $4 billion for people involved in crimes ranging from computer hacking to drug
trafficking.
The guy's name is Alexander Vinnik, and he was arrested in a small beach-side village in northern Greece. This is all
according to a report by Reuters.
US officials alleged ""Vinnik and his firm received more than $4 billion in bitcoin and did substantial business in the
US without allowing appropriate protocols to protect against money laundering and other crimes.""
So that pretty much confirms what I wrote about the sudden growth of bitcoin ATMs throughout the city.
But let's also look at the illogical stance you are taking. You say that bitcoin is going to ""disrupt every industry, ncluding governance.""
If that were so - if governments were going to be disrupted - why would governments allow bitcoin and other digital
currency to survive? They wouldn't.
Will there someday be a universal currency used by all countries? And will it be digital?
Probably. But that's not going to happen until bitcoin and the others control the illicit activities they are condoning,
and until someone backs these ""currencies"" with something other than the full faith and credit of nothing.
In other words, eventually governments will band together to create and back a digital currency. And it probably
won't be bitcoin.
Dear John: The only way to make going to the doctor affordable is to get rid of the insurance companies, Medicare
and Medicaid.
When I first began working full-time in 1985, I went to a neighborhood doctor, God rest his soul.
For a $20 visit and another $20 for a prescription, he got me well. Follow-ups were free. He gave free samples. He
even made house calls.
In a cash business, doctors would only be able to charge what the patients have in their wallets and pocketbooks.
No greedy middle men. Prices would fall.
God bless and straight ahead. S.H.
Dear S.H.: I remember when I could get an ice cream cone for 25 cents and a decent dinner would cost $20.
But those days are gone.
And so is the Marcus Welby-era that you describe.
Now I'd like to see some real letters on the health care problem.
Landline a lifeline in a blackout
Dear John: You recently wrote about landline telephones and how they have become obsolete.
In an electrical blackout, cell phones and internet phones won't work, But landlines likely will. So they are still an
extra safety net for those who need them.
In one blackout, we were able to keep my widowed mom connected through the landline.
Of course, as time goes on, those with a landline will have fewer people to connect with as more people go to cell
and internet phones only. W.P."
Bank of America,'Off to jail' Bro's boast," Aug 6, 2017",1,"Cocky ""Pharma Bro"" Martin Shkreli drew a weird parallel between jail and 9/11 Saturday, saying living through the
terrorist attacks would prepare him for a stint in the slammer.
""A few months of jail doesn't scare me. I saw 9/11,"" Shkreli, 34, strangely bragged to a Boston Herald reporter while live-streaming on YouTube.
Shkreli was 18 years old at the time of the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.
Shkreli was found guilty Friday of securities and wire fraud and faces up to 20 years behind bars at his sentencing.
Jurors convicted Shkreli on three of eight counts. Shkreli celebrated the outcome, even though it could get him a
lengthy sentence.
""They found out I exaggerated about my business. Bill Gates has done this . . . it doesn't equate to a criminal lie,""
he said during his Saturday live-stream session.
Shkreli spent a good portion of his Saturday streaming session answering phone calls and playing video games.
He became ""the most hated man in America"" for raising the price of life-saving AIDS drug Daraprim more than
5,000 percent, from $13.50 a pill to $750 a pill.
Prosecutors alleged he had carried out an $11 million Ponzi scheme and allegedly boasted his hedge fund was
worth $100 million when it had just $330 in the bank."
Bank of America,"Jury to pharma creep: Later, 'bro'! Shkreli convicted of securities fraud in Brooklyn"," Aug 5, 2017",1,"The ""Pharma Bro"" is now a felon.
Martin Shkreli was convicted Friday of defrauding investors and trying to manipulate his drug company's stock
prices - but he was still arrogant enough to try to take a victory lap.
""All of this was a witch hunt of epic proportions. Maybe they found a few broomsticks,"" the reviled former
Retrophin CEO scoffed outside the Brooklyn federal courthouse, referring to prosecutors. ""We fought back, and we
feel like we've won.""
Back at his Murray Hill home, ""the most hated man in America"" kept up the class act by live-streaming tracks from
what he said was his single-copy $2 million Wu-Tang Clan album for about 10 minutes.
Prosecutors had accused Shkreli, 34, of running an $11 million Ponzi-like scheme, saying he siphoned funds from
Retrophin, his former pharmaceutical firm, to repay investors of his struggling hedge funds, MSMB Capital and
MSMB Healthcare.
After a five-week trial, it took the jury of seven women and five men 4/[2] days to find the so-called Pharma Bro
guilty of three of the eight charges against him.
The five charges for which he was acquitted involved the alleged Ponzi scam.
A juror said there wasn't enough evidence to prove Shkreli intended to harm investors.
""In some of the counts, at least, we couldn't find that he intentionally stole from them and the reasoning was to
hurt them,"" the juror told The New York Times.
Shkreli - whose cringe-worthy antics outside court included blasting prosecutors as a ""junior varsity"" team and
trolling reporters on Twitter - faces up to 20 years in federal prison on each of two counts of securities fraud.
The third count, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, carries up to five years.
But it would be highly unusual for him to receive consecutive sentences - or even the maximum 20-year sentence,
legal observers said.
A sentencing date had not yet been set. Shkreli has vowed to appeal.
In his live stream after court - a usual Friday activity for the creep - Shkreli said he was confident he would dodge
hard time.
""I think I can get probation. There's a chance there's a complete vacation of the charges,"" he told his just under
1,900 followers on YouTube. ""Just a prosecutor trying to get famous. The two prosecutors in this trial, the only
thing they furthered is embarrassing themselves.""
The Brooklyn native also boasted, ""I'm one of the richest New Yorkers there is, and after today's outcome, it's going
to stay that way.""
He jabbered while playing what he claimed was the Wu-Tang Clan album, ""Once Upon a Time in Shaolin,"" in the
background. Shkreli bought the album - of which only one copy was made - at auction in 2015. As part of the purchase deal, he
supposedly isn't allowed to play it commercially for 88 years.
He had live-streamed two tracks after President Trump was elected. It was unclear whether Friday's live stream
might have included those tracks.
Shkreli became ""the most hated man in America"" for hiking up the price of life-saving AIDS drug Daraprim by 5,000
percent.
But his federal trial focused only on his short-lived stint as a hedge-fund manager.
Prosecutors called investors, accountants and former employees to testify against the often distracted, always tieless
Shkreli.
Unexpected peeks into the smirking loudmouth's personal life emerged during the otherwise dry trial, including
suggestions that Shkreli had contemplated sex romps with men.
Steven Richardson, an early investor who became a chairman at Retrophin, testified that Shkreli expressed an
interest in gay sex to get close to him. Richardson, who is gay, said he once invited Shkreli into his bedroom and
sat him on the bed to confront him over his suggestive comments.
Prosecutors portrayed Shkreli as having lied to investors to coax millions of dollars from them, including claiming
he graduated from Columbia University when he really went to Baruch College.
He also allegedly duped investors by boasting that his fund was worth more than $100 million when its bank
account contained a mere $330.
""He presented himself to different investors as different things,"" Assistant US Attorney Alixandra Smith argued.
""He presented what he thought the investors wanted to hear. ""
At times, Shkreli's lawyer, Ben Brafman, had a hard time reining in his blabbermouth client, whom he compared to
""Rain Man"" in opening statements.
After the verdict, he called Shkreli a ""brilliant young man"" but conceded that ""his people skills don't translate well.""
He said Shkreli plans to stay involved in pharmaceuticals and hopes to develop drugs ""for the treatment of rare
diseases.""
He also said Shkreli would work on his ""image problem.""

Bank of America,DONALD GOES 4TH Trump's Dow rally yuge but not nearly the best," Aug 3, 2017",1,"The Trump rally continued its stunning run on Wednesday, clearing the 22,000-point level on the Dow Jones
industrial average - an amazing 20 percent rise since Election Day.
But as strong as the President Trump-fueled bull run has been (the Dow stood at 18,332 points on Nov. 8), it's only the seventh best nine-month run - on a percentage basis - for a president since the popular index was established
in 1896.
A lot of what is keeping the Trump rally from a better place in history is math.
""A 1,000-point move 30 years ago was an impressive change, but now to go from 21,000 to 22,000 is less than 5
percent,"" Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, told The Post.
On a percentage basis, Franklin Delano Roosevelt's nine months from his 1932 election through Aug. 2, 1933, takes
the cake. The Dow popped 53.8 percent over that span.
To be sure, FDR started at a low base. The Dow stood at 64.60 on the day he was elected.
Bill Clinton had the second-best Dow run among postwar presidents. The index rose 34.7 percent from when he
was elected to his second term through the following Aug. 2 - rocketing over the 7,000-point and 8,000-point
plateaus.
On Tuesday, Trump correctly predicted on Twitter that the Dow would soon hit 22,000. Investors are feeling fatter,
but Wall Street pros are not too amazed.
""From Election Day to the first or second week of December, all credit should go to the president-elect - but since
late January, early February, investors seemed to turn their back on the Trump trade,"" Ablin said.
This could be why Trump ranks fourth among postwar presidents.
The president is sandwiched between George H. W. Bush, who oversaw a 24.9 percent pop on 1988 campaign
promises of ""No New Taxes,"" and Trump nemesis Barack Obama - whose second term started with an 18.2 percent
jump.

""toxic,"" reports Liel Leibovitz at Tablet. It does so by reading various databases ""and letting them figure out the
likely patterns."" But in Google's case, ""the machines learned the comments sections of The New York Times, the
Economist and the Guardian."" So the phrase ""Jews control the banks and the media"" was deemed only 10 percent
toxic, while ""Many terrorists are radical Islamists"" was deemed 92 percent toxic. In other words, when the
machines only ""read the Guardian and the Times, they're going to inherit the inherent biases of these publications.""
So they've learned that ""statements about Jews being slaughtered are controversial, addressing radical Islamism
is verboten and casual anti-Semitism is utterly forgivable.""
From the right: Dem IT Scandal Is Not About Bank Fraud In Washington, ""it's never about what they tell you it's about,"" warns Andrew McCarthy at National Review. And ""the
case of Imran Awan, Debbie Wasserman Schultz's mysterious Pakistani IT guy, is not about bank fraud,"" with
which he's been charged after trying to flee the United States for Pakistan via Qatar. Turns out ""Awan and his
family cabal of fraudsters had access for years to the e-mails and other electronic files of members of the House's
Intelligence and Foreign Affairs Committees."" Indeed, ""they were accessing members' computers without their
knowledge, transferring files to remote servers and stealing computer equipment - including hard drives that Awan
&Co. smashed to bits of bytes before making tracks."" Yet Awan remained on Schultz's payroll (after working for
various Democrats since 2004) until his arrest. Says McCarthy: ""This appears to be a real conspiracy, aimed at
undermining American national security.""
Foreign desk: Vladimir Putin's Really Bad Bet
Even if Vladimir Putin did collude with Donald Trump's campaign to steal the election, which Matthew Walther at
The Week remains skeptical of, he's ""probably suffering from a serious case of buyer's remorse right about now.""
The new sanctions voted by Congress ""will be crippling for the Russian economy and hard on many American
businesses."" And the language of the bill puts Moscow ""on the same level as Iran and North Korea as enemies of
the United States rather than curmudgeonly partners."" For all intents and purposes, ""the Cold War is back - and
heating up very quickly."" So if Putin ""planned on eventually getting the United States and its NATO allies off his
back,"" he's probably feeling like he's been ""double-crossed.""
Culture critic: New Series Makes '20s Icons Come Alive
Paul Beston at City Journal writes about ""America in Color,"" a new Smithsonian Channel series that ""chronicles the
nation's history, from the 1920s through the 1960s, via digitally colorized footage."" The effect, he says, ""is
revelatory"" - especially the episode on the 1920s, traditionally seen only in black and white, which makes ""it seem
almost as if these people were still around, as if the events were transpiring in an eternal present, the way they do
in memory (or in dreams)."" It's a reminder that ""people in the past didn't live in the past. They lived in the present,
just like we do, making it up as they went."""
Bank of America,Nazi-treasure hunt $130M in gold eyed on sunken ship," Jul 28, 2017",1,"A World War II-era German cargo ship that sunk in the Atlantic Ocean 77 years ago could hold up to $130 million
worth of Nazi gold - and a team of treasure hunters is awaiting the green light to haul it up.
The lost loot is believed to be deep under the waters near Iceland in a chest inside a merchant vessel called the SS
Minden.
A British salvage company has reportedly requested permission from Icelandic authorities to cut a hole in the ship
in an attempt to retrieve the roughly four tons of gold, which originally came from banks in South America.
The wreckage of the ship was discovered about 120 nautical miles south of Iceland, The Sun newspaper reported.
The ship had sunk in 1939 and remained missing for years.
The UK-based Advanced Marine Services salvage company discovered the chest in the vessel's post room earlier
this year.
The Nazis had been shipping the gold to Germany in an attempt to get it back before the start of World War II.
The Minden reportedly set sail from Brazil on Sept. 6, 1939, just days after the war began. Under orders from Adolf Hitler, the crew was said to have scuttled the ship on Sept. 24 in a bid to protect its
valuable cargo from falling into the hands of the the British Royal Navy.
A spokesman for the Icelandic Environmental Agency told Fox News on Thursday that an application had been
received for the salvage operation, though it could take weeks before a decision is made.
The Advanced Marine Service team wants ultimately to take the chest to Britain, under the claim that its contents
belong to the people who found it.
While the Minden is not technically in Iceland's territorial waters, it does sit in the country's exclusive economic
zone - meaning authorities in that nation can enforce pollution controls and environmental- impact measures so no
one interferes with the wreck.
They can't, however, make claim to any salvage.
The Icelandic officials are reportedly expected to make a decision about the chest's ownership by no later than
next month."
Bank of America,Yellen's opioid remarks smack of hypocrisy," Jul 23, 2017",1,"Fed chief Janet Yellen in congressional testimony recently suggested that the opioid epidemic hitting the Ohio
Valley states and elsewhere could be contributing to the historically low workforce participation rates for men.
While drug use and abuse is a public policy program, the Fed has now dipped its toe into the debate. ""I do think it is related to declining labor force participation among prime-age workers,"" Yellen told senators last
week about the crisis.
However, here is the key idea: ""I don't know if it's causal or if it's a symptom of long-running economic maladies
that have affected these communities and particularly affected workers who have seen their job opportunities
decline,"" Yellen continued.
While the Fed was bailing out the banks with its once-in-a-lifetime QE programs, middle America was running out
of unemployment benefits, on the verge of losing their homes and struggling to stay afloat.
To stave off a further crisis, the Obama administration loosened requirements for workers to go on Social Security
disability. Look at the data about new disability enrollees during the 2009-2011 period.
In 2009, Social Security disability claims jumped 21 percent over the prior year. In 2011, the feds were paying more
than 23 million Americans some type of disability claim. That's about 7 percent of the overall population, and 16
percent of the workforce, according to publicly available data. None of this data take into account workers'
compensation cases.
Of course, you still needed to prove you were injured on the job, and likely had to be put on pain meds for an injury
sustained in a manufacturing job, like most of the positions in the Ohio area.
There are recent stories of doctors in the area prescribing millions of opioid pills over the period in question. This is
what happens when the treatment is discontinued, but the addiction is too strong.
So it seems a bit disingenuous for Yellen &Co. to say if their job-creation policy shortcomings - the low
participation rates of males in the Cleveland Fed's area - may be attributed to opioid addiction of the workforce.
The Fed knows how to administer stimulus to the banks when they get strung out on outrageous lending binges,
but it has a tougher time with the victims of that policy when they need to numb the pain."
Bank of America,iPhone 8 feature: Lots of delay talk," Jul 18, 2017",1,"Delays of Apple's next iPhone model may get longer and more widespread than expected.
Mass production of Apple's new flagship phone, which according to some rumors will be called either the iPhone 8
or the iPhone X, will be delayed to November or possibly even December, the Chinese-language publication
Economic Daily News reported Monday.
Such reports often don't pan out, but there has been more buzz than usual this year about delays of the new
iPhone, whose OLED display has reportedly been costly and difficult to produce.
Last week, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts slashed their forecast for full-year shipments of Apple's iPhone
by 11 million, citing manufacturing hiccups related to new fingerprint features and 3D facial-recognition
technology.
Earlier last month, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said he expects Apple will unveil the OLED iPhone in
September, but that shoppers will face ""severe supply shortages"" during the holidays.
The Chinese media report said ""yield rates"" for the new iPhones - including the lower-priced 7s and the 7s Plus
models - ""have not yet reached levels that warrant mass production"" at key iPhone manufacturers Foxconn and
Pegatron, according to a citation by Digitimes.

Dear John: I'm getting nowhere with Citicorp's Personal Wealth Management.
My elderly mother's revocable trust with Citi Personal Wealth Management closed out earlier this year due to
inactivity during her extended illness.
The bank had originally asked for updated information to reopen it, and she needed to send that by April. When I
called on May 4, the call-taker assured me the paperwork was received the day before and was being processed.
There was no contact thereafter, so I called again at the end of May and was told the paperwork couldn't be
located.
This was very disturbing considering the rampant identity theft nowadays.
So I mailed it again on June 5, with one complete set going via certified mail to the chief executive's office, and the
other to the designated post office box with a cover letter asking for an acknowledgement.
No response from either.
Then I called last Wednesday, and the supervisor said it should only take three to five days to process, and she
foresaw no problem.
I called again today and was told the paperwork was received, but the bank cannot advise until next week why it is
not processed.
My mother is on a fixed income and desperately needs the monthly payments from this account again and needs it
reopened pronto, please! Help! T.R.
Dear T.R.: I don't know what was going on, but Citi handled it quickly after I forwarded your letter to the company.
And apparently the situation has been resolved. Your letter to me said: ""Thank you very much. Mom and I spoke via
phone today with the Citi rep who is finalizing the resolution of reopening Mom's trust fund, with monthly
payments to resume.
""Thanks to your valued intervention, they are now dead serious about resolving this.""
No problem. The Post was happy to help.

look around Connecticut, in Greenwich and particularly in Stamford.
Fairfield County is home to plenty of Fortune 100 companies.
One company, Boardroom, came in the late '80s or early '90s as its founder, Martin Edelstein, foresaw massive

Dear P.F.: OK, you can now collect your check for public relations services from Mr. Edelstein. The company,
incidentally, is now called Bottom Line. You'll have to get that right in the future to be a successful p.r. person.
Look, I agree. Companies have often moved out of New York City because of the inconvenience. My point in the

Bank of America,Bank boss Dimon slams political 'dysfunction' DC is left Chase-tised!," Jul 15, 2017",0,"Take that to the bank!
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon went on an epic rant Friday that sounded more like a stump speech - ripping
Washington bureaucrats for their chronic dysfunction and infuriating inability to get anything done.
""It's almost an embarrassment being an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid s--t
we have to deal with in this country,"" a clearly frustrated Dimon said in response to a question during an earnings
call with analysts.
""Since the Great Recession, which is now eight years old, we've been growing at 1.5 to 2 percent in spite of
stupidity and political gridlock, because the American business sector is powerful and strong,"" he said, banging his
hand on the table for emphasis.
""What I'm saying is it would be much stronger growth had we made intelligent decisions and were there not
gridlock.""
He also painted a dismal portrait of life in America under the slow-growth economy of the past nine years. ""People
wake up in the morning, they want to feed their kids, they want to buy a home, they want to do things. The same
with American businesses,"" he said. ""I'm going to be a broken record until this gets done. We are unable to build
bridges, we're unable to build airports, our inner-city school kids are not graduating.""
He also railed about what he said was government's overregulation of the banking industry, which he argued was
slowing economic growth.
""The counter-factual [relaxation of rules] would have been that a trillion dollars or 2 trillion would have been lent out
had these rules been changed five years ago,"" he said. ""There's a false notion that all this stuff didn't hold back the
economy. Yes, it did.""
Gridlock in DC has not lessened even after the GOP captured the White House and both houses of Congress.
The Republican-controlled Congress and Trump administration have been unable to score any major legislative
victories on health care, tax reform or infrastructure.
Other countries, he said, are doing a far better job.
""I was just in France, I was recently in Argentina, I was in Israel, I was in Ireland. We met with the prime minister of
India and China,"" he said.
""It's amazing to me that every single one of those countries understands that practical policies to promote
business and growth is good for the average citizens of those countries, for jobs and wages, and that somehow
this great American free-enterprise system, we no longer get it.""
One of the main problems, he added, was excessive corporate taxes. ""We've been driving capital earnings
overseas, which is why there's $2 trillion overseas benefiting all these other countries,"" Dimon said.
But despite the diatribe, Dimon said not all hope is lost if Trump and Congress can get their act together.
""I don't buy the argument that we're relegated to this forever. We're not if this administration can make
breakthroughs in taxes and infrastructure, regulatory reform,"" he said.
JAMIE GETS DOWN TO BUSINESS
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon's told shareholders that Beltway politicians need to tackle these six problems
to boost the US economy:
LABOR FORCE:
Participation is too low, having shrunk from 66% to 63% between 2008 and 2016. Washington needs to enact
polices that would boost employment.
EDUCATION: Many high schools and vocational schools do not provide the education students need.
The goal should be to prepare students to be ready for the workforce when they graduate. TAXES: Our corporatetax system is driving capital and brains overseas. US has highest corporate-tax rates among
developed nations, and major tax reform is needed.
INFRASTRUCTURE: In early 1960s, US had best infrastructure in world. The World Economic Forum now ranks us
27 out of 138 countries.
Washington must spend what it takes to rebuild the nation's highways, airports and power grid.
REGULATION: Excessive regulations reduce growth and business formation. Cuts in regulations would free
businesses to prosper.
ECONOMIC GROWTH:
Low job growth, a lack of opportunity for many and declining wages are leaving students and low-wage workers
behind. Politicians must address high health-care costs and Source: Dimon's 2016 letter to shareholders growing

Bank of America,Granny and Clyde 'Bank heist' geezers," Jul 13, 2017",1,"It wasn't just the cradle she was robbing.
A 71-year-old woman and her 60-year-old boyfriend were busted by the FBI this week for committing a string of
bank heists dating back to 2015, authorities said.
Phyllis Jackson and Benjie Richmond were picked up at their home in Brooklyn on Tuesday, shortly after they held
up the Chase branch at Sixth Avenue and West 44th Street, according to Manhattan federal prosecutors.
The Bonnie &Clyde duo is suspected of hitting several banks over the past two years, using the same M.O. each
and every time.
""She [stands] at the teller station as he comes in behind her, pushes a demand note and displays a firearm,"" said
Lt. John Rogan, of the FBI-NYPD Joint Bank Robbery Violent Crimes Task Force. ""It's unassuming,"" he said. ""A male and female entering a bank.""
While prosecutors had enough evidence to charge Jackson with robbing only three banks, they were able to get
Richmond for eight.
Authorities said the couple has made off with more than $10,000 since beginning their spree in 2015. In their latest
heist, they swiped $1,685, the feds said.
The biggest score came in December 2015, when Richmond allegedly held up the Citibank at 395 Ave. of the
Americas and walked away with $3,280.
Jackson joined him in the summer of 2016, with her first caper July 5 at a NorthEast Community Bank on West
23rd Street, the feds said. She walked into the building with Richmond and posed as a customer while he slipped a
note to the teller and flashed a gun, according to authorities.
""Just give me the money. I have a weapon. Don't make noise, no one gets hurt,"" the piece of paper read.
Jackson would allegedly go on to rob two more banks with her younger lover - although authorities are not ruling
out her participation in the other holdups.
""We have two elderly individuals who are committing these crimes,"" Rogan said. ""They are quite spry for their age."""
Bank of America,Street gets the iPhone jitters," Jul 13, 2017",0,"Wall Street's anxiety about iPhone delays is growing.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Wednesday slashed its forecast for full-year shipments of Apple's iPhone by 11
million, citing increasing worries about possible manufacturing hiccups.
In particular, the analysts said there have been issues with new fingerprint-recognition features and 3-D facialrecognition

Bank of America,Bonds get high on June's potent jobs report," Jul 11, 2017",0,"The bond market isn't waiting for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Traders are taking matters into their
own hands.
Friday's excellent (on the surface) jobs report for June sent rates on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to nearly
the highest level of 2017.
In fact, the 10-year rate is now almost a full percentage point higher than it was at this time last year.
Interest rates on that note have risen 75 percent since July 11, 2016.
Friday's jobs report pushed the 10-year rate to 2.39 percent, compared with just 1.43 percent a year ago. On
Monday, the rate slid back a little, to 2.36 percent.
That's the funny thing about the Fed. Most of the time it has to follow the market's lead by raising interest rates
after borrowing costs have already risen.
To give this further perspective, rates on that same note were 2.45 percent in the first week of 2017 and got as
high as 2.53 percent in the middle of January, when there was hope that the economy was going to pick up under
the Trump administration.
Interest rates rise when the economy is looking healthier because investors think there will be more demand for
loans and banks will be able to charge more.
Rates fell a little during the spring months because the nation's economy didn't pick up. In fact, the first-quarter
gross domestic product of the US rose at an abysmal annual rate of 1.4 percent.
There are a lot of other factors that influence interest rates in the markets. The Fed's attitude toward rates -
whether it announces an increase or no change - is just one of them.
There's also the worry about Washington's policies, the chance of tax cuts, the federal debt, our nation's deficit,
how Congress is behaving and the president's attitude toward financial issues. The monthly employment report, which on Friday showed an excellent gain of 222,000 jobs in June and upward
revisions in the prior two months' results, is a strong factor in what happens to interest rates.
Even though the June figure was deeply flawed - pay increases were weak, seasonal adjustments accounted for a
lot of the 222,000 increase and more people quit looking for work - Wall Street typically reacts to whatever is in the
headline.
That's why interest rates climbed on Friday's report.
The stock market also gained Friday, and that's something investors should watch carefully. Higher interest rates
will slow down an economy, especially when it isn't doing well to begin with.
More importantly, higher rates someday will siphon off money that has been going into stocks only because that
has been the only investment generating a respectable return.
While interest rates aren't high enough to do damage yet, keep an eye on them. That could be where the trouble for
investors will likely begin.

There's a saying: ""garbage in, garbage out.""
That means if you put salt instead of sugar in a chocolate cake, don't expect it to taste sweet. And if you base your
economic predictions on misleading raw data, then don't expect your guesses to be right.
Bank of America analysts are the latest to moan about the lack of demand for gasoline during this summer's ""peak
driving season."" They can't understand why demand for gasoline has been weak.
Now that the usual July 4 peak in gasoline use has come and gone - without any pickup in demand - those who've
been saying, ""wait until next week"" have given up waiting for the improvement in gas prices.
I really hate to pat myself on the back (but only because it's hurting my shoulder) but I predicted a couple months
ago that gasoline prices would drop this summer, just like they did last year.
And prices have declined - by a lot.
Do I have some magical power that makes me able to guess these things? If I did, I'd be working on Wall Street.
No, I understand that for years ,Washington data have been misleading people like those who work at Bank of
America into thinking that the US economy, which really isn't doing much of anything, is actually stronger than it
really is.
So when BofA and others use the government's garbage statistics in making their predictions, the resulting guess
turns into garbage.
This has been going on for years, and I doubt Wall Street will ever figure it out. But now you know.

I must have told you a hundred times about the mess at the Census Bureau. And how the agency is having trouble
putting together the policies and procedures for its 2020 decennial census.
This needs to be fixed. Census is an important agency - and if you don't believe me, consider this independent
report.
The George Washington Institute for Public Policy calculates that the 50 states plus the District of Columbia
received $589.7 billion from the 16 largest programs, thanks to the 2010 Census.
Twelve grant-making programs distributed $427.7 billion, or 68.5 percent of all federal grants.
Four programs that provided direct payments to individuals distributed $162 billion.
This is the way it works.
Those 16 programs use ""22 datasets derived from the last census.""
As my regular readers can attest, I've been a longtime critic of Census, whose head, John Thompson, was recently
sent packing. Oh, and by the way, the 2020 Census will be used to determine how many House members each
state gets to elect - until 2030."

Bank of America,It's simple: Put job cart behind reform horse," Jul 6, 2017",1,"Donald Trump promised to create jobs for Americans if he became president. Well, he did (become president) but
he hasn't (created many jobs).
On Friday we'll see if the last three months of subpar job growth was an unfortunate aberration or if the Trump

As it stands after revisions, May's employment increase was 138,000 jobs, April's gain was 174,000, and March's

The ""experts"" expect to see a modest addition of 170,000 June jobs when the monthly report comes out at 8:30
a.m. Friday. The unemployment rate is expected to stay put at 4.3 percent.
President Trump is already falling into the trap that everyone in the Oval Office before him has been caught in. He's
celebrating his administration's job creation even though the numbers don't support any kind of jubilation.
If the president were smart, he'd use the slow economic growth to push through his tax reform and health care
legislation. Without reform, he should say, Americans are going to have to get used to slow job growth.
To be perfectly honest, monthly and quarterly economic numbers are really meaningless. Government economists
will tell you that all economic data produced by Washington is meant to be viewed over longer periods of time.
Each month's report contains lots of statistical noise - assumptions and revisions that will make the data jumpy.
But when reviewed over a long period of time, the data is a whole lot more credible.
Unfortunately for the government economists, Wall Street and the media are impatient. So Friday's number will
generate an immediate reaction.
The June jobs report, like all others, will contain a lot of statistical noise.
One loud addition to the June number will be the guesstimate of the number of jobs created by newly ""born""
companies that the Labor Department surveys miss.
That model has been adding more than 200,000 jobs a month to the number that the Labor Department reports.
June's guesstimate will be half that amount, so the job market won't be getting much help from any newbie companies
The problem with seasonal adjustments is that they reverse. Positive adjustments now must be counteracted with
negative adjustments later. In other words, what helped the jobs report in the spring will eventually hurt it.
We will soon know whether that hurt begins with Friday's number.
Federal Reserve members have been expressing concern that the stock market is acting in an irrational manner.
This is the same concern Alan Greenspan had when he was in the middle of his disastrous leadership of the Fed
back in the late 1990s.
Irrational exuberance, Greenspan called it. And we all learned our lesson when stock prices collapsed during the
dot-com bubble. Even worse, Wall Street's misbehavior and miscalculations by the Fed led to all the problems in
2007 and 2008.
So what can the Fed do now to get its power back? What can Fed boss Janet Yellen do to make Wall Street
behave?
It hasn't happened since Paul Volcker was Fed chairman in the 1980s, but a surprise, between-meeting rate hike
would do the trick. As I've been saying, the Fed has little reason to raise rates in the first place, because the
economy is still weak.
But it needs rates higher so they can be lowered when the economy tanks again. If the Fed happens to get even a
short period of reasonable economic growth, an unexpected rate hike would shock Wall Street back into
obedience.
I'm not saying this is going to happen. I'm just saying that it has happened before.
My July 4 column was about America's 241-year aversion to paying taxes and how tax reform - if done wrong -
might incite people to act like their rebellious forefathers.
Well, a new Gallup survey shows significant support (no surprise here) for middle class tax cuts: 61 percent agreed
with the idea, 26 percent disagreed, and the rest couldn't be awakened to give an opinion.
But people weren't so much in favor of a cut in corporate taxes. Another non-surprise.
Thirty-eight percent reacted positively and 43 percent negatively. The rest probably hung up because it was the
thousandth unsolicited call they got that week.
There was one surprise. Only 51 percent thought their own taxes were ""too high."" That was down from 57 percent
in 2016 and much lower than the 63 percent who said they paid too much tax in 1986 when the Tax Reform Act
was passed.
Gallup didn't call me (OK, maybe I hung up) but unless Washington can persuade the financial markets that any tax
reform isn't going to further break the country's already broken bank, then it ain't gettin' done - not this year and not
until the economy is stronger."

Bank of America,"Rich pol, poor pol in Congress NY delegation's wealth divide"," Jul 2, 2017",1,"Forget party divides - New York's congressional delegation is split among the rich and poor.
Some members are multimillionaires with investment properties and others are burdened with thousands of
dollars in credit-card debt and multiple mortgages.
The pols are required in annual reports to disclose their assets, investments, outside income from book deals and
other ventures, and travel. The assets are listed in ranges.
A Post review of new public disclosures for 2016 found:
n Upper East Side Rep. Carolyn Maloney reported assets that ranged from $11.3 million to $47.3 million.
The Democrat owns investment homes in Virginia, a 25 percent interest in a rental property on the island of
Jamaica and holds a bundle of municipal bonds. She was ranked the 22nd wealthiest member of Congress in
2014, according to the Web site Open Secrets.
She traveled on congressional trips to Qatar and Cyprus, and to Liberia, Nigeria and other African nations.
n Assets held by Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey of Westchester and her husband ranged from $11 million to $44
million. The couple kept between $1 million and $5 million in their checking account. Lowey was ranked the 17th
wealthiest member of Congress in 2014.
n Rep. Adriano Espaillat, the former state assemblyman from Harlem who replaced retired Rep. Charles Rangel in
January, appeared to be one of the wealthier members of Congress, according to his initial disclosure report, where
the Democrat reported having a checking balance of between $5 million and $25 million.
But Espaillat filed an amended disclosure last week, adjusting the balance in the Banco Popular account to
between $1,001 and $15,000.
n Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand reported bank balances of up to $550,000, while senior Dem Sen. Charles
Schumer had up to $460,000 in his accounts.
n Rep. Lee Zeldin, a Republican who represents the eastern end of Long Island, owns a home worth up to $250,000
in Sierra Vista, Ariz. He received up to $15,000 in rental income from the property last year.
Zeldin purchased the house while he was on active duty in the Army and stationed at nearby Fort Huachuca, his
spokeswoman said. n Rep. Daniel Donovan, a Republican representing Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn, owns investment properties
much closer to home. He has a Staten Island house worth up to $1 million, from which he received up to $50,000 in
rental income. He also has a quarter-interest in another property.
n Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D-Brooklyn) owns a home in Vieques, PR, worth up to $1 million. She received rental
income of up to $50,000 from it. She also reported credit-card debt between $10,000 and $15,000.
n Rep. Eliot Engel (D-Bronx) reported between $10,000 and $15,000 in Visa credit-card debt, and Rep. Kathleen Rice
(D-LI) said she owed between $50,000 and $100,000 to America Express.
n Gregory Meeks filed his disclosure by the May 15 deadline for the first time since 2013. The Queens Democrat
listed three mortgages on his St. Albans home.
Ranked among the poorer members of Congress, Meeks did not list any bank accounts, investments or assets.
n Several pols are double dipping and collecting state pensions while cashing their federal paychecks, including
Reps. Jose Serrano (D-Bronx) and Jerrold Nadler (D-Manhattan), who are both former members of the state

Bank of America,Bailout bonanza Buffett's BofA rescue nets him a sweet $12B," Jul 1, 2017",1,"Warren Buffet on Friday proved again he is the savviest investor in the US.
The billionaire's Berkshire Hathaway is about to record a $12 billion profit from bailing out Bank of America in 2011
- more than doubling his investment.
The Buffett bailout, which came at a time when BofA was facing questions about its soundness, is among the
shrewdest for the billionaire investor.
""He got a sweetheart deal,"" Dick Bove, analyst at Rafferty Capital, told The Post.
""It's not because he did some phenomenal analysis,"" Bove said. ""He figured, 'I'm getting this stuff at way below
market, and this company is not going to die, so how can I make money?'""
Here's how the Oracle of Omaha did it:
In 2011, Wall Street thought that Bank of America was in trouble. Just three years after the financial crisis, the
bank's stock had fallen 30 percent during the first three weeks of August on concerns it didn't have enough capital.
Buffett, seeing a deal, swooped in and brokered a deal with the bank: $5 billion in preferred shares that paid a 6
percent dividend - or $300 million a year.
But that wasn't all.
The shares came with warrants for 700 million shares of the company at about $7.14 a share, about where the
stock was trading at that time.
And to show there was a bit of risk involved, BofA shares dipped to below $6 a share later that year.
Fast-forward to Thursday, when BofA shares closed at $24.32 - more than three times the value of Buffett's
warrants.
The investor will take his $5 billion in preferred shares and exercise those 6-year-old warrants at $7.19 and he'll
have $17 billion in new BofA stock.
Back out the $5 billion he invested in August 2011, and you're left with a $12 billion profit - and that doesn't even
count the $1.8 billion in interest payments the bank made to Buffett over the years on the preferred shares.
While the Oracle of Omaha is known for his tough deals, this didn't seem to be his plan all along.
In fact, he indicated that he wouldn't convert those warrants into equity until 2021, when they expired.
But in the meantime, he would sit back and collect $300 million a year.
So what changed?
On Wednesday, after Bank of America passed its latest stress test, the Federal Reserve gave it the all-clear to hike
its dividend by 60 percent, to 48 cents a share.
That was such a big increase that Buffett would be losing out on an another $36 million a year if he didn't convert -
the newly sweetened dividends on 700,000 shares equal $336 million a year.
All in all, Buffett, now 86, has made 175 percent on his investment, if you factor in dividends, and has no plans to
sell any time soon.
If average investors had made a bet on the S&P 500 during that same period, they would have made a tidy 80
percent profit.
Not bad. But not Buffett, either."
Bank of America,Oracle casts big shadow in banking world," Jul 1, 2017",0,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is now the largest single shareholder of Bank of America - but that's not the
only piece of Wall Street he owns.
Buffett, 86, is also the biggest shareholder of Wells Fargo, with a little under 10 percent of the San Francisco bank,
and US Bancorp, a Minneapolis bank that's among the largest in the country.
In addition to those holdings, he's also the seventh-biggest owner of Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon
- and the eighth-largest shareholder of M&T Bank, a Buffalo bank with $16.5 billion in assets.
While he has a powerful voice in the boardrooms of a handful of the world's biggest banks, none of his stakes are
more than 10 percent - the threshold where additional regulation by the Federal Reserve kicks in.
Buffett, who tends to get listened to when he speaks, has been more of a passive investor in banks, but can have a
major sway in how banks operate, said Dick Bove, analyst at Rafferty Capital Markets.
""Based upon his public statements, he's a strong believer in what the bank regulators believe, which is that banks
should stick to banking,"" he said.
While Buffett was instrumental in removing John Stumf as CEO of Wells Fargo in the wake of the fake accounts
scandal, he probably won't be piping up too much any time soon.
""Why would you worry more about Warren Buffett than some mutual fund complex?"" one prominent banking lawyer
told The Post."
Bank of America,"Power failure Traffic gains slow, causing an outlet store ..."," Jun 30, 2017",0,"Et tu, outlet malls?
After years of being seemingly insulated from the ills affecting department stores, the country's 200-plus outlet
malls are starting to show signs of strain.
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, which owns 43 centers in 22 states and is the largest publicly traded pure-play
outlet operator in the US, is throwing off some warning signs, experts tell The Post.
The Greensboro, NC, company, seen as a bellwether for the sector, is not planning any outlet openings for 2018,
one industry watcher said - noting it was the first time in recent memory that no new opening has occurred.
Plus, Tanger isn't attracting the shoppers that it was used to, according to RS Metrics, a satellite data company.
Tanger used to lead all outlet centers in drawing consumers but now, like all centers, is seeing only a modest
increase in shoppers, according to RS Metrics, which uses satellite to monitor cars in scores of shopping centers.
""They are no longer an outperforming the sector,"" said Mike Gantcher, managing director of RS Metrics.
At investment bank Boenning &Scattergood, analyst Floris van Dijkum predicts that base rentals will rise 3.5
percent next year, down from a 6.6 percent bump in 2016.
Tanger shares are down 31 percent over the past 12 months, and the company earlier this year said profits for
2017 would be lower than expected.
Bank of America analyst Craig Schmidt recently downgraded Tanger to underperform from neutral.
Many of the same shoppers who filled parking lots at these far-from-urban-center outlets now see just as strong a
value at off-pricers like T.J.Maxx or Nordstrom Rack, some said.
Investors have also expressed concerns about the company's reliance on apparel stores - among the worst hit by
the so-called retail apocalypse - which make up 58 percent of the company's rent roll, according to van Dijkum.
Other outlet center operators, like Simon Properties - owner of the largest outlet center in the country, Woodbury
Common Premium Outlets - and Macerich Properties and GGP have also come under pressure.
The warning signs in the outlet industry ""are going to show up in Tanger first,"" said real estate lawyer Jeff Green, of
Jeff Green Partners.
There could be a new threat to outlet centers coming down the pike: new centers opening up smack dab within the
borders of big cities like New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia.
Macerich is developing several urban outlet centers, including a $500 million makeover of the former Gallery Mall
into the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia at Market East.
In the Big Apple, an enormous project - Empire Outlets, billed as the city's first outlet center - is expected to open
next year on Staten Island's waterfront.
""The outlets are coming closer to, and into, cities - and that's a two-edged sword for retail,"" said Customer Growth
Partners President Craig Johnson. ""You have the risk of cannibalization of the full-price retailers.""
Tanger declined to comment."
Bank of America,FAST TAKES," Jun 29, 2017",1,"From the right: Let Consumers Repeal ObamaCare
Conservative critics are right that the Senate GOP replacement bill ""doesn't go nearly far enough to lower health
insurance premiums,"" says Robert L. Pollock at Real Clear Politics. So he suggests adding ""simple language"" to
create ""an Optional Federal Charter for health insurance regulation."" Health care remains so expensive because
""there are so many legally mandated benefits that must be covered."" Under the OFC, ""there would be no coverage
mandates and no rules governing the shape of policies such as limits on deductibles and co-pays. Insurers could
still be required to cover those with pre-existing conditions and subsidies could still be offered to help those who
need them."" Consumers ""would simply be offered a new choice: purchase a state-regulated policy or a federally
regulated policy."" This would also fix the problem of ""ObamaCare markets with only one or no insurance options.""
Foreign desk: Obama Lost on Russia Way Before Election
An unnamed top Obama administration official told The Washington Post ""we choked"" on handling reports of
Russian election meddling. But Eli Lake at Bloomberg says the admission ""isn't entirely fair."" Besides, the bigger
question is why Vladimir Putin ""thought he could get away with this interference in the first place."" The reason, he
suggests, is that Barack Obama ""spent the first six years of his presidency turning a blind eye to Russian
aggression"" as he ""pursued a policy of 'reset.' "" Throughout his presidency, Obama ""failed to respond to Russian
cheating on arms-control agreements,"" afraid of being seen as ""a throwback to the Cold War."" Having ""probed
American resolve for years"" and found it lacking, ""it's easy to understand why Putin would believe he had a free
shot.""
Mideast watch: Abbas Fears He's Losing His State
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas ""is expressing concern"" that he hasn't heard President Trump or
any of his emissaries ""utter the words 'Palestinian state,' "" reports Yoni Ben-Menachem at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. That's because Abbas still insists that the only basis for the ""serious peace deal"" Trump wants is a
Palestinian state along the 1967 lines. For him, ""statehood and east Jerusalem are Palestinian 'red lines' that he is
unwilling and unable to surrender,"" so Abbas ""knows he has a serious problem."" He reportedly fears Trump will
offer ""expanded autonomy in the West Bank gift-wrapped with a presidential regime, government, parliament and
embassies around the world,"" but with Israel controlling security. He now regrets having rejected the sweeping
deal then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert offered in 2008.
Conservative take: Why US Schools Continue To Fail
Most industries improve each year - but not education, complains John Stossel at Fox News, who recommends a
new PBS documentary, ""School Inc.,"" that examines the problem. The education establishment blames insufficient
funding, even though America's schools ""spend more per student than any country."" And new technology and
methods haven't helped - leaving US education ""stuck in the era of disco and leisure suits."" The problem: ""Most
schools are controlled by government. Government is a monopoly, and monopolies resist change."" Fact is, if
industries ""don't adopt better ways of doing things, [they] go out of business. That forces innovation. But
government-run schools never go out of business"" - so the education establishment ""has no incentive to try
something new.""
Editors: Participation Trophies in the Military?
At the Army's Fort Jackson in South Carolina, Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley ""recently handed out for the first time
certificates of graduation to recruits who completed basic training."" Fortunately, say the editors of The Weekly
Standard, they didn't also hand out ribbons for learning to march and finding the mess hall. But they wonder ""what
kind of message the Army is sending here"" - after all, ""it's called 'basic' training for a reason."" The Army insists it's a
move to ""welcome recruits to the community of soldiers"" and isn't ""given to just anyone."" But ""giving awards for the
most commonplace of military accomplishments still smacks of lowering standards."" And ""if you have to say an
award isn't a dreaded Participation Trophy, it probably is."""
Bank of America,No sweat equity All 34 banks pass Fed stress test," Jun 29, 2017",1,"Big banks passed the Federal Reserve's annual stress test of their financial health - and responded with a
giveaway to investors worth billions of dollars in the form of dividends and share buybacks.
The passing grades mark the first time since the Wall Street crisis of 2008 that all 34 tested firms were deemed
healthy enough to survive a major financial disaster.
The stress test, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, means banks are deemed to have
enough money to avoid a Lehman Brothers-like failure during a hypothetical meltdown.
""I'm pleased that the CCAR process has motivated all of the largest banks to achieve healthy capital levels and
most to substantially improve their capital-planning processes,"" Fed Gov. Jerome Powell said in a statement.
The one bank that stumbled this year was Capital One, which was given until the end of the year to resubmit
stronger plans. Still, the Fed conditionally approved its offer to pay out shareholders.
The biggest winners were Banco Santander, which flunked three consecutive tests, and Deutsche Bank, which failed the past two years.
Overall, the 34 banks are holding onto $1.25 trillion in capital cushions as of the first quarter - more than double
they held in 2009.
A passing grade gives banks the flexibility to return more money to investors.
JPMorgan Chase announced a 6-cent dividend hike, to 56 cents, and $19.4 billion in stock buybacks. Bank of
America boosted its dividend by 60 percent, to 12 cents a share, with another $12 billion in share repurchases.

Bank of America,"There's no biz like GLOW biz As new dramedy airs, lady wrestlers relive glory days"," Jun 23, 2017",1,"During a 1985 audition inside a sweaty Los Angeles gym, a 21-year-old phlebotomist named Jeanne Basone
volunteered to charge head first into the turnbuckle of a wrestling ring and land upside down. Despite having no
wrestling experience, she nailed the difficult maneuver, impressing everyone in the room.
""I just went for it,"" recalls Basone, who was eager to break into show business. For her moxie, she was rewarded
with a role on a new syndicated television show called ""GLOW.""
Bashing your head into a turnbuckle might sound like a bizarre way to get noticed by the entertainment industry,
but nothing about ""GLOW"" - short for the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling - was conventional.
Premiering in 1986, ""GLOW"" was an all-female wrestling program at a time when women were mere sideshows in
the sport. The women were assigned flamboyant alter egos that embraced the more-is-more ethos of the 1980s.
Basone became a wild-child rocker chick named Hollywood, while Lori Palmer morphed into Colonel Ninotchka, a
tall Soviet broad who adopted a Russian accent and sneered at ""weak Americans."" The star of the show wasn't a
sexy bombshell but a 350-pound Samoan-American elite shot-putter, Emily Dole, whose nickname was Mount Fiji.
Each was less politically correct than the next.
Naturally, it was a hit.
""It was holding up a warped mirror to reality,"" says Steve Blance, a writer for the show who also played the referee.
""It talked about pop culture, political stuff.""
Between bouts, the group of women - most of whom were actress wannabes, athletes and stunt women plucked
from obscurity - performed campy comedic skits skewering pop culture and American mores. If ""WWF"" and ""Laugh-
In"" had a love child and dressed it in spandex, you'd get ""GLOW.""
This week, Netflix is dusting off ""GLOW"" and traveling back to the 1980s with a dramedy of the same name,
starring Alison Brie as a Russian ""heel"" (wrestling parlance for a villain). The show premieres Friday. Certainly, this
fictionalized version has more than enough salacious real-life fodder to draw upon.
""The show was bigger than life. There were a lot of colorful characters, and it was very empowering for girls and
women,"" says Basone, who became arguably the show's most popular performer.
The original ""GLOW"" was conceived by wrestling promoter David B. McLane. Israeli businessman Meshulam Riklis,
who owned the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas and was married to Pia Zadora at the time, provided financial backing.
Riklis tapped his old pal Matt Cimber to direct.
Cimber wasn't a wrestling-world carnival barker. The New York native had real Hollywood chops. He was once
married to Jayne Mansfield (whom he directed in a 1964 Broadway revival of ""Bus Stop"") and directed Orson
Welles in 1982's ""Butterfly."" Quentin Tarantino has said Cimber's cult films - he made blaxploitation and psycho
thrillers in the '70s - are among his favorites.
""Isn't it funny, though? I will be remembered for 'GLOW,' "" the now 81-year-old Cimber tells The Post with a chuckle.
Cimber was the show's undisputed creative force, the one who bestowed upon each girl a unique wrestling
persona.
""GLOW,"" which started airing on just a few stations, expanded to more than 100 domestically and was televised in
Germany, Australia and Latin America.
The ""GLOW"" girls made appearances on ""The Sally Jessy Raphael Show"" and ""Married with Children,"" and even
landed on David Letterman's Top Ten Lists. Phil Donohue hosted the ladies on his talk show and he even went into
the ring with Mount Fiji.
Former Mets manager Davey Johnson once admitted that the show was a staple in the Amazins' clubhouse,
according to both Cimber and Blance.
Its fan base also included young women. ""The neat thing was young girls wearing your outfits and crimping their hair like you,"" recalls Basone, who does
stunt work and wrestles for private clients through her company, Hollywould Productions. ""They were screaming
like we were the Beatles.""
Cimber ran a tight ship, complete with midnight curfews at the Riviera, where the show was filmed and the ladies
lived like they were in a sorority.
According to Deanna Booher, who wrestled as the raw-meat-munching Matilda the Hun, he was also ""a real prick.""
""Matt got off on us fighting [behind the scenes],"" she says.
According to the Brett Whitcomb's 2012 documentary, ""GLOW: The Story of the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling,""
Cimber would hurl insults such as, ""Your butt looks like mashed potatoes!""
The 6-foot-3 Booher - who once wrestled a bear - also thought that Cimber and McLane withheld financial
opportunities.
""I missed a million-dollar beer commercial. They felt the show was the star,"" she says.
Still, she has some warm feelings toward Cimber.
""I will always be grateful to him for giving me the part of Matilda,"" Booher says. ""I will never understand him
because he is truly a creative genius. God bless him, he's a mad Italian director.""
Cimber doesn't bristle at her frank assessment.
""Oh yeah, I was [a prick],"" he says, adding that his behavior was well-intentioned. ""I was the worst drill sergeant. I
was really tough because one thing I didn't want was some girl to get injuries because of me. I would say, 'You
have to rehearse, rehearse, rehearse.' Nothing weighed more heavily on me.""
His strict approach didn't bother Ursula Hayden, who played Babe the Farmer's Daughter on the show.
""I followed the rules. I didn't want to be in the ring with someone who'd been out all night at the disco,"" she says.
Basone, however, was as devoted to rule-breaking as she was to her character.
""I didn't know if Matt liked us or hated us, but he was being hard on us like a dad. He didn't want drugs going on,""
she says, adding that she once broke curfew when a ""famous person was in town and I was hanging out with him
in his limo after the concert.""
The stars may have been kept on a short leash off-set, but Cimber saw the show as making a feminist statement.
In 1983, he made a movie called ""Hundra,"" in which the main character was a female version of Conan the
Barbarian. He considers ""Hundra"" the inspiration for ""GLOW.""
""The girls on this show were independent,"" Cimber says. ""They were different. They didn't take orders from men.
This wasn't 'Charlie's Angels,' where a male voice was beaming down on them.""
On camera, the men were scarce, unless they wandered into a well-deserved beatdown.
""The men were always subservient or goofballs,"" Blance says. ""Shows opened with me at the girls' locker room
telling them to get ready for their matches. Somebody would say something, and I would mouth off to her and they
would start pounding on me. That's the whole idea. The men are the buffoons.""
The show ended in 1990, and its old competitor, WWE (then known as WWF), has steadily built up a stable of highprofile
female wrestlers in subsequent years.
This past October, Charlotte Flair and Sasha Banks became the first women ever to headline a pay-per-view WWE
event.
""I don't think it would have been possible without 'GLOW,' "" Blance says.
While it's unclear what led to the demise of ""GLOW,"" it's been reported that Zadora gave Riklis an ultimatum
because he was a little too interested in the female talent.
Netflix, whose show is inspired by Whitcomb's documentary, could have dozens of original ""GLOW"" girls as a
willing resource, but chose to consult only one: Hayden, who acquired the brand's trademark from Riklis in 2001
and has made a living selling DVDs to fans.
Nor were any of the women asked to do cameos - and that feels like a big old body slam to the old cast.
""We can all help each other, and that's what we want,"" Booher says.
The slight isn't personal, insists Hayden. ""If I have one person [on the show], I have to have everyone,"" she says. ""I'm not even in it.""
Meanwhile, Cimber says he will reserve judgment until after he sees the show. But he isn't starting out with warm
feelings.
""Everybody in the industry knows I created 'GLOW.' "" says Cimber. ""I'm ashamed of Netflix. They have this huge
image and here they come along, they take somebody's ideas and format.""
Netflix did not respond to requests for comment.
But despite such mixed feelings, the women say they wouldn't have traded their leotards for anything.
""GLOW gave me empowerment, confidence and the positive outlook that is with me today,"" says Basone, while
Booher called it a ""great sisterhood.""
Many of the girls will gather to watch the show at the home of Tracee Meltzer, who played Roxy Astor and hosts a
popular AfterGLOW cruise event, in which fans mingle with their favorite cast members.
""It's not our time and [Netflix execs] have their reasons for doing what they are doing,"" says Angelina Altishin, who
played Little Egypt. ""We played our role, and now we're on the sidelines.
""And I'll be their biggest cheerleader."""
Bank of America,Jefferies bellwether bomb: blech bond biz," Jun 21, 2017",1,"A bellwether for bond trading just delivered some downbeat news.
Jefferies, a Wall Street boutique bank, said Tuesday that its second-quarter bond trading business slid by a third

percent decline, telling attendees, ""There's not a lot to trade around right now.""
Bank of America will likely see a 10 percent to 15 percent dip in trading revenues, hurt in part by lower interest
rates, CEO Brian Moynihan said at the conference.
Jefferies, run by CEO Richard Handler, reports its quarterly results about a month earlier than most Wall Street
banks - giving a peek at how other, larger banks may have done.
Owned by holding company Leucadia, Jefferies reported $158.6 million in bond trading from February through
May, down 33 percent from the $238.5 million it made during the same period last year."

The Cup, as Boat's editors note, has been described as ""a pissing contest for the world's wealthiest men.""

Turner is described as ""very much par for the course.""

John Bayliss, who started out as a charter boat captain and now has a booming boatbuilding business in the Outer

More interesting is a feature on diving with a twist. The author recounts a diving expedition in the Bahamas on
what's called the S 408, a sporting boat by Pursuit.

Bank of America,CHASE: HIS TALE Hard to re-open hacked accounts Dear John The Answer Man," Jun 18, 2017",1,"Dear John: I have been a customer of Chase Bank for 30 years and am a member of its private banking division.
Recently, I found out that someone hacked into my four accounts and used all my full account numbers - not my
ATM card number - to open a PayPal account.
Fortunately, I found this out and called PayPal, and it closed the fraudulent account.
However, I am being victimized twice, now by Chase.
I contacted Chase to report the hacking and froze my accounts.
Because I retired from New York City to Cape Cod, Mass., where there are no Chase offices, they are unable to open
any new accounts, either by phone or online.
The only way I can get new accounts is to travel to a Chase office in person.
So next week, I have to go to NYC to do this! Their security protocols were already breached by the hacker getting
into my online accounts and opening the PayPal account.
If I could do it without any more hassles, I would just close my Chase accounts and open new ones here. But with
automatic direct deposits of my pension and Social Security, along with bill payment records of account numbers
and addresses for so many years, this would be more time-consuming.
I thought Chase would be more understanding than this. Shame on it! R.K.
Dear R.K.: As you know I tried to get a better outcome, but Chase wouldn't listen to me either.
I suggested that it take care of your problem at a JPMorgan office closer to you - there is a headquarters in Boston.
JPMorgan, of course, is the parent of Chase.
But no dice.
So now everyone knows that if Chase doesn't have an office in your town or if you are planning to move to a place
where the bank doesn't do business, then you might want to consider taking your business somewhere else.
It's nice in NY this time of year, but a 4 /[2] hour trip was unnecessary. Boston is about an hour away from you.
Doing it remotely, of course, would have been best. I hear that some people do banking online these days.
You told me that Chase offered you $100 compensation that you turned down.
Chase told me it is trying to solve this problem for future victims, but added, ""The reality is that anti-money
laundering regulations put significant restrictions on banks like ours on what's required to open a deposit
account.""
Update: It turns out that Chase has since discovered that an account can be online, has updated its customer
service staff and thanked me for helping it discover the oversight."

Bank of America,DOW KERPOW! Index hits 18th peak so far this year," Jun 14, 2017",0,"Call it the Teflon Dow.
The Dow Jones industrial average hit a fresh all-time high on Tuesday - the 18th so far this year - as investors
doubled down on bets that stocks are becoming the best investment to ensure the growth of capital.
And nothing seems to be able to stand in the way of the charging bull - not the former FBI director calling President
Trump a liar, not the Attorney General being questioned about his ties to the Kremlin, not terrorist attacks in Europe
and not even an anemic US economy.
In fact, the Dow surged to a new 52-week high of 21,332.77 as Attorney General Jeff Sessions was testifying
before Congress about any potential contact he had with Russian spies.
""The politics makes for good headlines, but it's economics that affects the bottom line,"" Sam Stovall, an analyst at
CFRA, told The Post.
The Dow closed up 92.8 points, at 21,328.47. The S&P 500, a broader index of US companies, rose 10.96 points, to
2,440.35, a new lifetime high.
The Russell 2000, a gauge of smaller companies, inched up 6.77 points, to 1,425.98, also the peak.
Wall Street experts point to three main reasons the Dow has gained 16 percent since Election Day.
l First, major US companies are expected to emerge from two dismal years of business. The profits of companies
in the S&P 500 are expected to rise to 10.6 percent this year, the first meaningful increase since 2014, Stovall said.
Other measures predict it could grow as much as 20 percent.
Last year, the S&P's growth was about flat. The year before that, it had fallen about 3.5 percent.
l Second, stocks are also starting to see mom-and-pop investors experiencing ""a fear of missing out on the way
up,"" Stovall added.
Investors aren't holding their breath that Trump's agenda will pass any time soon, but Wall Street is still expecting
some promised tax cuts down the line.
Not everyone is convinced that the stock market will head in only one direction.
""Capitalism's arteries are now clogged or even blocked,"" superstar bond manager Bill Gross said in a Tuesday note
that warned of increasing risks of a turnaround.
And 44 percent of investors are nervous that stocks are too expensive, up from 37 percent last month, according to a Bank of America survey.
l Third, investors remain optimistic that some of Trump's economic stimulus moves - tax cuts, regulation rollbacks
- will come to pass.
While many on Wall Street now believe Trump's tax overhaul, tax cuts and infrastructure spending will not happen
until next year, they still are optimistic such measures could come sooner rather than later, Wall Street pros said.
Sky's not the limit
Here's where we've gone in the seven months since Trump was elected president:
* Bigwigs, jonesing for tax cuts and regulation rollbacks, jump into the market.
* Main Street develops severe case of FOMO, joins party
* US companies' earnings are finally growing

Shakespeare in the Park's version of ""Julius Caesar"" isn't long on subtlety, says Charlie Martin at PJ Media: Caesar
""is played as a man with a bad comb-over and an overlong tie,"" his wife is ""a runway model with a Slavic accent,""
and he's assassinated by the Senate's ""women and minorities."" The ""Upper West Side friends"" of the producer and

Historians: Reagan Berlin Wall Speech Still Resonates
It was 30 years ago this week that President Ronald Reagan, the Great Communicator, added a ""phrase for the

1987, he visited the Berlin Wall to commemorate the city's 750th anniversary. Addressing himself to the Soviet
premier, he declared: ""Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!"" Some thought it was an overly provocative mistake; but
Reagan had ""looked the Soviet Union straight in the eye and did not blink."" In 1989, the Wall fell and Communist
governments followed suit. Those nations ""all looked to the fall of the Wall as an example of the power of the
people against an oppressive government. And the people looked to Reagan as the fire to light that spark for
freedom.""

the fact that ""Britain lacks the highly partisan media landscape that has long defined the United States,"" and
enjoys ""a credible, high-quality, trusted public broadcaster in the form of the BBC."" In this country, the First
Amendment's ""constitutional provision for a marketplace of ideas . . . does not ensure that this marketplace will be
of high quality."" Yes, the BBC has been accused of ""an institutional left-wing bias."" But it provides ""high-quality

Mike Mayo, the outspoken bank analyst who's compared himself to French painter Paul Cezanne, has landed a
new job at Wells Fargo, the bank announced on Monday.
The financial gadfly - who was bearish on Wall Street's biggest banks for 16 years - was let go from his last job at
Hong Kong-based brokerage CLSA in April, but had kept himself busy with cable news appearances and popping
up at bank meetings.
Mayo, 54, said he explored all his options, including starting his own firm, before ultimately deciding to go with
Wells Fargo.
""They gave me the freedom to do my research,"" he told The Post.
Mayo has made a reputation of going after big banks. His pointed criticism of former Citigroup Chief Executive
Chuck Prince contributed to the exec's ouster.
He's also gone after JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America bigs for pocketing fat compensation packages while
their stock prices stagnated.
In the 1990s, he worked for Credit Suisse First Boston. That relationship came to an end in 2000 after he told his
clients to sell all their bank stocks."
Bank of America,Amex joins Ides of march," Jun 13, 2017",1,"All the world's a stage - but corporate donors Delta Airlines, Bank of America and now American Express, don't
want to be caught in the spotlight.
All three companies have distanced themselves from the Public Theater's controversial Shakespeare in the Park
production of ""Julius Caesar,"" which depicts the assassination of a leader who resembles President Trump.
American Express was initially reluctant to sling arrows at the nonprofit organization staging the play in Central
Park, but The Post discovered that the financial- services giant's banner had been removed from the Public
Theater's Web site on Monday afternoon.
Public Theater Artistic Director Oskar Eustis, in an open letter on the play's Web site, urged everyone to keep their
heads:
""Julius Caesar is about how fragile democracy is. And in case you were wondering: No, we didn't write any new
lines. It's all Shakespeare.""
In the modern-era adaptation (above) of the 400-year-old play, based on the true story of the Roman dictator who
was knifed by conspirators, Caesar is dressed in a business suit with a red tie and wears a blond wig.
It is being staged at the park's outdoor Delacorte Theater, where tickets are free, through June 18.
The production comes on the heels of comedian Kathy Griffin's video in which she gripped a bloodied rendering of
the president's head.
On Sunday, Donald Trump Jr. retweeted a Fox News story about the play and wrote, ""I wonder how much of this
'art' is funded by taxpayers? Serious question, when does 'art' become political speech &does that change things?""
Delta responded by saying the play ""crossed the line,"" while Bank of America said it felt deceived.
American Express said it did not ""condone this interpretation of the play"" - but added that it would remain a
sponsor of the Public Theater's 2017-2018 season in the East Village.
Defenders of the new adaptation include city Comptroller Scott Stringer, who tweeted, ""What a mistake. Actually
reading Julius Caesar might help in the future. Your copy is in the mail.""
Mayor de Blasio said New York City will continue funding the Public Theater - and he wouldn't mind if he were the
one portrayed as Caesar.
""It's a cautionary tale about the decline of democracy, about the horrible impact of political violence . . . It is literally
decrying the horrible effect of political violence,"" he said on NY1."

Bank of America,Blast of our past The Puerto Rican parade is celebrating a thug who brought deadly terrorism to NYC for the first time in history," Jun 11, 2017",0,"The heinous FALN bomb attack on Fraunces Tavern on Jan. 24, 1975, first brought terror home to modern-day New
York City. Let's not forget this on Sunday, June 11, when remorse-free FALN mastermind Oscar Lopez Rivera -
turned loose by former President Barack Obama after serving half of his 70-year prison sentence - marches in the
Puerto Rican Day Parade at the charmed invitation of City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito.
There's good reason why Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello told The Post that the invitation to Lpez Rivera was
""beyond comprehension."" Most of us New Yorkers in 1975 naively believed random slaughter in service of political lunacy was a distant
problem that didn't concern us. Palestinian zealots murdered Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics and hijacked
airliners all over the Middle East and Europe. Kidnapped heiress Patty Hearst and her SLA cohorts shot up a bank
in San Francisco - but lethal terrorism just couldn't happen in New York.
Some amateurish, small-scale terrorist efforts prior to 1975 fortunately killed no one. Other plots were foiled before
they could happen. The FALN atrocities shook us out of our complacency - for a time.
A decade of middle-class flight left the city mainly to a handful of the very rich and legions of the very poor. In
between were mostly young, ambitious, artsy-minded types for whom crumbling streets and ruined neighborhoods
made a romantic backdrop for adventure. Times Square squalor was merely colorful. But nobody counted on
senseless atrocities perpetrated by agents of foreign powers.
The NYPD and FBI found numerous, poorly made unexploded bombs around town prior to the Fraunces Tavern
bombing. But the lunchtime attack, which killed four people and injured 50 more, was clearly the work of trained
professionals.
The FALN wanted Puerto Rican independence - a cause embraced by no one in New York or in Puerto Rico. In a
1967 referendum, 60.4 percent of island residents voted for continued commonwealth status; 39 percent for
statehood; and a scant 0.6 percent for independence. But FALN made no pretense of being a grass-roots
movement; it was a Marxist neo-insurgency aligned with Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, who sought to dislodge
legitimate governments in South and Central America and the Caribbean. FALN's dream for Puerto Rican
""independence"" was a replica of Communist Cuba.
An FALN member told The Associated Press that historic landmark Fraunces Tavern restaurant had been chosen
as the target to kill ""reactionary corporate executives"" who lunched there. A written message warned New York,
""You have unleashed a storm from which you comfortable Yankis [sic] cannot escape."" (Although Lpez Rivera
didn't light the fuse himself, he was super-high-up in the organization and has not renounced terrorism since the
attack.)
The FALN struck again in April, planting bombs at four Manhattan locations that killed no one. A bomb at La
Guardia Airport in December killed 11; Croatian separatists were suspected but the case was never solved. There
were further non-lethal but destructive bombings by FALN in 1982 and 1983. After those, the threat seemed to
recede. New Yorkers were more vexed by fleeing business, skyrocketing crime, the burning Bronx and the AIDS
explosion than by terrorism fears - until the Feb. 26, 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.
Things seem different since 9/11, of course. Today we don't recoil from the sight of cops and soldiers toting
machine guns at landmarks like Grand Central Terminal. We ""say something if we see something."" Yet, even now,
we might not have learned our lesson.
Not militants, but voters - many of whom lived through the hell of 9/11 - elected Mark-Viverito to office. Her council
colleagues elevated her to the speaker role despite her public embrace of the nihilist Occupy Wall Street movement
and her snubbing of the Pledge of Allegiance. They held their noses over her deifying of Lpez Rivera because, one
council member told The Post, they feared objecting would ""make her mad"" and lose her support for projects in
their districts.
Profiles in courage, 2017-style.
Terrorism has many roots and causes, but it thrives in part because the world's Mark-Viveritos enable it - and the
rest of us let those of her kind get away with it."

Trump wants to leverage $200 billion in his budget proposal into $1 trillion worth of projects.
He pointed to a government program that allows the private sector to tap into low-cost government loans called
the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act as a way to leverage federal cash with state, local
and private-sector funding.
Trump also said the Senate needed to pass health-care reform and took a bow for reviving the Keystone Pipeline
and cutting what he called burdensome business regulations.
Sounding relaxed and relieved to be away from the Beltway pressure cooker, Trump also reminisced about his Ohio
election victory and said he takes ""so much heat for nonsense.""
He even noted the 12 river barges moored in the Ohio.
""Those barges have been waiting for us to say hello. The captain says please wave. Hello, captain! He put up that
big beautiful American flag,"" the president said.
Trump also praised his controversial decision to pull the US out of what he derided as the ""so-called"" Paris climate
accord.
""We will never have outside forces telling us what to do and how to do it,"" he said.
And he urged Democrats to support his policies - while predicting that they wouldn't. ""I'm calling on all Democrats and Republicans to join together if that's possible, in the great rebuilding of America.
[But] they're just obstructionist. Every single thing is obstruction,"" he said.

more inclusive term for non-binary gender identity.
Nothing makes you feel your age as much as slang does.
""Much slang starts out as a kind of low-level guerilla warfare directed at straight society, designed to keep out the
squares, or annoy them, or both, and is then abandoned by the group which originated it once the words have
become common currency,"" writes Max Decharne in ""Vulgar Tongues: An Alternative History of English Slang""
(Pegasus Books, out June 6.)
Decharne traces the origins of favorite colloquialisms - from the rough and tumble Shakespearean era (or earlier),
when slang was associated with ""thieves, beggars, and those on the margins of society,"" to today. Here's a history
of some of our most familiar slang, as adapted from ""Vulgar Tongues.""
BROTHEL
As a name for a house of ill repute, brothel has been a part of common English since the end of the 16th century,
but is also something of a misnomer.: Two centuries earlier, a brothel was simply a loose-living, disreputable man.
In Chaucer's England, with the lingering influence of the Normans, the accepted term was bordel. To the
Elizabethans, these were bawdyhouses, trugging-places, nunneries, leaping-houses or vaulting-houses - the last
two intended to conjure up the supposedly vigorous activities found within such a spot
PIMP
The word pimp itself dates back to the London of Shakespeare's time. It is a testimony to the staying power of this
particular word that it has managed to remain in current use while other terms for the same occupation have fallen
by the wayside. Centuries before this, such a person would have been called a pander (1450), a bed-broker (1594),
fleshmonger (1616) or a mutton-broker (1694). Over time, though, ""pimp"" has become the default
ARSE
While dictionaries now categorize the word arse as vulgar, for almost a thousand years it was merely standard
English, yet bottom, by contrast, dates only to the 1790s. Indeed, utter the word arse to an Anglo-Saxon in the runup
to the Norman Conquest, and they would certainly have known what you were talking about - although if they
belonged to that select minority of the population who could actually write, they would most likely spell it ""aers"" or
even ""ears""
HOOLIGAN
Another favorite all-purpose word, dating back to late 19th-century London, hooligan is said to be derived from the
thuggish activities of a particular family gang from South London called O'Hoolihan or O'Hooligan. These were
both reasonably common Irish surnames - indeed, in an unrelated case in Manchester, an Elisabeth Hooligan was
sentenced to a year's imprisonment in 1880 for the theft of a jacket - but by the following decade, the word had
passed into newspaper reports as shorthand for a certain type of violent anti-social behavior
GANGSTER
The term itself has American origins, first recorded in the 1880s, but its usage then spread over to Britain, with a
helping hand from the media. While this story may appear to have all the hallmarks of the late-1920s heyday of
mob violence, it actually dates from May 1913. After the First World War was over, the word appeared in The New
York Times, in a favorable review of the motion picture ""Skin Deep"" (1923), whose star Milton Sills was described
as ""a repulsively ugly New York criminal gangster.""
THE CLINK
One of the oldest slang term for a prison derives its name from a real institution - London's the Clink, on the
southern bank of the Thames, which entertained numerous malefactors from the I2th century up until its
destruction in the Gordon Riots of 1780. GETTIN 'HIGH'
During much of the past hundred years, it has been common to say that a person in a state of intoxication through
drugs is high, yet this is merely adopting a 17th-century expression for drunkenness. Indeed, the first known
instance of ""high"" meaning ""drunk"" occurs in Ben Jonson's play ""Volpone"" in 1607.
BOOTLEGGER
Originally, in 17th-century England, a bootleg was simply that, the leg of a tall boot. However, in America at the
close of the 19th century, the term bootlegger came to assume its modern, alcohol-related meaning. An 1890
edition of a New York publication called The Voice explained things as follows: ""The ""boot-legger is a grim spectre
to the anti-Prohibitionist...He is a man who wears boots in whose tops are concealed a flask or two of liquor.""
WINO
One of the first recorded uses of the term wino appeared in the classic 1926 hobo memoir by Jack Black, ""You
Can't Win"": ""The wine dumps, where wine bums . . . hung out, interested me. Long, dark, dirty rooms with rows of
rickety tables and a long bar behind which were barrels of the deadly 'foot juice' or 'red ink,' as the winos called it.""
In the early 1990s, when Johnny Depp was engaged to Winona Ryder, he had the words Winona Forever tattooed
on his right arm. Forever turned out to be somewhere in the region of three years, after which they split, and he
famously had it altered to read Wino Forever.
HIP
One supposed explanation of the origins of the jazz term hip was that it derived from the practice of lying around
on your side all day in opium dens, so that your hip joint eventually deteriorated over time. Thereafter, the story
goes, other regular users could tell you from the uneven way you walked - 'He's on the hip, he's a hip guy.'
WEED
The word weed - which dates back over a thousand years to Anglo-Saxon times and denoted a wild plant of no
value or benefit - was used in US blues and jazz circles as a term for marijuana since the mid-1920s.
FLY
The slang word fly was in use in London two hundred years ago, and is recorded in the third edition of Francis
Grose's ""Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue"" from 1811: ""FLY: Knowing. Acquainted with another's meaning
or proceeding."" By the time of the fourth edition, revised by Pierce Egan in 1823, the definition had expanded to
also include the following: 'vigilant, suspicious, cunning, not easily robbed or duped."" Which, of course, would make
them, as California punk band The Offspring might have said in 1998, ""Pretty Fly For A White Guy.""
CRIB
In medieval England, the word was applied to the wooden stalls in which farmyard animals slept, but by
Shakespeare's time it could also mean a small rough dwelling for human habitation. Eventually, it was established
English criminal slang for a home. Pierce Egan's 1823 version of ""Vulgar Tongue"" details its use as burglar's
terminology: ""CRIB. A house. To crack a crib: to break open a house.""
RAP
The word rap itself has been slang for centuries, denoting all manner of things. For example, in the time of Henry
VIII, the OED informs us, it meant ""the act of breaking wind."" The generally accepted first use of the word rap in the
modem context lyric occurs in the 1965 song ""Michael (The Lover),"" by Chicago soul vocal trio the C.O.D.s, a
Motown influenced romantic dance number all about a smooth-talking charmer - ""the girls think that his rap is
strong.""
GOTH
Consider the following, from Farmer 8C Henley's ""Slang and Its Analogues"" (1890), in which the term's association
derives not from vampires and Gothic churchyards, but rather the Visigoth army who sacked Rome in the year 410:
""GOTH - A frumpish or uncultured person; one behind the times or ignorant of the ways of society."""
Bank of America,FORWARD FRAUD Crooks divert mail to gain access Dear John The Answer Man," Jun 4, 2017",0,"Dear John: You may think you have heard it all, but you haven't.
Just before Memorial Day last year, we realized we weren't receiving any mail. We went to the post office and
fortunately ran into our postman headed in for the day.
We asked about our mail and he said, ""It's going to your Philadelphia address for two weeks.""
We don't have a Philadelphia address. Someone filed a forwarding on our mail. They then intercepted checking
account statements, credit card bills, etc., then ordered new checks and applied for new debit and credit cards.
The post office said anyone can do it. We asked if you needed ID and were told no, you can do it online.
And the fakers who file the forwarding order get a personal identification number (PIN) that is needed to reverse
the fraudulent order.
Call the postmaster general and check it out. All someone needs is your home address. The rest is elementary.
Now you've heard it all.
F.J.
Dear F.J.: I bet someone can top that. I wonder if you can have only your bills sent somewhere else.
I was hoping you were going to say that the postal police went to the Philly address and arrested the scoundrels,
but I guess no such luck.
Thanks for warning others. Everyone, if your mail delivery looks unusual, check with the post office.
Dear John: I enjoyed your article about the low-tech post office ""scam."" Please be aware, however, that there is
another similar technique being used and the USPS doesn't seem to care a whit about it.
A few months ago, I happened across a large pile of mail on the side of the road. Out of curiosity, I examined it, and
discovered that while most envelopes had been opened, all were addressed to different recipients. The entire
bundle of 100 to 200 pieces of mail were held together with a glue-like substance. It was clear that a thief had
poured this goo into a mailbox (all had been mailed from the same box), and simply pulled the entire bundle out as
one big mass. All of these pieces of mail were permanently glued together in one big lump.
For what it's worth, I took the time to notify, by various means, all of the people who I could see had been
victimized. I notified them of missing rent and utility checks, and even forwarded some personal mail along with a
note of explanation to all.
I also notified the post office. It seemed extremely uninterested in my report. I made a number of attempts to
speak with anybody who might eventually care.
I am convinced that mail theft investigation is a very low priority to many (most?) postmasters. K.C.
Dear K.C.: Did you see an envelope in the bundle to me from Publishers Clearing House? I'm expecting a check.
I don't know what to say. I've personally had very few problems with the US Postal Service. But when I hear these
stories, I'm grateful that e-mail was invented.
Dear John: Postal crooks also wrap a wire coat hanger with double-sided tape and put it down the chute. They can
lift light envelopes containing checks right up. V.T. Dear V.T.: Thanks.
Imagine what these crooks could accomplish if they decided to get legitimate jobs.
Wells Fargo keeps him in checks
Dear John: In my experience, finding a stale check isn't that unusual - although finding one for more than $1,000 is.
I get dividend checks from Wells Fargo and my hit rate on depositing them is no better than 50 percent. Every
couple of years it sends me a letter yelling at me for not depositing a list of the following checks, then the list of
checks. I then tick the box and send it back, and Wells Fargo sends me a check for the undeposited dividends and
tells me to tear up the old checks.
I've tried to sign up for direct deposit, but while I won't bore you with the details, the bank doesn't make it easy.

Bank of America,Hollywood over Hill Losing candidate bashed for not moving on ON THE MONEY," Jun 4, 2017",0,"Hollywood has had its fill of Hillary Clinton's endless dissection of what went wrong with the election.
Enough already, said one of our Tinseltown tattlers who watched Clinton's fireside chat with Recode boss Kara
Swisher last week in horror.
""She needs to be talking about being a female leader, what she's doing next,"" this person said, adding that the
blame game is getting nauseating.
There were groans all around when Clinton appeared at Recode's Code conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.,
and lashed out at the lousy state of the Democratic National Commitee's data operation.
""It was mediocre to poor, nonexistent, wrong. I had to inject money into it,"" she said. (The DNC's data guru, Andrew
Therriault, tweeted that such comments were ""f--king bulls--t."" The tweets are now deleted.)
While President Obama picked up $400,000 for a speech delivered at A&E's History Channel upfront event a few
weeks ago, Clinton apparently gave Swisher a nice big freebie, appearing without charge.
Recode is owned by Vox Media, whose editor-in-chief, Ezra Klein, made several viral videos supporting Clinton's
candidacy.
The former Democratic presidential nominee is also out promoting a new memoir to be released this fall by Simon
and Schuster. It is yet untitled.
Say cheese
We think Vivendi boss Vincent Bollor may have watched the latest Diane Lane flick, ""Paris Can Wait,"" about a
couple who tours France, eating the finest foods and delaying their arrival in the capital.
Like every good Frenchman, Bollor seems to have food on his mind, even when mapping out future business plans.
The Vivendi chairman - who is the top shareholder in the French media and telecom company - confirmed last
week he is considering a public offering of Universal Music Group.
Universal and its two rivals, Sony Music and Warner, are seeing a rising tide, thanks to the revenue growth from
streaming. Vivendi has pegged the value of Universal, which houses artists such as Ariana Grande (pictured), at an
eye-popping $22 billion.
Bollor told a shareholder, ""The value of [UMG] increases every day, and it's true that an IPO would be an interesting
thing,"" before adding, ""the key question is to know when is the best time to do it. It's like cheese puffs - you have to
take them out at the right moment,"" Reuters reported.

Bank of America,Bears waking up Banks see summer revenue crawling off," Jun 1, 2017",1,"US banks are planning for a bummer summer.
At least two large banks on Wednesday warned of a double-digit drop in second-quarter trading revenue as one of
their biggest businesses, bond trading, suffers from tranquil markets and the Federal Reserve's easy-money
policies.
JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US bank, is bracing for a 15 percent slide in bond trading - in part because optimism
on Wall Street about President Trump's tax-cutting agenda has kept markets so stable.
""There's not a lot to trade around right now,"" Marianne Lake, JPM's chief financial officer, said as she disclosed the
bank's glum forecast at an industry conference.
JPM isn't the only bank preparing for a dip.
Bank of America will likely see a 10 percent to 12 percent dip in trading revenues, hurt in part by lower interest
rates, Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America, said at the conference.
The bearish news sent bank stocks down for the day. JPM shares fell 2.1 percent, to $82.15. BofA declined 1.9
percent, to $22.41. Goldman Sachs was off 3.3 percent, to $211.26. And Morgan Stanley was down 1.3 percent, to
$41.74.
Market shocks are good for the trading business, since they give traders a reason to buy bonds off spooked
investors, then turn around and sell them to bullish ones.
But with corporate profits rising, a strong labor market, and economic confidence near all-time highs, market
shocks have been few and far between - leaving the bond market as dry as dust.
""There haven't been that many idiosyncratic events, and we need a few more of them,"" Lake added.
The comparisons with last year's second quarter will be tough as banks in 2016 saw a boost in trading late in the
quarter thanks to the surprise results from the UK vote to leave the European Union.
Last year, Lake said that there had been a ""spike"" in trading thanks to the ""Brexit."

Bank of America,SAVING DISGRACE Catch-22 keeps interest rates low Dear John The Answer Man," May 28, 2017",1,"Dear John: So often I read your take on the jobs report and say, ""I didn't know that"" or ""I like that slant.""
Your recent column on savings was informative and made me think.
Low interest rates have been just what the doctor ordered for the supposed 1 percent or so, but a large part of the
remainder of the country is saddled with credit card debt that requires a huge percentage of their income to
service.
I'm not sure there are any savers left in this country, sadly. T.K.
Dear T.K.: Sure, there are savers.
They are the consumers who would be spending money right now to get the economy going but who aren't
because the Federal Reserve has imposed a secret tax - by way of lost interest income.
So they'll just sit on their hands and say, ""Screw it, this car can last another year"" and ""We'll go out to dinner less
this month.""
They aren't broke. They are comfortable because they have money in the bank. And that's where it's going to stay
until the Fed can finally get interest rates back to normal levels.
Which, of course, can't happen until people start spending and the economy gets going ... which, of course, won't
happen until interest rates get back to normal levels ... which, of course, won't happen until people start spending
and get the economy going.
Dear John: As a NJ resident, I wonder what the underlying reason is for the holding back of thousands of tax
refund checks.
On April 14, I received a notice requesting backup for my electronically returned filing, which the state received on
March 8.
Yesterday, I called the state hotline, which now has a recorded message indicating high activity levels.
The Web site shows my backup info has been received. If approved, expect 90 days from receipt of that backup
before I can expect to get a refund.
Being retired, my backup was a 1099 form in which I removed 401(k) funds.
Historically I've received refunds in March. Seems like July is extreme in delay tactics. D.M.
Dear D.M.: New Jersey said it was using ""additional tools"" to protect taxpayers from fraud.
It warned that there would be delays and that electronically filed returns would take up to four weeks ""to validate
and process."" Returns filed on paper ""may take a minimum of 12 weeks.""
Then you know how it works - someone has to find the Pony Express driver, get him in the saddle and send him to
your house with the refund. He's not Santa, you know!
New Jersey says to check your refund status at its online refund service Web site before calling the refund hotline at (800) 323-4400.
Someone who is a skeptic at heart might think New Jersey just wants to keep your refund a little longer so the
state can use the money in the meantime. But, nah, that can't be it.
Employees forced to take stock

Bank of America,Can't 'Heidi' my concerns about Swiss holdings," May 23, 2017",0,"Who or what is keeping stock prices up even as there is continuous economic and political turmoil around the
world?
Could it be Switzerland?
Stock prices fell sharply last Wednesday when the latest ""scandal"" - and I don't even remember what it was - struck
the Trump administration. I mentioned in a column on Thursday my Top 10 reasons US investors should be wary of ever-rising stock prices.
One of the 10 things was the manipulation of equities markets by countries like China and Japan, which proudly
admit to doing so.
And then there's the mysterious case of Switzerland, which has an enormous portfolio of US stocks - and no
obvious reason that it keeps buying.
According to its last filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Swiss National Bank owned more
than $63 billion worth of stock - most of it in US companies.
In fact, that amount was $1 billion higher than it was in the previous quarterly filing with the SEC.
Since large shareholders are only required to make quarterly reports to the SEC, there's no telling how active the
Swiss National Bank is on a given day or whether it jumps in to support weak markets.
The latest filing included more than 15 million shares of Apple, 13 million Intel, 25 million General Electric, 6.6
million Facebook, 10 million Ford, 13 million Intel and on and on and ...
In fact, a printed list of all the stocks is 66 pages long.
No matter what the motive is for the purchase of all that stock, the end result is the same - it's helping to prop up
stock prices.
And, I admit, the reason for the Swiss appetite for stocks could be nothing more than investment purposes. Like
everyone else, the Swiss National Bank could be buying simply because the returns elsewhere - like in the bond
market - are so abysmal.
But is it possible that the Swiss are acting as an agent of US financial authorities who fear that a big decline in
stock prices would be against America's national interest?
OK, I hear people shouting ""conspiracy theory"" already. So let's get a little deeper into history.
Central banks around the world have always come to one another's rescue in currency markets. If America, for
instance, wanted the US dollar to be stronger than it is, a foreign central bank like Switzerland's would purchase
dollars on behalf of the US.
Mission accomplished. And nobody is the wiser that the US was behind the propping up of the dollar.
Here's another fact. A guy named Robert Heller, who had been a governor on the Federal Reserve Board, proposed
in 1989 that the Fed rig the US stock market in the event of an emergency.
Heller said this should be done only in dire situations, like the stock market crash of 1987 and the near crash just a
month before he proposed this. Heller argued that rigging stocks - through the purchase by the Federal Reserve of
stock index futures contracts - would be no harder than manipulating the currency markets.
Why is this one of the things investors should worry about? Because there's no telling why the Swiss National
Bank is buying all that stock and when it will stop. As so with other investors, if interest rates rise high enough, the
Swiss may decide that stocks aren't worth the risk.
So, all I have to say is: Go, Switzerland! You buy our stocks , and we'll eat your chocolate.
It seems like a fair deal.

Everyone knows by now that companies can - and do - manipulate their per-share earnings to meet Wall Street
expectations.
But I've always worked on the assumption that corporate revenues were pure numbers - without much
manipulation going on there.
Well, it turns out that I was wrong. In the current issue of Accounting Horizons, put out by the American
Accounting Association - I read it so you won't have to - a story with the can't-put-down title of ""Revenue
Benchmark Beating and the Sector Level Investor Pricing of Revenue and Earnings"" details ""the propensity of
companies to exactly meet or slightly beat analysts' forecasts in conformity with the priorities of investors.""
Still don't understand? Companies are fudging their revenues as well as their earnings. And that should make
investors very nervous.
How do they do it? Rong Zhao, assistant professor of accounting at the University of Calgary, did the study and said revenue cheaters, especially in service industries, sometimes book as sales whatever they receive from
customers even when some of that revenue actually belongs to a third party.
For instance, one internet company got caught counting as revenue all the money it received from customers. But
the internet company was just the go-between, so some of that ""revenue"" belonged to clients - like restaurants or
theaters - that were actually performing the service.
A computer company might sell software and a service contract. While only the sale of the software should be
counted as revenue, some companies inappropriately also count the long- term contract as revenue.
That's cheating.
Companies also ""channel stuff,"" meaning they send customers a lot of product they don't want at the end of the
quarter to make things look better.
So there you have it - at least 11 reasons you should be wary of the markets."
Bank of America,Frome Here 2 Eternity ALL FOR 2 Fitting tribute for legendary shortstop," May 15, 2017",1,"The first chants began in earnest at 6:28 p.m., though the diehards who had arrived 4 1/2 hours earlier to enjoy an
old-fashioned, single-admission doubleheader had really led things off during the roll call before Game 1. The guest
of honor's name always did have the most mellifluous meter of all.
""DE-REK JE-TER!
DE-REK JE-TER!!
DE-REK JE-TER!!""
The Yankees had already paid Jeter a fitting tribute, twice erasing two-run deficits to the Astros. The first of those
had vanished thanks to a two-run homer off the bat of Starlin Castro in the fourth inning, and it was perfect: an
inside-out swing, a twisting line drive toward the W.B. Mason, Sony Square and Bank of America signs in right field,
and a soft landing just beyond the 314-foot sign.
Ever seen one of those before?
But the celebration was really starting now. Ticket holders had been urged to be in their seats by 6:30 and they had
obliged and obeyed, every upper corner occupied, every section stuffed with the faithful. Kool and the Gang sang
about celebrations, and the people obliged. And they were ready to explode.
And at precisely 6:45 they did, when Jeter gave a tug to a tangle of rope beyond center field and a pinstriped No. 2
was revealed. On the wall. Out of circulation. Forever. Then came the sentence Yankees fans will hear in their
fondest baseball dreams forever, courtesy of the late Bob Sheppard:
Now batting for the Yankees, Num-bah Two, Derek. Jeter. Num-bah Two ...
""He was a dream for a manager to manage,"" Joe Torre had said about an hour earlier.
Torre and Jeter will, of course, always be linked because Torre was a baseball lifer who had never spent one inning
in a World Series until the kid with the No. 2 on his back showed up. Together they would play in six of them, win
four. Torre's No. 6 is already on the wall in Monument Park.
He knows why. Nobody ever has to tell him.
""There was so much about him that didn't show up in stats,"" Torre said. ""Not the most talented player, but for some
reason you wanted the ball hit to him or him at the plate. He never disappointed.""
When he arrived in 1996, he was ""Mr. Torre"" to Jeter, and later ""Mr. T."" Torre has just one way to describe Jeter:
""Who was the best player I ever managed? It's an easy choice.""
""He doesn't like being the center of attention,"" Torre said. ""But sorry, pal. You brought this on yourself.""
There were 32 white chairs flanking the table on which Jeter's plaque was mounted, and for a few minutes
Yankees fans were allowed to float back to 1996 again, and 1998, '99 and 2000 again, to the grand expanse of
Jeter's grand career, teammates and family members and Steinbrenners.
When it was finally time for him to talk, he kept it brief and he kept it simple, which was hardly a surprise. You knew
Jeter wasn't going to filibuster.
""What do you say on a day like this?"" he asked, and the fans had an answer of course:
""DE-REK JE-TER!
DE-REK JE-TER!!
DE-REK JE-TER!!"" ""There isn't a person or a player I would have traded places with that's playing now or ever,"" Jeter said. ""I got a
chance to play for a first-class organization and for the greatest fans in the history of sports.""
The man always did know his audience.
""Time flies, memories fade, but family is forever,"" he said. ""I'll be eternally grateful to be a part of the Yankees
family.""
And that was it. There were no over-the-top extended ovations, which actually seemed exactly right. And even if the
people were so inclined, they would have been drowned out, first by Tina Turner crooning ""Simply the Best"" through
the P.A. system, later by a snippet of Blues Image:
Ride, captain ride, upon your mystery ship
Be amazed, at the friends, You have here on your trip ...
Ride, captain ride, upon your mystery ship
On your way to a world that others might have missed ...
And then he was gone, and as they prepared the field for a baseball game, and as he left the field one last time,
hearing his name, he looked exactly as he'd looked so often in this very corner of the neighborhood: very much at
peace. Good for him."
Bank of America,Full stream ahead Warner Music near royalty deal with Spotify ON THE MONEY," May 14, 2017",0,"Fresh off a pact to license music to YouTube, Warner Music boss Steve Cooper is turning his attention to music
streamer Spotify - and a deal could be signed by June.
Sources tell On the Money that Warner and Spotify are getting thisclose to a new royalty agreement. If inked,
Daniel Ek's Spotify would be on the way to its long-planned IPO - expected in the final quarter of 2017.
Spotify signed new long-term deals with Universal Music Group and with independent music representative Merlin
last month.
Spotify has yet to get Sony Music to the table. The streamer has been looking for labels to take a cut in their fees
so Spotify has a path to profitability. A source said: "" We're looking for a deal where both sides share in the risks
and rewards."" Spotify is offering up more data and a greater share of guaranteed revenue. It currently gives 55
percent of all revenue back to the labels.
The labels do not want to be solely reliant on the big tech giants such as Apple, Google and Amazon for revenue.
Spotify has proven it is willing to be more flexible about launching new music on its paid tier instead of giving it
away for free. It's also got a sizable lead on music streamers, with more than 50 million paid subscribers. Spotify
confirmed it hired banks Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Allen &Co. to advise on an IPO.
Whether Spotify's big valuation can aid interest in Pandora remains to be seen.
Tweet endorsement
Alphabet may be breathing a big sigh of relief.
Interim Federal Trade Commission Chair Maureen Ohlhausen has risen to become the favorite to land the
permanent spot in what would be a surprise, a source told our Josh Kosman.
Ohlhausen was an FTC commissioner when the regulator voted in 2013 to close an investigation into Google's
alleged monopolistic activity.
The former favorite to be FTC Chair, Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, was far more likely to open a probe into
whether Alphabet improperly pressured mobile phone makers to install Google apps on their phones, sources said.
Former FTC Commissioner Josh Wright, who was on President Trump's Department of Justice transition team,
may have tipped the scales for Ohlhausen in a May 9 tweet stating that she ""will make an excellent chair"" and the
appointment to the position was ""long overdue.""
Wright has not always been friendly with the fellow Republican Ohlhausen, the source said, making his
endorsement even more noteworthy.
Trump would find it easier to name Ohlhausen, since she would not require Senate confirmation as she has already been confirmed.

of a New York City taxi.
Robin Roberts, a co-anchor of ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" also told emcee Rosanna Scotto that she now gets

meditation, or TM.
Roberts and Bundchen were among the honorees at the awards dinner.

Bank of America,SPECIAL DAY Mother's sacrifice brought Jason opportunity to achieve golfing dreams," May 14, 2017",1,"PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. - Mother's Day, indeed.
They celebrate the holiday in Australia just like we do in America. Unfortunately for Jason Day, he won't be able to
spend Mother's Day on Sunday with his ""mum,"" as he calls Adenil ""Dening"" Day.
He'll be trying to win the Players Championship as he competes in the final round on the TPC Sawgass Stadium
Course, where he's seven shots off the lead after shooting 73 Saturday.
Day's mother departed for home in Brisbane, Australia, last month after spending the better part of the previous
three months with Day at his home in Columbus, Ohio, while recovering from lung cancer surgery.
Day, the former top-ranked player in the world and current No. 3, implored his 60-year-old mother to stay in the
States, stay in Ohio near him, where he can look after her the way she looked after him when he was younger.
""I understand why she went home, but it was difficult,"" Day told The Post. ""I said to her, 'You don't have to worry
about working anymore.' The retirement age back home is 67, and she's 60. That's seven more years of working,
which is a pretty long time - especially after you have a benign tumor in your breast six years back and now she's
had lung cancer.""
Day has $33.7 million in winnings since 2009. That doesn't include tens of millions more in endorsements from his
companies such as Adidas and TaylorMade. If he never makes another nickel, he has enough money to care for his
mother, his two sisters, Yanna and Kim, his wife, Ellie, and their two children 20 times over.
""I told my mum, 'Just relax and enjoy the rest of your life. Come live with me,' "" Day said. ""She didn't want to do that. She wants to stand on her own two feet. I could see the benefit of her going back home and getting stuck back into
work mentally and physically, resuming her normal life. Once you go from working so hard to doing nothing, it kind
of deteriorates you.""
Dening Day, who works as an administrative assistant at an import-export company, is a stubborn fighter who
survived physical and emotional abuse from her late husband. She obviously is not the deteriorating type.
Without Dening Day, you see, there is no Jason Day as we know him today. There are no tens of millions of dollars
in the bank, no 10 PGA Tour wins, including the 2015 PGA Championship.
She not only gave Jason life, she saved his life.
There surely are many mothers of PGA Tour players competing at TPC Sawgrass on Sunday deserving of kudos
and credit for the things they've done for their sons, but none may be more deserving of salutation than Dening,
whose sacrifices when Jason was a teenager are remarkable.
Dening, who grew up poor in the Philippines and was a mail-order bride whom Jason's physically-abusive, alcoholic
father, Alvyn, brought to Australia, set a chain reaction of events in motion that allowed Jason to pursue his golf
dreams and make an unimaginably good life for himself.
Jason once revealed of his father's abuse, ""Dad tried to drive me with the driver. Nothing was ever good enough,
even winning.""
After Alvyn Day died when Jason was 12, Jason tumbled into a derelict life of drinking and trouble-making, and
Dening desperately tried to change his path. She did so by selling the family home so she could afford to send
Jason to Kooralbyn, a golf academy, where he could find some discipline and direction.
It was there where Jason met Colin Swatton, his golf instructor, and his life changed forever. Swatton, who became
a father figure and confidant to Jason, caddies for him now.
Asked if, at the time, he had any idea just how deep the sacrifice his mother made when she sold the house so she
could send him to Kooralbyn, Jason said, ""I didn't at first, but I did after I had my first fight with Col. It was then
when I realized the sacrifice her and my sisters were making.
""I didn't really understand it until I was walking a par-3 golf course by myself one day after my fight with Col.""
Jason disrespected Swatton, insisting on playing the par-3 course at the academy instead of working on his short
game with the rest of the students.
""I made a fool of myself, played the par-3 in the end, but then came back and apologized,"" Jason recalled.
That day, early in Jason's time at the academy, was a turning point. It was when the depth of his mother's
sacrifices sunk in for him and when he began to respect Swatton.
If Dening doesn't sell her house, Jason never gets to that academy and Swatton never comes into his life.
""If my dad hadn't have passed away, I would have definitely never met Col,"" Jason said. ""And if I didn't meet Col, I
wouldn't be here today. It was all due to the fact that my mum sacrificed for me. To have practically nothing after
my dad died and for her to gamble on me to have the opportunity of sending me to the golf academy, that's a pretty
big risk.""
It was a risk that paid more dividends than even the most outlandish dreamers could have imagined."

Bank of America,Pile of cash burning a hole in the US pocket," May 11, 2017",1,"I have a prediction.
By this time next year, Congress will still be debating tax reform even as the US economy continues to suffer
through the slowest recovery in modern history.
Come December, we will ""celebrate"" the 10th anniversary of the start of the last official recession in this country.
That recession may have technically ended 19 months later, in June 2009, but it certainly has had lingering effects.
Say what you want about the Russians interfering in the last election or Hillary Clinton being a bad presidential
candidate or Donald Trump stirring up some crazy fire in the American electorate - but the presidential election last
year was basically lost by the Democrats because of the economy.
Incumbent parties don't win when an economy is growing below 2 percent quarter after quarter.
And while the Republicans and the Democrats are teasing each other about who won and who lost the last
argument on Capitol Hill - and coming up with the same old poor ideas for economic stimulus and tax reform -
those subpar quarters are piling up.
That's why I am going to offer my suggestion for economic growth once again. It requires only two changes in the
tax law, not the hundreds now being considered that will never be agreed upon. And my plan doesn't do things that
may lead to worse financial trouble for this country.
But wait, there's more.
My plan also will not add a dime to the US debt - in fact, it will cause debt and the deficit to decline, although
admittedly, not by a lot until the economy picks up and tax revenues increase.
I recently spoke with someone with considerable influence in the Democratic Party and we came up with a name
for this plan: the Willie Sutton School of Economics.
Why Willie Sutton? Because he was a bank robber who, when asked why he chose to make unauthorized
withdrawals from financial institutions, explained simply: ""Because that's where the money is.""
So, where is the money that could be used to help the US economy? Right now, there is an estimated $25 trillion
invested in retirement accounts, mostly in IRAs, 401k plans, Keoghs and the like. And that amount has risen
tremendously over the past few years because of the stock market's inexplicable rise.
America needs to unlock this big ol' pile of cash. Some tax rules will have to be changed.
Right now, folks who withdraw retirement money before they are 59 /[2] years old will be hit with a stiff penalty.
And that's on top of whatever regular and capital gains taxes are due. Quite a roadblock, I'd say.
In other words, much of that $25 trillion is going to sit in some brokerage account - maybe growing, maybe declining - until the owner of the account turns a lot older.
Willie Sutton wouldn't like money just sitting idly around like that - not when it could be used to help the country's
economy.
So what can be done? Here's the Willie Sutton plan:
n Congress and the White House change the tax laws so that owners of retirement savings could use some of the
money in their accounts today. Not a lot - some.
n Waive the 10 percent penalty on early withdrawals. Regular taxes would still apply - which would bring in extra
cash to the US Treasury.
n Allow folks to use the retirement cash to buy houses. Allowing people to diversify their retirement money into
something like a second home or a bigger home or a first home would help the real estate industry and all the
other industries that rely on it.
Besides, why are people now allowed to invest their retirement money in other people's real estate projects - via
REITs - but not in their own personal real estate?
Hey, if Republican and the Democratic lawmakers want to tweak this, they can be my guest. Just don't let them
come to me humming any childish tunes. This is grown-up stuff.
People might also be permitted to withdraw some cash to invest in a new business, whether it's their own or
someone else's. That, too, would create jobs and help the economy.
There would be restrictions on how much can be withdrawn and how it can be used, but the emphasis would be on
things that directly help the economy and put people back to work.
There's another pile of money that President Trump has already identified - and which I've written about a number
of times over the years. That consists of profits US companies are keeping overseas because they're trying to
avoid our high taxes.
Trump has proposed that companies be allowed to bring the money back to the US - ""repatriate"" it, as they say - at
a one-time tax rate that he hasn't yet determined.
That's fine. But as I've said in other columns, doing it this way will result in companies using that money to buy
back stock to enrich their executives. There needs to be an ironclad contract that forces companies to use the
repatriated cash to expand the company's business - thus helping the economy and creating jobs.
If a company breaks the contract, it will have to pay a higher tax rate retroactively.
It should take politicians 30 days to get the Willie Sutton plan done. Wall Street will complain for sure. The
Democrats will say this is another way to help ""rich"" people with retirement accounts.
But there's going to be a lot more bickering than that on the current tax reform package. And in the end, whatever
passes will look nothing like what the Republicans had hoped.
And the economy will still be huffing and puffing."

No more 'Core'
Common Core is an unmitigated disaster (""New York's Rx for Smarter Kids,"" Editorial, May 4). It was written largely
by non-educators who had no knowledge or expertise in child development. It's the continued overreach of the
federal government into education.
The standards, tied to such large educational companies as Pearson, which have made millions upon millions of
dollars on the testing material, do nothing to make students college-ready. And those who support such standards
assume all students learn the same and should be at the same educational level come the end of the 12th grade.
Common Core is detrimental to all children in America. It's a form of child abuse, and the time has long since
passed for it to be scrapped. It's what's best for New York students, their parents and society in general.

Bank of America,What prez should tell Abbas," May 3, 2017",1,"Because President Trump is a man in a hurry, here's how he can save time today when he welcomes Palestinian
President Mahmoud Abbas to the White House.
After the briefest of pleasantries, Trump can say, ""Mr. Abbas, your people should be preparing to celebrate the 17th
anniversary of the creation of their own state. But Yasser Arafat foolishly refused to recognize Israel's right to exist
at Camp David in 2000, so there was no deal, and history marched on without a Palestinian state.
""That was a mistake you can rectify right here, right now,"" Trump continues. ""I ask you, President Abbas, are you
ready to recognize Israel as the Jewish homeland, renounce violence against it and negotiate peaceful, secure
borders for two states?""
It is a yes-or-no question. If Abbas won't say yes, the answer is no - and there is nothing more to discuss. Trump
can spend his windfall of free time on issues more likely to bring results.
It has been said that hope is a good breakfast but a poor supper, and it is very late in the day to hope that Abbas
will be something he has never been. Now 82, in the 12th year of the four-year term he was elected to in 2005,
Abbas has not been honest about his endgame.
Sure, he wants a Palestinian state - as long as it gets handed to him by the United Nations or Washington. If
getting one means recognizing Israel and making fundamental concessions, he'll pass.
He'll pass in part for the same reason Arafat could never get to yes: Signing his name to a deal that accepts Israel's
right to exist could be signing his own death warrant. Jew hatred is a powerful force in Palestinian politics and
culture, and it is enforced ruthlessly by the gun.
In that sense, little has changed since Arafat walked away from the offer made by Israel and brokered by Bill
Clinton 17 years ago. The only difference is that time and developments, including some Israeli settlements, have
weakened the Palestinian negotiating position.
The rise of Islamic State, Hamas' control of the Gaza Strip, Hezbollah's growing strength in Lebanon and the
endless Syrian civil war have combined to surround Israel with more powerful enemies bent on its destruction.
Having voluntarily ceded Gaza and parts of southern Lebanon, only to get attacked on both borders, Israel will not
make the same mistake a third time in the West Bank.
Hopefully, Trump also understands that Barack Obama actually hardened the Palestinian-Israeli divide. Obama
took office with the misguided idea that putting daylight between the US and Israel would make a deal more likely
and bring peace to the whole region.
Fueled by the left's catechism that Israel is the problem, Obama's theory was that the Palestinians would trust him
enough to make concessions, and that Israel would be frightened into making a deal knowing the terms would only
get worse. He also thought a Palestinian-Israeli deal would magically resolve other conflicts.
Obama was wrong on all counts. Spectacularly so.
Even worse, his Iran deal gave the mad mullahs $150 billion and the green light to fund armed aggression
throughout the Mideast. Iran's continuing threats to wipe Israel off the map captures the insanity of Obama's
kumbaya fantasies.
Israel's reaction to all the mayhem is both sensible and predictable: It will make no deal that will bring more lethal forms of terrorism into the West Bank.
Indeed, during the last war with Hamas in Gaza amid the rise of Islamic State, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
declared that he could not foresee Israel withdrawing its security forces from the West Bank, lest it become a
larger Gaza, with terror tunnels honeycombing most of Israel.
The changing dynamics have made Abbas something of a bit player and reduced his leverage. Hamas smells its
rival's weakness, which is why it is trying to soften its image without giving up its founding vow to eliminate Israel.
Although those harsh realities should convince Trump of the limits of American involvement, there is one thing he
can and should do: hold Abbas accountable for attacks against Israelis and public incitement of terrorism.
The Palestinian government, which counts on foreign aid for virtually all of its money, pays salaries to prisoners
convicted of murder and other crimes and makes payments to the families of Arab ""martyrs"" who died in terror
attacks.
Trump can tell Abbas that America's contribution, which the Times of Israel says amounted to $712 million last
year, will be reduced every time there is a stabbing, a vehicle attack or a shooting by a Palestinian. Ditto for
rewarding terrorists' families and celebrating attackers by naming public buildings and plazas after them - all of it
must stop immediately.
If nothing else, Abbas would be shocked into realizing he's no longer dealing with Obama or George W. Bush. That
alone would be worth the few minutes it would take Trump to deliver the message that, this time, America really
does have Israel's back."
Bank of America,"CHECKING IN: KINGSMILL Williamsburg, Va."," May 2, 2017",1,"WHEN your daughter is 8 years old and learning about 18th-century America under British rule, there are few
excuses not to go to Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia. That's why we planned a three-night visit to the historic
town 120 miles from Washington, DC, where she could dine at the same taverns as Thomas Jefferson and George
Washington and skip through the streets rolling a hula hoop like a child from 300 years ago.
We stayed at the ultra kid-friendly Kingsmill Resort, just 5 miles from the faux blacksmiths and tricorner hats of
Williamsburg's historic center.
WHERE Set among 2,900 protected acres along the banks of the mighty James River, the leafy condominium hotel
occupies land that used to be a plantation.
It offers easy access not only to Williamsburg but also other colonial gems such as Jamestown Settlement
(America's first permanent English colony) and Yorktown Victory Center (the site where Washington's troops finally
defeated the British).
WHY The hotel's laidback atmosphere is great for unwinding after days of historic sightseeing. The four of us
stayed in a spacious one-bedroom condo, complete with sofa bed and washer/dryer, overlooking the river. Our pad
was one of 425 similar guest rooms and apartments in the sprawling complex.
WORKING WELL We were spoiled for choice, thanks to the two golf courses, 15 tennis courts, a full-service spa and
a kids' camp that operates throughout the summer starting June 12 and on holidays such as spring break and
Christmas. Other activities include cycling, fishing, excursions from the marina - where you can hire kayaks and
sea cycles for river jaunts - and 90-minute Segway tours.
Open between Memorial Day and Labor Day, there's a crowd-pleasing lazy river as well as a water slide, a fire pit
and an adjacent bar.
MUST TRY The highlight of our visit to the area was Go Ape (GoApe.com), an outdoor adventure experience a 15-
minute drive from Kingsmill. The quirky outfit is a zip line and obstacle course high in the trees.

Bank of America,Bank breakup remark jolts Wall St.," May 2, 2017",1,"An otherwise uneventful trading day on Wall Street on Monday got a middle-of-the-day scare when an off-the-cuff
remark by President Trump about breaking up the banks sent markets gyrating for about 14 minutes - before
investors figured it was no big deal.
In an interview at the Oval Office, Trump told Bloomberg News that he was ""looking into"" reviving the Glass-
Steagall Act, a law that kept separate commercial and investment banks.
A revival of Glass-Steagall, which he described as ""the old system,"" has been a feature of Trump's agenda since at
least August, when it was on the Republican Party's platform, and has been discussed by high-level White House
surrogates.
When Bloomberg's ultra-fast headline wire service reported the story, however, that nuance was lost: ""TRUMP
SAYS HE'S ACTIVELY CONSIDERING BREAKING UP BIG BANKS,"" the wire reported at 12:51 p.m.
Immediately, JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US bank by assets, took a nosedive, falling more than 1 percent in 2
minutes. Shares of Bank of America and other banks had similar reactions.
The revival of the Glass-Steagall act is one of the few bipartisan pieces of Trump's agenda.
The regulation was dismantled in 1999 after the merger of Citibank and Traveler's Insurance.
Even notorious Wall Street critic Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) introduced a ""21st Century"" version of the bill in
the Senate this year, along with John McCain (R-Ariz.)
""My fantasy is to break up the big banks,"" billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin said at a financial conference
in Beverly Hills on Monday.
Ty Trippet, a spokesman for Bloomberg, said the news outlet stands by its story."
Bank of America,$99M bye-bye bonus C-suite 'Berns' out," May 2, 2017",0,"Here's $99 million. Now get out.
In a surprise move that left Wall Street flummoxed, AllianceBernstein on Monday ousted Chairman and Chief
Executive Peter Kraus, who had led the firm for eight years.
Axa Financial, the French insurance giant that owns the institutional money manager, also reshuffled the AB board,
axing all nine members and appointing six new ones.
The money management firm didn't provide a clear reason for the shake-up, but in securities filings it revealed that
Kraus - a former Goldman Sachs exec who led AB for eight years - was getting a $99.3 million payout.
Axa, which has a 63.8 percent stake in AB, said JPMorgan Chase alum Seth Bernstein will be replacing Kraus as
CEO. Former World Bank president Robert Zoellick was named chairman.
""In an industry that is confronting significant shifts, we need to continue transforming the business to improve the
quality of our investment solutions while delivering our services more effectively,"" Axa's Denis Duverne said in a
statement.
Analysts weren't buying Duverne's sound bites, amid signs that he had been quietly moving to replace him for at
least several weeks.
""There is little news other than the changes did not reflect strategic or financial issues - suggesting to us,
potentially personal conflict drove the sudden change,"" Citigroup analyst William Katz wrote in a note Monday.
Duverne claimed that the decision was motivated in part by it being ""eight years in a row, for Peter.""
AB, with roughly $500 million in assets under management, reported first quarter results last week and they
certainly weren't stellar. Revenue, operating income and operating margin were all down from last year.
AB's shares were also nothing to write home about - falling 5.7 percent over the past 12 months, trailing rivals.
Before too many tears are shed for Kraus, it should be noted the now-unemployed CEO will soon be getting that
$99.3 million check as Axa buys back his 4.5 percent AB stake.
It is the second time Kraus was handsomely rewarded while being shown the door. The former longtime Goldman
Sachs executive earned $30 million from Merrill Lynch after spending just three months as head of strategy there
in 2008, scoring a golden parachute right before Merrill was sold to Bank of America.
Shares of AB closed down 3.2 percent, at $22.15."
Bank of America,Wells Slugfest 15 on board spared as shareholders cry foul," Apr 26, 2017",1,"There's a holdup on the stagecoach!
Chaos erupted during Wells Fargo's annual meeting on Tuesday as angry shareholders refused to sit down and
shut up over the board's responsibility for the fake-accounts scandal that has tainted the bank's reputation.
In the end, all of the bank's 15 board members retained their jobs. The vote was a remarkable show of the different
standards held by investors like billionaire Warren Buffett - the bank's largest shareholder who was said to have
voted to keep the board intact - and smaller ones who demanded more accountability.
Still, while Chief Executive Tim Sloan and two other recently elected members got 99 percent of the vote, one
director received just 53 percent, and none of the other dozen got more than 80 percent, Wells Fargo said.
Corporate-governance experts say directors with less than 80 percent of the vote should consider stepping down.
""That's extremely low,"" Dick Bove, analyst at Rafferty Capital Markets, told The Post.
Chairman Stephen Sanger, who only got 56 percent of votes cast, called the blistering results a ""clear message of
dissatisfaction."" Long-serving directors Enrique Hernandez Jr., Cynthia H. Milligan and Federico F. Pea all got less
than 60 percent of the vote.
During the first minutes of the meeting, a shareholder spurred mayhem as he demanded that board members
stand up and tell investors what they knew and when they knew it about the scandal, which led to the bank's
ouster of its previous CEO, John Stumpf.
""Let them speak! Let them speak! Or are they just mouthpieces for the executives who allowed these predatory
practices to occur?"" said Bruce Marks of the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America.
Sanger tried to get Marks to sit down and wait until a specific Q&A session, telling him he was ""out of order."" But
for nearly 10 minutes the shareholder refused to follow the rules of the board meeting.
""Wells Fargo has been out of order for years, and your response is, 'Well, we're sorry,' "" Marks yelled. ""Well, that's
not good enough!""
Sanger, in what may be an unprecedented move for a major bank, then recessed the meeting briefly and kicked out
Marks.
Nevertheless, after the meeting was reconvened, other shareholders stood up to hijack it.
""We elected you to protect us!"" one shareholder, Fred Hornbuckle, said.
Bove said the disruptions were reminiscent of the antics of Evelyn Davis, a notorious gadfly who rankled CEOs at
annual meetings for decades.
""Everybody gets to piss on management, which the American public wants to see,"" but the board walks away
effectively unscathed, Bove said. ""They blew their tops, they screamed, but nobody cares.""
The nearly three-hour meeting was the first since the bank settled last year with government regulators after the
bank fired 5,300 employees for creating at least 2.1 million fake accounts in customers' names.
Held in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., the meeting was the first major test for the board, 80 percent of which proxy
adviser ISS said deserved the boot."
Bank of America,Talk about glee! Universal Music Group worth $22B," Apr 26, 2017",0,"Talk about a change of tune.
Vivendi's Universal Music Group, the world's biggest music label, is worth a stunning $22 billion, the French owner of the label said Tuesday.
Most on Wall Street had pegged the value of Universal, home to Selena Gomez, U2, Drake and Lady Gaga, among
many others, at closer to $13 billion.
But Universal's sales have been improving and a music industry tracker confirmed on Tuesday that total worldwide
music revenue, aided by a rapid rise in streaming, leaped by 6 percent in 2016, to $15.7 billion.
Vivendi, the Paris-based media conglomerate that owns stakes in pay-TV and telecom firms across Europe, has
been under pressure to spin off at least a piece of UMG.
Vivendi's estimate of UMG's value came from investment bankers' estimates of the label value.
No banker has been hired to undertake an initial public offering, however.
The last major label to be acquired was Warner Music Group in 2012. It cost owner Len Blavatnik $3.3 billion.
Around that time, UMG paid $1.9 billion for EMI's recorded music business. Sony paid $2.2 billion for EMI's
publishing business.
Vivendi held its annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday and the company's chairman and controlling shareholder,
Vincent Bollor, gave word about the new eye-popping valuation.
Vivendi General Counsel Frdric Crpin revealed the firm had received an offer of $8.5 billion in 2013, reportedly from
SoftBank. Crpin said it had also received an offer of $15 billion in 2015. Liberty Media was rumored to be circling at
that time.
UMG's profits before interest, taxes and amortization grew 8.4 percent in 2016 on a 3.1 percent rise in revenue.
Back in October, Bank of America analyst Daniel Kerven told investors in a note: ""It would be hard to conceive a
better story - a transformed product that drives a multiple of revenue from a very low base after 20 years of
disruption, whose take up is being paid for, subsidized by telco and internet companies."""
Bank of America,Shooting Blanks Goldman's wimpy Q1 pushes shares off cliff," Apr 19, 2017",0,"Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein has delivered a clunker.
The white-shoe investment bank posted disappointing earnings for the first quarter, with trading revenue -
traditionally the bank's big moneymaker - ceding ground to rivals with less-fancy names.
Despite easy comparisons with last year's abysmal first quarter, when stocks and bonds had slumped amid
corporate skittishness over the economy, Goldman on Tuesday reported $1.69 billion in revenue from trading in
bonds, currencies and commodities - a paltry 1-percent increase.
The results were ""a shock,"" wrote Dick Bove, an analyst at Rafferty Capital Markets, in a note.
""None of this company's competitors have fared this poorly in the first quarter,"" he added.
Goldman's stock got hammered on the disappointing news, falling 4.7 percent, to $215.59, its lowest close since
late November.
That shaved off $4.5 billion in market capitalization by the end of the day, making Tuesday the biggest single-day
selloff since June 24, the day after Britain voted to leave the European Union.
Weak trading income plagued a period that had seemed tailored to boost Goldman Sachs' profit: Donald Trump
had come into office stacked with at least half a dozen Goldman alumni (including longtime No. 2 Gary Cohn), the
Federal Reserve was hiking interest rates and bankers sold the ""Trump trade"" to willing investors who were finally
ready to buy again.
""Ultimately, we didn't navigate the market well, but no quarter defines the franchise,"" Marty Chavez, Goldman's
incoming chief financial officer, said during an analyst phone call.
He suggested that unusually calm markets were responsible for the slowdown in trading for the first three months
of 2017. But that didn't seem to have the same impact on Goldman's rivals.
In the quarter, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America all posted significant increases in revenue from
trading in bonds, currencies and commodities. JPMorgan posted a 17-percent uptick in revenue.
Citi's rose 19 percent, and BofA's grew nearly 17 percent - versus Goldman's 1-percent gain.
It's not exactly clear why Goldman stumbled while the other banks soared, though its reliance on hedge funds and
junk bonds - which both lagged last quarter - may have had something to do with it, Bloomberg News reported.
Overall, Goldman posted $2.26 billion in profit, or $5.15 a share, which was a 99 percent increase from last year's
weak first quarter.
Analysts had expected about $5.31 a share.
The earnings add insult to injury for Goldman, which struggled last year to define itself against its peers amid a
vastly changing Wall Street landscape, where trading is largely being executed by computer programs and cost
cutting has been the most reliable way to post profits.
Separately on Tuesday, Bank of America posted better-than-expected profits of $4.86 billion, or 41 cents a share -
up 44 percent, in part from an increase in trading revenue.

[online brokerage] TD Ameritrade.
I have been investing with this company for a long time. Most dealings have been fine until this. Let me fill you in:
On March 8, 2016, I purchased 1,000 shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals at $66.05 per share
On March 14, 2016, I placed an order to sell 1,000 shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals at $66.50 per share.
On March 15, 2016, at 6:18 a.m., I phoned TD Ameritrade and was told Valeant Pharmaceuticals had dropped to
$53.50 per share. I did not sell because my order to sell was $66.50. Somewhere before the stock hit the $53.50
level it had to have hit or passed my sell number.
I am an 82-year-old widow who recently lost my oldest son and feel I have no one to help me anymore. I need help.
For this reason John, I have reached out to you. I am a reader of your column and I know how helpful you have
been to many people and I feel strongly you will be able to help me.
Thank you so much for your time and effort. J.O.
Dear J.O.: First things first. I'm very sorry to hear about your son's death. And I've been working on your problem for
a couple of weeks. This is what I got.
TD Ameritrade isn't going to confess anything to me - and they won't even tell me much. Therefore, we have to go
to option 2: outside help, without hiring an expensive attorney.
TD Ameritrade has apparently ruled against you - not surprising - and you will get nowhere contacting the
company. Your agreement with TD Ameritrade states that any problems need to be brought to arbitration.
I know that because that's what all brokerage agreements state.
So I suggest that you file a complaint against the company with:
Finra Investor Complaint Center
9509 Key West Ave.
Rockville, MD 20850-3329 Phone: (240) 386-HELP (4357)
Fax: (866) 397-3290
Your complaint will go to arbitration, where the odds will also be stacked against you. But at least Finra - which
stands for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority - will pretend to be sympathetic. Good luck.
Dear John, My secretary of many years and I parted company. Several years ago, she was added as backup
signatory on my personal checking account.
To remove her from signature power on this account takes more than a yeoman's effort.
After one hour in a Bank of America branch it was suggested that I close the account, which has my complete
history of banking for 25 years. I declined to do that.
After a telephone conference with a BofA 800 number, it was promised by BofA that it would send me a form that I
and my former secretary would have to sign and have it notarized separately.
This is the only way BofA will remove her from my account. No form ever arrived by mail. Can you assist? R.S.
Dear R.S.: I contacted Bank of America for you and the form is on its way.
""To remove an owner from a personal account, which would include anyone with signature power on the account,
both parties need to be present at one of our financial centers,"" said a bank spokesperson.
""If that is not possible, we will mail the form, which will need to be signed by the person being removed from the
account and notarized.""
I hope you and your ""secretary of many years"" parted company on good terms.
Debt may easily hit a quadrillion
Dear John, Does anyone know what comes after a trillion? It's a quadrillion and our national debt is headed there
quickly unless we

Dear R.L.: Does anyone know what compounded interest is? It's the interest on top of interest in our nation's debt
and it is going to get us to a quadrillion faster than we know.
Dear John: The best argument for President Trump started years ago at the skating rink, when he was able to
essentially eliminate government waste in money and time.
Regarding lowering deficits, why are the potential savings from every area of government not talked much about?
Once again, thank you for your ongoing thoughts. K.L.
Dear K.L.: I'm rooting for President Trump. I hope he can cut government waste and reduce the Federal budget
deficit.
At the very least, I'd like to see him cut waste and use the savings more productively to help the economy and US
citizens.
But a skating rink isn't the Federal bureaucracy, which is far more slippery."

Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises large owners of stock - like mutual funds and hedge funds - how
to vote on crucial corporate issues, said Friday that Wells Fargo shareholders should vote out 80 percent of the
company's board of directors.
Twelve of the banks 15 board candidates should get the thumbs-down for their ""failures"" to prevent the San
Francisco-based bank's disastrous fake-accounts scandal, ISS said in an explosive report.
The 12 directors targeted by ISS oversaw committees that were in a position to stop the bank from opening
millions of fake accounts and credit cards in order to boost sales numbers for five years, ISS said.
The revelations, which came to light in a $185 million settlement last year, led to the ouster of the bank's last CEO, John Stumpf in October.
""The Audit and Examination, Risk, and Human Resources Committees, tasked with risk oversight, failed over a
number of years to provide a timely and sufficient risk oversight process that should have mitigated the harmful
impact of the unsound retail banking sales practices that occurred from 2011-2016,"" ISS said in its report.
""Votes against 12 directors and members of the committees are warranted for the committees' failures in this
regard.""

Sloan, and two other directors who joined this year: Karen Peetz, a former president of BNY Mellon, and Ronald
Sargent, a former CEO of Staples.
Wells Fargo blasted the ISS recommendations, calling them ""extreme and unprecedented.""
""The ISS report was also issued without taking into account findings of the Board's independent investigation,
which was launched last September and will be made public shortly,"" the company said.
ISS' recommendations are significantly harsher than those of Glass Lewis, a rival proxy advisory.
Glass Lewis recommended that six directors lose their jobs.
It's rare for proxy firms to recommend that boards get rid of any director, much less whole groups of them.
While it's no guarantee that shareholders will oust the board, CEOs pay attention - and often lash out - when
proxies make recommendations counter to what the board wants.
""God knows how any of you can place your vote based on ISS or Glass Lewis,"" Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's
CEO said in 2015 when the proxy firms recommended splitting the bank's CEO and chairman roles."
Bank of America,First 100 days Prez's Mideast peace push," Apr 6, 2017",1,"President Trump met with King Abdullah II of Jordan at the White House Wednesday as a report revealed that the
administration wants to host a Mideast summit between Israel and the Palestinians as soon as this summer.
The two leaders, Trump said, would ""advance the cause of peace in the Middle East, including peace between the
Israelis and the Palestinians, and I'm working very, very hard when trying to finally create peace between the
Palestinians and Israel.""
The president also praised Jordan, a US ally, for joining the fight against ISIS.
The Jordanian king returned the praise and said he was hopeful that the Trump administration could get action in
solving the Middle East's many problems.
""I think your message is a message of hope,"" Abdullah said.
The meeting followed a White House sitdown on Monday between Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-
Sissi during which they discussed holding the summit in Washington, the London-based Arab newspaper Al-Hayat
reported.
""I know your importance and the centrality of your regional role, and I want to cooperate and work together,"" the
newspaper reported Trump telling el-Sissi, citing sources.
Trump added that he would take a ""completely different"" approach than his predecessor in seeking a peace
agreement.
Trump, according to the source, told el-Sissi that Barack Obama saw Egypt as being ""part of the problem,"" while he
himself viewed ""it as part of the solution.""
Quoting Alaa Yousef, a spokesman for el-Sissi, the report said the Egyptian leader stressed the important role
America would play in reviving the peace process between the Palestinians and the Israelis.
The two leaders agreed to ""activate the mechanism of strategic dialogue between the two countries in order to
promote mutual understanding and develop cooperation in all fields,"" Yousef told the newspaper.
Jason Greenblatt, Trump's special representative for international negotiations, raised the idea of reviving peace talks to other Arab leaders last week, and the matter came up again when Trump met with Abdullah.
Leaders at the annual Arab League summit last week in Jordan reached an agreement on recognizing Israel in
exchange for a Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem.
With the agreement to back his case, Abdullah told Trump that Arab leaders are serious about achieving what
Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, described as the ""historic reconciliation between Israel and the whole
Arab world,"" USA Today reported.
The president did not reveal his goals for such a summit.
Previously, Trump said he would favor either a one-state or two-state solution as long as both sides agreed.

Bank of America,Granny's hedge Funds flock to 'risky' bank stocks," Apr 6, 2017",0,"Come on, hedgies - you call bank stocks an alternative investment?
Hedge funds' exposure to bank stocks hit record levels at the start of 2017, but many may have piled into the trade
too late.
Hedge funds had 5.1 percent - or $33 billion - of their portfolios invested in financial institutions at the start of the
year, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report released Wednesday.
Both figures were record highs since Bank of America started tracking such data in 2005.
Among the hedge funds buying into the enthusiasm was Dan Loeb's Third Point, which holds Bank of America and
JPMorgan Chase.
""On November 8th, our financials portfolio was 4.4 percent of the fund. One day later, it was 6 percent, one week
later, 10.5 percent; one month later, 11.8 percent,"" Loeb wrote in a February letter to investors.
Other banks favored by hedge funds are Citigroup and Wells Fargo.
Most bank stocks rallied immediately following the November election on expectations of a more Wall Streetfriendly,
regulation-light administration. The early buyers were quickly rewarded, but laggards may have lost.
While the KBW bank index is up 15 percent since the election, it is down 1.3 percent this year.
Even worse, hedge funds may have missed what is looking like the better play for 2017.
As funds money poured into financials, it was pulled out of technology, with financial weights growing by 2 percent
and technology falling by 4.1 percent, the Bank of America report said. The broader financial industry is up only 1.7 percent year to date, while technology has soared 10.2 percent, with
hedgie favorites like Apple and Facebook up more than 20 percent."
Bank of America,"IS NY STILL RULED BY ROCKEFELLERS? With the passing of a patriarch, a great dynasty's power fades"," Apr 2, 2017",1,"WHEN David Rockefeller Sr. died March 20, at the age of 101, he was worth $3.3 billion, according to Forbes. And
with his passing, the city lost one of the last of its brand-name billionaires.
The Rockefeller name has long captured the American imagination, becoming shorthand for ""richest of the rich.""
For more than a century, the family has ranked among the most important clans in New York. It is no
understatement to say they helped build this town. Their moniker is stamped all over local institutions - Rockefeller
Center, Rockefeller Fountain, Rockefeller University for medical sciences. A Rockefeller co-founded the Museum of
Modern Art. Family members have also helped fund everything from the YMCA to the Asia Society and have driven
the development of projects such as Battery Park City.
There was a time when having a Rockefeller at an event could elevate an up-and-coming hostess. ""They were the
most desirable guests,"" says a source who knows that world well. ""It could cement a person's place in society.""
So what does it mean to be a Rockefeller today, when few New Yorkers would be able to name members of the
current generations?
""The name still means a lot,"" said Michael Gross, editor of Avenue magazine. ""But they have collective power, not
individual power.""
THE family's money was first earned by John D. Rockefeller - David's grandfather - who founded Standard Oil in
1870, and was America's first billionaire. ""[He] is the quintessential robber baron,"" Gross said.
Indeed, despite all the good he did for early-20th century Manhattan, John D. operated as a brutal businessman.
""[He was] no angel,"" said David Nasaw, who's written about America's great dynasties. ""You make his kind of
money by driving hard bargains, destroying competitors and paying the lowest wages.""
It all fostered the luxurious lifestyles of family members. David and his siblings - including brothers who grew up to
be the governors of New York and Arkansas, as well as one of America's first venture capitalists - could've inspired
the comic-book character Richie Rich with their over-the-top childhoods. When David skated down Fifth Avenue, a limousine rolled behind him in case he got too tired. He grew up in Manhattan's largest private residence and
summered at a 107-room ""beach cottage"" in Seal Harbor, Maine.
When con artist and murderer Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter wanted to pass himself off as a wealthy heir in the
1990s, he renamed himself Clark Rockefeller. During the same decade, a striving Jay Z launched the Roc-A-Fella
Records label - sending a clear message about his hip-hop ambitions.
In our collective imagination, ""Rockefeller"" has come to stand for massive yachts, buckets of diamonds and
flowing champagne. But the family never flaunted its wealth. John D. Rockefeller Jr. was even squeamish about
putting his name on Rockefeller Center. ""He thought it 'flamboyant and distasteful,' "" wrote Dan Okrent in his book
""Great Fortune,"" ""but the prospect of empty buildings was distasteful, too."" And he knew putting the family stamp
on it would attract tenants eager for a bit of that success to rub off on them, too.
Yet some in New York society say the family's power has been diluted a bit as they've grown in numbers and their
level of wealth has become increasingly common. In an age of tech billionaires and hedge-fund titans, America's
oldmoney families have struggled to keep up. The Vanderbilts, who built Grand Central Station, are ""wealthy but
not fabulously wealthy. The Carnegies are worth nothing [now],"" said Nasaw.
""The older Rockefeller generation did a lot to help New York,"" said a prominent Manhattan socialite. ""But the
younger generation is more spread out geographically and financially. They don't have the [financial] wherewithal
to do what their relatives did.""
There are Rockefellers in Montana, Vermont, even Arkansas, where Andrea D. Rockefeller, granddaughter of that
state's onetime governor Winthrop, is a cop. Divorces, remarriages and prolific numbers of children - living blooddescendents
of John D. Rockefeller exceed 150 - have divided the family fortune.
Today John D. Rockefeller's lifetime haul would be worth around $336 billion. But Forbes estimates that the
collective family bankroll hovers at around a thinly spread $11 billion. (David - who served as president of Chase
Bank - died with a personal fortune of $3.3 billion.)
A chunk of it has gone to philanthropy. John D. Rockefeller's ethos was, ""I believe that every right implies a
responsibility; every opportunity, an obligation; every possession, a duty."" He underscored this by giving away
$530,853,632. David donated some $900 million in his lifetime. Relatives today continue the tradition with
organizations such as Rockefeller Philanthropy, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.
""[High-profile philanthropy] is in their DNA,"" said another socialite. ""They have given funds to improve health care,
to foster international trade and to enliven the arts.""
But while there are family institutions, there is no money-making family business, per se. By contrast, the Hearst
family, with their active media holdings, continue to roll in the dough and are said to be worth $28 billion.
Robert Frank, who's chronicled the rich for The Wall Street Journal, has expressed doubt about the money lasting
through the current crop of Rockefellers. Sean O'Reilly, who has written extensively on the family, concurs: ""You
have five generations . . . start chopping up a billion dollars and it disappears.""
THE Rockefellers have largely been outshined, in terms of glamour and ostentatiousness, by West Coast dynasties
like the Hearsts and the Gettys. But that's not to say they haven't had scandal and tragedy.
When former New York governor Nelson Rockefeller passed away in 1979 of a heart attack, it was allegedly after
having made love to his secretary. Steven Rockefeller shocked everyone by marrying Anne-Marie Rasmussen, his
family's housemaid, in 1959. In 1951, Winifred Rockefeller, great-niece of John D. Rockefeller, killed herself and two
of her children inside their Greenwich, Conn., home.
Ten years later, in 1961, while hunting down art in New Guinea, 23-year-old Michael Rockefeller was supposedly
eaten by cannibals.
Lately, though, the name has been untarnished and those deep in the philanthropy scene said it still goes a long
way. ""When you have a Rockefeller on your committee it is a bonus,"" said a society chronicler. ""People want to
hobnob with them.""
Among the glittering lights on the gala circuit are several women who married into the family: Renee Rockefeller,
who is on the board of public art organization Creative Time and is the wife of Nelson's son Mark; Allison Rockefeller, who founded Audubon's Women in Conservation and is wed to Nelson's grandson Peter; and Susan
Rockefeller, who's on the board of Oceana and is married to David Jr.
Still, if finances keep eroding, one wonders what might become of NYC's most valuable name. Perhaps a relative
could take a stint on the ""Real Housewives,"" a la Sonja Morgan - whose ex-husband was an heir of Industrial Age
banking tycoon John Pierpont Morgan.
Gross admits it could happen. ""My hope, though,"" he said, ""would be that somebody in the family would stage an
intervention."""
Bank of America,"It's on with the shows at Times Sq.'s historic Hudson A long run of theatrics, early 'Tonight' shows, '70s porn &amp;amp; finally a rebirth"," Mar 29, 2017",0,"In the spring of 1912, Henry B. Harris and his wife went to London, looking for plays to produce for the Hudson
Theatre, the showpiece of his thriving Broadway empire. Built in 1903, the Greco-Roman jewel on West 44th Street
was one of the most sought-after theaters in Times Square.
For Henry and Renee Harris, who were childless, the Hudson was their pride and joy. They lived above the
auditorium in a 2,500-square-foot duplex apartment.
Sailing back to New York on April 14 on a spectacular new ocean liner, the couple was playing cards in their
stateroom when Renee noticed something odd: Clothes that had been swinging from their hangers suddenly
stopped.
Their ship was the Titanic, and it had just struck an iceberg.
Renee wanted to remain with Henry as the ship began listing. But he insisted she get into a lifeboat - the last one,
as it turned out. She gave him her jewels for safekeeping. An hour later, Henry, the jewels and the Titanic were on
their way to the bottom of the Atlantic.
For the next year, she was in mourning. But then she remembered something her husband had told her: ""You are a
better businessman than I am.""
And so Renee took over the Hudson Theatre, becoming Broadway's first female producer. Her string of hit shows
included ""The Noose,"" featuring a chorus girl named Barbara Stanwyck; ""Clarence,"" starring Alfred Lunt and Helen
Hayes; and ""Hot Chocolates,"" with Louis Armstrong.
She died in 1969, at age 93, but her theater survived. It narrowly dodged the wrecking ball several times and rode
through a series of reincarnations, including a radio studio, TV studio and porn house.
Today, Broadway's oldest theater is now its newest and, once again, one of its most beautiful. The Ambassador
Theatre Group (ATG), which leases the theater from the Millennium Hotel Group, spent tens of millions of dollars
restoring it to its original splendor. Last month, the Hudson reopened as a legitimate theater with ""Sunday in the
Park with George,"" starring Jake Gyllenhaal - it's the first show to grace its stage in nearly 50 years.
The modest four-story Renaissance facade gives ""few clues to the riches to be found inside the playhouse,""
Nicholas van Hoogstraten writes in his 1997 book, ""Lost Broadway Theatres.""
The Hudson's outstanding feature is the lobby's glass ceiling, designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany himself.
Restorers spent more than a year removing every piece of glass and cleaning it by hand. Today the ceiling glows.
More Tiffany designs are found inside the butterscotch-colored auditorium, which has 975 seats, all with ample
legroom. Tiffany tiles - pink, green and gold - line the boxes and the front of the balcony. In the 1950s, when the
theater was used as a TV studio, the mosaics were plastered over. Those that weren't ruined have been
painstakingly restored.
Under Renee's direction, the Hudson was so successful that, in 1929, a rival producer offered her $1 million for it.
She turned him down. Three years later, after the Wall Street stock-market crash, she was wiped out. She lost the
theater to the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank, which sold it to CBS for just $100,000.
Renee Harris remarried three times and faded into obscurity, cropping up from time to time whenever a reporter needed a quote from a Titanic survivor. She grew wary of the role, however. Nobody, she complained, ever wanted
to know about her career in the theater.
""You were on the Titanic?"" someone once asked her.
""Yes,"" Harris said.
""Were you saved?""
""No,"" she replied.
CBS used the Hudson as a radio studio in the '30s. A memento from its radio days was discovered during the
theater's renovation: a door, just behind the box office, marked ""Tex and Jinx Productions."" That was the company
owned by Tex McCrary and his wife, Jinx Falkenburg, a model and actress. In the '40s, they created and hosted
America's first talk-radio show.
Playwriting team Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse (""Life With Father"") took over the Hudson in 1943. Among the
theater's hits in the 1940s were ""Arsenic and Old Lace,"" ""Detective Story"" and Lindsay and Crouse's ""State of the
Union,"" which won the Pulitzer Prize.
In 1950, NBC bought the theater for $595,000 and turned it into a television studio for the ""Tonight"" show, first with
Steve Allen and then Jack Paar. It was on the stage of the Hudson that Elvis Presley sang ""Hound Dog"" to a real
hound dog wearing a top hat. A photo of that momentous event hangs in the theater's upstairs bar. Presley does
not look happy.
When ""Tonight"" decamped to 30 Rockefeller Plaza in 1959, NBC refurbished the Hudson - and discovered it had a
tenant.
Since 1942, a producer named Robert Breen had been living in the Harris' old apartment with his wife, Wilva, their
kids and a ragtag band of theater people. Breen paid very little rent, made his own repairs and had light and heat
only when the theater was in use. When it was empty, he used electric space heaters and the apartment's four
wood-burning fireplaces.
NBC, which needed the apartment for office space, tried to evict him, but Breen refused to leave. A court ruled in
his favor. After he died, his wife continued to live in the apartment, successfully battling every effort to evict her.
Up until the 1990s, members of the Breen family squatted in the apartment while running a small theater company.
The nine-room apartment is empty today but for two enormous marble claw bathtubs that the Harrises installed a
century ago. The tubs are too heavy to be removed.
As Times Square slid into sleaze in the 1960s and '70s, so, too, did the Hudson. It became a porno house. The
theater that once housed Lillian Hellman's ""Toys in the Attic"" was now showing ""Boys in the Attic.""
The situation grew more dire in the '80s, when the Hudson was nearly demolished at several points to make way
for a parking lot, then considered a more valuable use of space than a theater.
It was landmarked in 1987, then bought by real-estate mogul Harry Macklowe, who used it as a conference center
and banquet hall for his adjoining Macklowe Hotel.
Plans to turn the Hudson back into a legitimate theater never got off the ground until ATG took over the lease in
2015 and began renovating, turning it into the showpiece it is today.
Back in the '60s, when the Hudson was a porn house, a reporter reached out to Renee Harris for a comment.
""When I'm on 44th Street, I turn my back on the Hudson,"" she said. ""It's a movie house with sex pictures.""
She certainly wouldn't turn her back on her theater today."
Bank of America,Terminal cutters a headache for B'berg," Mar 29, 2017",1,"Bloomberg, the financial media giant selling $24,000-a-year terminals, saw sales of its ubiquitous black-and-orange
screens fall for the second time ever last year, according to a new industry report.
Terminal rentals declined by about 1 percent last year, to 324,485 worldwide, as banks downsized and cut the cord,
according to a report released Tuesday by Burton-Taylor International Consulting.
The 2016 decline in terminal sales was only the second time in the company's nearly 36-year history. The only
other down year was 2009, during the financial crisis.
Last year, The Post reported that JPMorgan and Bank of America, two of the company's biggest customers, were
looking to cut as many as 7,000 terminals during the next three years as part of larger budget overhauls.
Bloomberg is still the biggest player in the field - with more than a third of the entire market share. The next-biggest
company, Thomson Reuters, fell to 23 percent.
Despite the terminal drop-off, Bloomberg still managed to increase revenue by about 3.4 percent, to $9.2 billion - in
part because of a 10 percent spike in bankers buying raw data feeds.
It isn't clear how profitable Bloomberg is, since the company reports revenues but not costs.
One reason for the decline in terminal sales has to do with the terminal contracts, almost all of which are
denominated in US dollars, three sources in the company told The Post.
The US dollar has gained so much against others that in places like Brazil - where the value of their currency has
collapsed against the greenback since 2012 - terminals have effectively doubled in price from only a few years ago.
Ty Trippet, a spokesman for Bloomberg, declined to comment."
Bank of America,Rolling the dice NFL votes to let Raiders try their luck in Vegas," Mar 28, 2017",1,"PHOENIX - Vegas, baby!
NFL owners approved the Raiders' move from Oakland, Calif., to Las Vegas by a 31-1 vote Monday, sending one of the league's legendary franchises to the gambling capital of America. The Raiders are the third NFL team to move
in the last 14 months, following the Rams' and Chargers' exodus to Los Angeles.
""You know our goal is to have 32 stable franchises for each team and the league,"" commissioner Roger Goodell
said at the league meetings. ""We work very hard and never want to see the relocation of a franchise. We worked
tirelessly over the last nine months or so on a solution. We needed to provide certainties and stability for the
Raiders and the league.""
The move comes after years of the Raiders and the NFL pursuing a new stadium in Oakland. Instead, they found a
new stadium in Las Vegas, which offered $750 million in public money. The Bank of America also is giving Raiders
owner Mark Davis a $650 million loan, making Monday's vote an easy one for NFL owners. Dolphins owner Stephen
Ross was the only dissenting vote.
""My father used to say that the greatness of the Raiders is in its future, and the opportunity to build a world-class
stadium in the entertainment capital of the world is one opportunity that will give us the ability to achieve that
greatness,"" Davis said, invoking the memory of his famous father, Al Davis.
This is not the first time the Raiders have left Oakland. They played in Los Angeles from 1982-94 before returning
to the Bay Area.
Las Vegas has long been a taboo city for sports leagues, but that attitude clearly is changing. The NHL has the
expansion Golden Knights opening play this fall. An NFL spokesman confirmed people still will be able to bet on
Raiders games at Vegas sportsbooks after the team moves.
For the time being, the Raiders will stay in Oakland. Their lease at the Oakland Coliseum runs through 2018. Davis
said they may even stay through 2019. The Las Vegas stadium is not expected to be ready until the 2020 season.
Playing in front of fans who feel they are being abandoned will create an interesting atmosphere for the next few
years.
""I have mixed feelings, obviously,"" Davis said. ""I love Oakland. I love the fans in Oakland. I know there's going to be
disappointment and maybe some anger. I just hope that in the future, as we play in Oakland this year, that they
understand it wasn't the players, it wasn't the coaches that made this decision. It was me that made it. If they have
anybody to talk to about it, it should be me.""
Davis said he would spend the coming days and weeks trying to explain why he made this move with the
franchise.
The city of Oakland made a last-ditch effort to keep the Raiders, presenting a $1.3 billion plan for a stadium that
would be ready by 2021, but the NFL did not feel it was a viable option.
""You will never ever see me wearing anything that says the 'Raiders,' "" Oakland City Council President Larry Reid
told the Associated Press, saying he will consult with attorneys to see if the council can force the Raiders out of
the Coliseum early."
Bank of America,The soviet spy who loved usa I was the perfect KGB agent - until I fell for the enemy," Mar 26, 2017",0,"Jack Barsky kept his calm as he neared the traffic circle under the West Side Highway overpass. In his hand he
held a piece of chalk and furtively drew a straight horizontal line on the wall as he walked past.
If a pedestrian happened to notice it, they might think it a mark made by a kid, or perhaps nothing it all.
But when a certain undercover KGB operative spotted the chalk mark as he drove from his compound in The Bronx
to his cover job at the United Nations, he would inform his comrades, and they would know what it meant: Barsky
had reported for duty in New York City.
It was 1978, and the Cold War was in full effect. Barsky was a spy, illegally in the United States under a stolen
identity. One wrong move could put him at risk, perhaps even send him to prison for the rest of his life.
But, as he writes in his new book, ""Deep Under Cover: My Secret Life and Tangled Allegiances as a KGB Spy in
America"" (Tyndale Momentum), out now, the most dangerous thing of all happened: He fell in love with America.
The man who came to be known as Jack Barsky was born Albrecht Dittrich in 1949 in East Germany. One of his
earliest memories was listening to radio coverage of Josef Stalin's 1953 funeral and his father boasting, ""Comrade
Stalin was a great man.""
Dittrich joined the Communist party as a college student. His first encounter with the shadowy side of Communism
came in 1970, in the form of a knock on his dorm-room door. A mysterious man Dittrich assumed was from the
Stasi, the East German secret police, asked if he was interested in a government career. Intrigued, Dittrich said yes
- and days later found himself meeting with a KGB operative.
""At the time I was recruited, the Soviet Union was arguably at the height of its power,"" he writes. ""I had no problem
working for the Russians, because they were our big brother and they were leading [East Germany] to the promised
land.""
Dittrich entered a KGB training program with the intention that he would one day be embedded undercover in New
York. He studied American culture and mannerisms, and English lessons helped erase his accent. He learned how
to send and receive coded messages, as well as how to tell if he was being followed and how to set up ""dead
drops"" to exchange money and top-secret information with fellow agents.
A KGB agent already ensconced in the States combed over gravestones in a Maryland graveyard to find the perfect
all-American identity: Jack Barsky, who had died at the tender age of 10. Another agent posed as Barsky's father in
order to obtain a new birth certificate. Dittrich got a fake Canadian passport, which he used to enter the United
States.
Once over the border, he discarded the passport and was reborn as an American - Jack Barsky.
By the time Dittrich arrived in New York City with his new identity in October 1978 at age 29, he had boned up as
much as possible on Western pop culture.
Barsky landed a job as a bike messenger to create a credible work history and make some money, and got his GED.
In 1981, he enrolled at Baruch College, and in just three years earned a degree in computer systems with a 4.0
grade-point average. Getting perfect scores was no chore for the man who had earned an advanced chemistry
degree and even taught university classes back in Germany.
There was just one thing that made Barsky sweat: As class valedictorian, he would have to give a speech in front
of his classmates and their graduation-day guests.
""If my unauthorized public appearance came to the attention of my bosses in Moscow, I could reasonably expect
some sort of punishment,"" he recalls in the book.
He tried to shrug off this duty, claiming he was shy. But the dean wouldn't have it, and Barsky decided he could not
turn away from the challenge of his moment in the spotlight. So Jack Barsky, undercover KGB spy, climbed onto
one of New York's biggest stages - Madison Square Garden - and spoke to some 4,000 people as if he were one of
them.
He got a job in the information-technology department of Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., earning $21,500 a year
(or around $50,000 a year in today's dollars). The KGB was delighted with his posting.
""Insurance companies were always near the top of the list of capitalist villains in Communist propaganda,"" Barsky
writes. He quickly advanced in the company, just as his Moscow bosses hoped, and was able to conduct workplace
espionage - netting himself $10,000 from the KGB for transmitting to them software used by MetLife.
But he liked his job and felt he was treated well by co-workers. In fact, the KGB spy was getting comfortable in his
new American life: ""The chinks in my ideological armor began to grow into wide open cracks.""
He was also softened by love, having fallen for an undocumented immigrant from Guyana named Penelope.
Despite not being an American citizen himself, Barsky wed her in hopes of helping her get citizenship - as it turned
out, his driver's license and birth certificate were the only documents he needed to support that plan.
In a situation similar to the premise of the FX show ""The Americans,"" in which a married couple spy for the KGB,
they moved to Ozone Park, Queens, and Penelope gave birth to their daughter, Chelsea. The little girl immediately
became the light of Barsky's life. He writes, ""Love tiptoed up on me.""
It was a familiar feeling. After all, he already had two sons with an ex-girlfriend and a wife back in East Germany.
(His other wife knew he was a KGB agent, but little more.)
WHEN the ominous message came from Moscow in December 1988, Barsky ignored it.
""Prepare for urgent departure,"" it said. ""We have reason to believe that your cover has been blown. You are in
severe danger.""
Two weeks later, at the 80th Street/Hudson Street A train station, he spotted a small red dot painted on a support
beam - a KGB signal meaning he was to leave the country immediately.
He ignored that message, too.
Days after that, a man approached him on the subway platform. ""You must come home or else you are dead,"" he
told Barsky and walked away.
Barsky was crushed. He loved his wife and daughter. He had made friends and truly enjoyed his job - he had even
come to prefer the United States over Eastern Europe. Staying in America, he decided, was worth the risk, whether
it meant a blown cover, being kidnapped by the bosses or even assassination.
The way out of his dilemma hit Barsky like a thunderclap: He told Moscow he had AIDS.
At the time, AIDS was a death sentence. Barsky signaled that he contracted the disease from an ex-girlfriend who
got it from an earlier boyfriend and claimed he needed to drop out of sight for treatment. He asked his superiors to
give his East German wife $60,000 he had amassed in a KGB bank account. Then he broke contact.
Amazingly, the KGB assumed he died.
""I fully embraced my American existence,"" Barsky writes. Soon he and Penelope had a son, Jessie. MetLife
transferred Barsky to New Jersey, and the family moved to a house in rural Mount Bethel, Pa. Life was good - better
than he could've dreamed when he left East Germany.
He had no way of knowing his secret was slowly unraveling.
As the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Vasili Mitrokhin, a KGB archivist, fled with a trove of secret information
which he handed to British intelligence. Jack Barsky's name was in Mitrokhin's papers.
Clued in, the FBI started surveilling him and his family, searching their household trash at the Pennsylvania house
and moving a male and female agent into the home next door to watch him.
Barsky was brought down by his own attempts to save his now-foundering marriage.
""I need to tell you something,"" he told Penelope in their wiretapped home. He admitted that he had been a KGB
agent, and that he broke ties with Moscow to protect their family. ""I could have been captured or killed. Does that
mean anything to you?"" he pleaded.
In May 1997, Barsky was pulled over on Route 80 by a Pennsylvania State Trooper. When he stepped out of his car
at the officer's request, a second man approached. ""Special Agent Reilly, FBI,"" the man said. ""We would like to talk
with you.""
Reilly and another agent drove Barsky to a hotel where they had set up an interrogation center. ""Jack, this does not
have to be the worst day of your life,"" Reilly said. Barsky didn't need to be prompted to cooperate. Two hours later,
the agents let him go home, with the caveat that he was still under surveillance.
That weekend was Barsky's - Dittrich's - real 48th birthday. ""I wondered where I would spend my 50th,"" he writes. Over the following months, Barsky told the FBI everything he could. He knew only the first names of his KGB
comrades - and he wasn't sure those names were real. The only contact he remembered for sure was an address in
Berlin where he sent coded letters. ""The FBI already had that one,"" Barsky said.
The government decided not to charge him, and the FBI even helped legalize the identities of Barsky and his wife.
He and Joe Reilly, the FBI agent who brought him in, became true friends and golf buddies.
A free man - and officially now an American citizen - he continued his career in information technology, later
developing software for the New York Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid.
Mitrokhin's records led Barsky to believe he was part of a third wave of illegals the KGB hoped to set up in the US
between the end of World War II and the late 1980s.
Barsky said he was probably one of six illegals planned for that third group. ""How many of those six residencies
were actually established is not known,"" he says.
""According to Mitrokhin, all three waves failed miserably. I'm not surprised based on circumstances. This had
become a nearly impossible task to do, to establish yourself as an illegal and then actually get to a point where you
are in a position to either obtain secrets from somebody else, or steal them.""
Barsky figures he's now safe from any Russian assassination attempts - a fate that has allegedly befallen enemies
of Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""It's not worth it; there's no point to it,"" Barsky says. ""Anybody who might have
had a personal vendetta against me, they are either all dead or too old to care.""
All in all, Barsky, 67, is happy. Raised an atheist, he now has a strong Christian faith. He lives in Georgia with his
third wife and their daughter. Over the years, he has rebuilt his relationships with his German sons. On a 2015 trip
to Germany, he got a picture of himself with all four of his adult children. He's still good friends with Reilly, who is
retired from the FBI.
""The United States,"" he said, ""is still the greatest country in the world."""
Bank of America,Obituary End of a NY dynasty Billionaire David Rockefeller dies at 101," Mar 21, 2017",0,"David Rockefeller, the billionaire banker and philanthropist who spurred the building of the original World Trade
Center, died Monday. He was 101.
A spokesman said Rockefeller, the last in his generation of one of America's wealthiest dynasties, died in his sleep
at his home in Pocantico Hills, NY.
Rockefeller turned the family bank, Chase, into a global powerhouse during his reign as chief from 1961 to 1981.
He had close ties to many foreign leaders and was the first to conduct business in many countries.
Rockefeller was also a major figure in transforming the city's skyline. He was instrumental in persuading the UN to
locate its headquarters in Manhattan.
And it was Rockefeller who initiated the push to erect the World Trade Center, the outgrowth of a 550-block
redevelopment he helped craft to rejuvenate lower Manhattan. The project became a reality with the help of his
brother, Nelson, then New York's governor.
New Yorkers referred to the Twin Towers - half in jest - as David and Nelson.
David was the grandson of Standard Oil co-founder John D. Rockefeller and the youngest of six children born to
John D. Rockefeller Jr.
Tributes poured in.
""No individual has contributed more to the commercial and civic life of New York City over a longer period of time
than David Rockefeller,"" said former Mayor Mike Bloomberg.
Bloomberg noted that as a young man Rockefeller served as a $1-a-year secretary to Mayor Fiorello La Guardia
before joining the family banking business.
One of the major efforts of Rockefeller's later years was directed at restoring family influence in the landmark
Rockefeller Center, most of which had been sold in the 1980s to Japanese investors. He eventually organized an
investor group to buy back 45 percent of the property.
His philanthropy and other activities earned him a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian
honor, in 1998.
Rockefeller and his wife, the former Margaret McGrath, married in 1940 and had six children - David Jr., Richard,
Abby, Neva, Margaret and Eileen. His wife, an active conservationist, died in 1996.
With the passing of his siblings, he became the Rockefeller in charge of his family's fortune and head of a
sprawling network of family interests that ranged from environmental conservation to the arts.
To mark his 100th birthday in 2015, Rockefeller gave 1,000 acres of land next to a national park to the state of Maine.
Rockefeller defended capitalism as a force of good. ""American capitalism has brought more benefits to more
people than any other system in any part of the world at any time in history,"" he said.
But he also spoke of the obligation of wealthy people like himself to pay their fair share of taxes.
Forbes estimated his fortune at $3.3 billion.
