 LONDON/FRANKFURT —  German broadcaster ProSiebenSat 1 Media rejected a critical report on Tuesday by short-seller Viceroy Research, saying the allegations of questionable accounting contained in it were ""unfounded and distorting reality"". ProSieben's shares fell as much as 9 percent after the release of the report, which coincided with news the company was dropping out of Germany's DAX Index of blue-chip stocks. Viceroy, which has targeted companies including South African retailer Steinhoff, alleged in its 37-page report that ProSieben had overpaid for acquisitions and was inflating revenues from non-cash transactions. In particular, it took aim at ProSieben's media-for-equity model, in which it offers free advertising airtime on its channels in exchange for stakes in companies the broadcaster is investing in. Advertisement ""ProSieben has subsidized a fabricated digital 'growth story' using cash flows from its TV advertising business and idle TV advertising inventory,"" the report said. Advertisement ""As its core business declines, ProSieben can no longer counterbalance its underperforming digital segments - the earnings structure is on the brink of collapse."" Viceroy put a valuation of 7.51 euros (6.69 pounds) on ProSieben's shares, a 75 percent discount to Monday's closing price. In a statement, the Munich-based broadcaster dismissed Viceroy's allegations out of hand and said it would respond in more detail in due course ""The allegations of short-seller Viceroy contained in their report are unfounded and distorting reality,"" ProSieben said, reiterating its 2017 results and outlook published on Feb. 22. Viceroy's report into Steinhoff was followed by an admission of ""accounting irregularities"" that triggered an 85-percent slide in its share price. The South African government has, however, called for an investigation into Viceroy after a separate report on Capitec sparked a sell-off in the bank's stock.  . SHORT-SELLER TARGET ProSieben has for months been in the sights of short sellers - speculators who position themselves to profit from share-price falls - as the company was forced to issue a series of outlook downgrades due to weak TV ad revenues. Despite former CEO Thomas Ebeling's drive to diversify into business lines such as e-commerce, weak ad revenues eventually proved to be his undoing and he stepped down as CEO last month after nine years in charge. Advertisement He was replaced by Max Conze, former CEO at British vacuum cleaner maker Dyson. In December, Swedish hedge fund Bodenholm Capital disclosed a short position in ProSieben, saying the company was losing market share, as well as criticising the number of one-off costs the business reported. Other funds that have shorted Prosieben's shares include AQR Capital Management and Old Mutual Global Investors, according to German regulatory filings. Viceroy founder Fraser Perring told Reuters he had a fundamentally bearish take on the media sector, as young viewers flee and digital platforms attract advertisers. His attitude towards ProSieben's media-for-equity model was that ""it smacks of desperation"". ""They are recognising value of equity significantly higher than what it is worth. If they were a private equity firm, what is their strategy, what are their synergies?"" he told Reuters. More broadly, broadcast media faces an onslaught from platform giants like Amazon and Netflix with their video-on-demand offering of original TV content and Hollywood hits attracting millions of viewers. Netflix, whose shares have risen 64 percent so far this year, has added more than the equivalent of ProSieben's entire equity market value in the last two trading days alone. ProSieben's shares were down 5.2 percent at 28.47 euros as of 1330 GMT, valuing the company at about $8 billion.

 SAN FRANCISCO —  The Nasdaq blasted through a record high on Friday as traders looking to ride recent momentum piled into Microsoft, Netflix, Amazon.com and other high-performance technology names. The rise came alongside a broad rally in the market. The S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose sharply - up 1.5 percent - as February's jobs report assuaged fears of inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes. The gains came nine years to the day since the bull market began. Microsoft, Apple and Amazon each rose more than 1 percent and hit or closely approached all-time highs, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index surged 1.8 percent to its own record. Those stock moves helped push the Nasdaq Composite Index up 1.4 percent to 7,532 points, which is about a third of a percent higher than its previous all-time high on Jan 26. Advertisement The Nasdaq and the S&P 500, also up about 1.4 percent, were both helped by employment data that tempered fears of faster interest rate increases. Advertisement There was no major news specifically related to the tech sector driving its gains. Netflix jumped 3.6 percent, also hitting a record high and bringing the video streaming service's gain in the past year to 65 percent. ""You look at tech and think, 'What is the catalyst that's going to bring it down?' I don't see one in the short term, and that makes me confident as a trader to go into those stocks that have been the leaders,"" said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC.  . Technology stocks have been widely viewed in recent months as a ""crowded trade,"" a situation where most investors have the same opinion, increasing the potential for a volatile selloff if sentiment changes. For example, Bank of Montreal in January launched an exchange traded fund aiming to triple the return of 10 stocks, including the so-called FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix Inc and Google parent Alphabet. Large cap active fund managers recently trimmed their relative weight in technology stocks to 1.18 times the broader market, down from 1.23 last month, giving up to discretionary stocks its position as the most crowded sector, according to a recent report from Bank of America. The Nasdaq is up 9 percent year to date, compared to a 3 percent increase in S&P 500, which has yet to recover from a February selloff sparked by fears of higher interest rates.

 WASHINGTON —  The U.S. Justice Department and AT&T Inc on Friday presented starkly different futures for online video if the wireless and pay-TV giant is allowed to buy Time Warner Inc, as they laid out their cases for a blockbuster antitrust trial. The judge's decision is crucial to the future of both companies and will likely determine how aggressive Republican-controlled antitrust regulators will be in coming years. U.S. President Donald Trump opposes the deal, and critics want to know if Trump's antipathy for Time Warner's CNN news network influenced regulators. In their final briefs before the trial opens on March 19, the two sides disagreed on whether the $85 billion deal would harm rivals in pay television or online video and sparred over whether consumers would pay more because of the planned merger. The Justice Department filed a lawsuit in November to stop AT&T, which owns DirecTV and other products with 25 million subscribers, from buying movie and TV show maker Time Warner, which owns HBO and CNN, among many other channels. Advertisement It argued the deal would mean higher prices for rival cable and online video distributors and for consumers. Advertisement Investors and company executives had been expecting more leeway in mergers with a Republican administration that vowed to reduce government regulation. The outcome of the case could affect other pending vertical mergers, in which different parts of a supply chain, rather than rivals in the same business, join together. Health insurer Cigna Corp wants to buy pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co and CVS Health Corp wants to acquire health insurer Aetna Inc. ""If the Justice Department loses to AT&T in court this will substantially raise the barriers to the Justice Department bringing another vertical challenge such as with respect to CVS/Aetna or Cigna/Express Scripts,"" said Seth Bloom, a veteran of the Justice Department now in private practice. GOVERNMENT SAYS CONSUMERS WILL PAY MORE; AT&T SAYS NO The Justice Department used economic modeling to show that consumers will pay their pay TV provider more for Turner Broadcasting content, if U.S. District Judge Richard Leon allows the deal.  . ""The acquisition would give AT&T a new tool to slow down the development and growth of disruptive online competitors in the future,"" the department added in its brief. ""AT&T can profess it wants to lead the charge to the future, but its internal documents reveal a less attractive reality."" For its part, AT&T said the merger would result in ""more than $2.5 billion in annual synergies by 2020 and more than $25 billion in total synergies on a net present value basis."" AT&T and Time Warner said prices would not rise because the company would compete with newer media companies like Facebook Inc , Alphabet Inc , Amazon.com Inc  and Netflix Inc. ""Nothing will be withheld from competitors; consumer prices will not go up,"" the companies said, arguing the lawsuit itself was holding back consumer access to better products. On Thursday, 11 former Justice Department officials ranging from Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney, and John Dean, President Richard Nixon's lawyer during the Watergate scandal, urged Judge Leon to reconsider his refusal to allow AT&T to demand communications between the White House and Justice Department about the merger probe.

 ___ Bids to curb health care costs offer little more than talk WASHINGTON (AP) — What began as bipartisan attempt to curb soaring health care premiums in the nation's health insurance markets is faltering in Congress. At fault are escalating demands from each party and erratic positions by President Donald Trump. Democrats want bigger federal subsidies for consumers under President Barack Obama's health care law. Republicans aim to relax its coverage requirements and win abortion restrictions. The bickering could collapse the whole effort, with each side blaming the other. ___ Trump says commerce secretary will talk tariffs with EU WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump says his commerce secretary will be talking to the European Union about tariffs that he argues have been unfair to the United States. Writing on Twitter, Trump says Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will speak with EU representatives about ""eliminating the large Tariffs and Barriers they use against the U.S.A."" The president announced last week that the United States would impose heavy tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, with some countries potentially exempted. ___ Get Started: Can't pay the IRS? You do have options NEW YORK (AP) — With a little more than five weeks until this year's tax filing deadline of April 17, many small business owners are tussling with the question, how am I going to pay my taxes? When owners haven't set aside enough money to cover their taxes, they do have options, including using savings, borrowing money or working out a payment plan with the IRS. But not filing a return because you can't pay isn't one of them. The IRS levies hefty penalties when a tax return is filed after the deadline. ___ Apple adds more 'Texture' to its services with magazine deal SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple has bought digital magazine distributor Texture to extend its subscription services beyond music and online storage. The deal announced Monday puts Apple in control of a service that is often described as a Netflix of magazines. Texture offers readers access to articles in more than 200 magazines for $10 per month, much like Netflix sells unlimited access to its video programming. Apple didn't disclose the price it is paying for Texture. Advertisement ___ Goldman Sachs CEO succession clearer with Schwartz retiring NEW YORK (AP) — Harvey Schwartz, a top executive at Goldman Sachs, is retiring next month, clearing the way for David Solomon to eventually become the next chief executive of the Wall Street firm. Schwartz and Solomon jointly hold the positions of co-chief operating officer and president. Both had been considered likely successors to Lloyd Blankfein, the current CEO. Advertisement ___ House Democrat seeks data on Trump firm donation to Treasury WASHINGTON (AP) — A senior House Democrat is asking the Trump Organization and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to provide more information on a $151,470 donation the Trump family firm turned over to the government. President Donald Trump pledged last year to donate profits from foreign government patronage at his company's properties. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., asked a Trump Organization lawyer to provide documents on the company's foreign government payments and how it calculated its donation.  . ___ China shrinks steel industry slowly, drawing Western ire BEIJING (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump's blanket tariff hike on steel and aluminum reflects American ire over a flood of low-cost exports from China, whose steel output accounts for half the world's supply. The industry swelled over the past decade to support a history-making Chinese construction boom. China has closed some steel mills but is moving too gradually to defuse American and European anger at a flood of low-cost exports. ___ US budget deficit jumped to $215.2 billion in February WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal government recorded a budget deficit of $215.2 billion in February, up significantly from a year ago as the impact of the GOP tax cuts passed in December begin to surface. The Treasury Department reports that the February deficit was 12.1 percent higher than a year ago, reflecting in part a drop of $5 billion in individual withholding taxes paid last month compared to a year ago. ___ Tech gains but industrials slide, leaving indexes mixed NEW YORK (AP) — Technology companies continue to rally Monday while industrial companies slump, leaving stock indexes mixed at the close of trading. The tech industry has led the market's recovery from its recent lows while industrials were coming off a big gain Friday.

 NEW YORK — U.S. stocks rallied on Monday as fears of a global trade war ebbed with investors betting that U.S. President Donald Trump would back down on his threat to impose hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Strategists also cited rising oil prices and ebbing concerns after an Italian election for a relief rally in the three major U.S. equity indexes.

Here’s what we’re watching: • Fed is working on ‘material changes’ to Volcker Rule. • Will Quarles end the post-Volcker quiet? • Big foreign banks and the Senate’s deregulation bill. • S.&P. 500 futures are down amid tariff threats and Italy’s election results. • How Washington intervened in Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm. • The school protection industry is seeing business get busier. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Changes are coming to the so-called Volcker Rule, the post-financial crisis era measure intended to rein in aggressive trading by Wall Street banks. Advertisement The Federal Reserve is in the process of working with other regulatory agencies to make “material changes” to the rule. Randal K. Quarles, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, said the central bank is working toward rewriting portions of the Volcker Rule during a speech on Monday. Advertisement Mr. Quarles took issue with many parts of the rule — inspired by Paul Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman. Mr. Quarles said the rule was “an example of a complex regulation that is not working well,” and that the Fed is working on revisions to make the rule less burdensome to firms that do not have large trading desks. Mr. Quarles did not give a time-frame to revise the rule but said the Fed’s goal was to write something that would formally be submitted for public comment. He said regulators want to make “clearer and more transparent” what kind of trading is governed by the Volcker Rule — something he said has been a source of frustration for regulators and bankers. The Volcker Rule has been credited with curtailing the ability of banks to make risky and speculative trades for their own account — which some contend contributed to some of the excesses that led up to the financial crisis of a decade ago. — Matthew Goldstein The Federal Reserve is gearing up for a far-reaching overhaul of the Volcker Rule. The rule’s critics, including Randal K. Quarles, head of supervision at the Fed, say it is too burdensome on banks. But there may be one group of people who hope that the Fed doesn’t gut the rule: Investors in bank stocks. Since the Volcker Rule took effect in 2015, they’ve been able to worry much less about traders saddling their institutions with overwhelming losses. In fact, there hasn’t been a big trading meltdown at a large United States bank since the London Whale debacle at JPMorgan Chase, which happened prior to 2015 and arguably lit a fire under regulators to finalize the rule. Contrary to some analyses of the financial crisis, proprietary trading contributed to the weakness of financial system . Who can forget Morgan Stanley’s disastrous subprime wager that saddled the bank with $9 billion of losses? Advertisement And by shedding proprietary traders, banks may have dodged no end of bullets. When a star commodities trader, Andrew J. Hall, left Citigroup, there was concern that the bank lost a crucial money maker. But the hedge fund Mr. Hall ran after he left Citigroup suffered outsize losses. And the list of bank traders who later racked up big losses at hedge funds is not short. — Peter Eavis The retailer has rejected its founding family’s takeover offer. A group of Nordstrom family members, which control 21 percent of the company, had offered $50 a share for the shares it does not already own. The Special Committee has directed its advisors and management not to provide further due diligence information to the Group. Furthermore, unless the Group can promptly and substantially improve the price it is proposing to pay for the Company, the Special Committee intends to terminate discussions. It was a brash move, even by Wall Street’s standards. Deutsche Bank, a giant German bank with a big trading business in the United States, took emergency loans from the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis a decade ago. But later, Deutsche Bank changed the legal classification of its Wall Street operations, a step that for a time shielded it from United States banking regulations. Deutsche Bank’s actions, and those of other large foreign banks during that period, now loom over a piece of banking deregulation legislation that the Senate may approve this week. The bill loosens the part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the 2010 overhaul of the United States financial system, that imposed stricter regulations on larger banks, including foreign ones. Specifically, the bill — sponsored by Senator Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho — would lighten the regulation of banks that have less than $250 billion in loans, securities and other assets, a group that includes American banks like SunTrust and BB&T. But the bill’s critics are concerned that it would allow far larger foreign banks to chip away at rules designed to prevent them wriggling out of United States safeguards. The authors of the new bill reject such fears. “Folks are peddling a lot of misinformation about our bipartisan bill, but if you look at the bill text you will see that large foreign banks will be subject to the same enhanced prudential standards,” Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, said in a statement. “Our legislation provides targeted regulatory relief for local lenders in Montana and rural America.” (“Enhanced prudential standards” is the regulatory term for stricter rules.) And the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, speaking before a Senate committee last week, said he did not think the bill would allow foreign banks to operate under a softer set of rules. Advertisement Mr. Powell based his assertion on how Dodd-Frank is written. It states that banks over $50 billion in consolidated assets require stricter oversight. The new bill moves that up to $250 billion. But even though the likes of Deutsche Bank, UBS and Credit Suisse have less than $250 billion in United States assets, they have far more than that on a consolidated basis around the world. And since the new bill does not amend the part of Dodd-Frank that requires regulators to use consolidated assets, the Fed can continue to apply its enhanced regulations to foreign banks. So, why are opponents of the bill, like Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, concerned? They point to remarks made by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Congress earlier this year. When Senator Brown asked Mr. Mnuchin if he believed the new bill would reduce regulations for foreign banks, he said: “That is correct.” Indeed, the Treasury, when it set out its aims in a report last year for reducing financial regulations, included relief for foreign banks. (A Treasury official on Monday sought to clarify Mr. Mnuchin’s answer to Senator Brown. The official said Mr. Mnuchin was responding to the senator’s remarks about the Treasury’s report that came before his question about the impact of Senator Crapo’s bill.) Critics also point out that the Fed in part based its post-crisis rules for foreign banks on language in Dodd-Frank that required the rules establish fair competition between foreign and domestic banks. If the bill passes, and the Fed gives foreign banks no relief from certain regulations, the foreign banks could argue in a lawsuit that they are competitively disadvantaged against American banks with assets under $250 billion that did get such relief, some opponents of the bill contend. And the Fed did in one place veer from using consolidated assets when applying regulations to foreign banks. The Fed in 2014 said that foreign banks with less than $50 billion in United States assets (not a global consolidated measure) would be eligible for less stringent requirements under its foreign banking rule. That could create the grounds for raising that bar for lighter regulation from to $250 billion from $50 billion, critics of the bill argue. But supporters of the bill contend that United States laws give the Fed substantial leeway to continue applying stricter regulation to foreign banks. What might happen if Senator Crapo’s bill passes? It seems unlikely that big foreign banks are going to get an immediate pass from stricter regulations. But the pre-crisis period shows that, over a longer period, banks and their lawyers press for changes when they see regulators relax. — Peter Eavis The most dramatic story in M.&A. has taken another twist — one that raises questions about how assertively the Trump administration will regulate deal-making. Advertisement What happened: The U.S. government panel that reviews deals for national security concerns, known as Cfius, has asked Qualcomm to postpone its shareholder meeting, scheduled for tomorrow, by 30 days so it could further review Broadcom’s hostile takeover bid. Broadcom’s response pulled no punches, accusing Qualcomm of covertly reaching out to regulators: This was a blatant, desperate act by Qualcomm to entrench its incumbent board of directors and prevent its own stockholders from voting for Broadcom’s independent director nominees. Why: Members of Cfius have asked whether the takeover could put the U.S. behind China in the race for 5G wireless technology. Qualcomm’s biggest rival in the space is Huawei, and Qualcomm has argued that Broadcom, a serial acquirer and noted cost-cutter, could hurt crucial 5G research and development. (And Michael noted on Friday that there’s more to it than that.) Where the vote stands: Many early votes favored Broadcom: The shareholder advisory firms I.S.S. and Glass, Lewis recommended giving it at least four seats. But a top-30 investor, Parnassus, had said it supported Qualcomm. Michael hears that both sides have been especially focused on lobbying the biggest shareholders, BlackRock and Vanguard. The bigger picture: The White House has already blocked the sale of a U.S. tech company to a Chinese buyer on national security grounds. If it steps in here — in an unusually aggressive move by Cfius, which normally acts after a proposed deal is filed for review — would deal makers lose heart?

The Infatuation is set to announce on Monday that it has bought Zagat from Google. From Michael de la Merced: The deal will bolster the profile of the nine-year-old The Infatuation. But it also raises questions about whether Zagat, once the 800-pound gorilla of restaurant recommendations, can remain relevant when a slew of younger digital competitors have emerged and thrived. Background Then Google bought Zagat seven years ago under the direction of Marissa Mayer, who went on to become Yahoo’s chief executive. The plan was to integrate it into its mapping service, but life under Google has sometimes been rocky for the business, including a de-emphasizing of Zagat content in favor of Google’s own collected recommendations. About The Infatuation The company was founded nine years ago by Chris Stang and Andrew Steinthal, who a way to recommend restaurants and bars to their friends. The company has succeeded in part by embracing technologies both new and old: It popularized “#EEEEEATS” as a branded hashtag on Instagram, and runs a slew of food-related accounts on the social network. It also rolled out Text Rex, a texting recommendation service staffed by humans to recommend eateries for users’ particular situations. The company said it became profitable last year.

So far, it has been cautious, in part because Chinese steel makes up just 2 percent of American steel imports. U.S. allies who stand to be hit have been far more outspoken.

T1,22-Feb-18,"Advertisement Supported by By Michael M. Grynbaum WASHINGTON — A comedian has agreed to tell jokes at this year’s White House Correspondents’ Association dinner. Now the question is whether President Trump will show up to hear the punch lines. Michelle Wolf, a stand-up comic and frequent contributor to “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah,” will be the featured entertainer at the annual gathering on April 28, the association announced on Thursday, taking on one of the most prominent — and perilous — gigs in comedy. Long a high point of the Washington social calendar, the correspondents’ dinner typically offers journalists and presidents a chance to roast one another on live television in a celebrity-packed ballroom. But Mr. Trump, not one to encourage comity with the White House press corps, skipped last year’s proceedings, the first president to do so since Ronald Reagan in 1981. (Mr. Reagan, who had recently survived an assassination attempt, called in from his hospital bed.) And the White House said this week that Mr. Trump had not yet made a decision about this year. Either way, Ms. Wolf, 32, has her work cut out for her. Washington journalists are a notoriously tough crowd; witness the stony silence that met Stephen Colbert after his blistering 2006 monologue about George W. Bush. The comedian Larry Wilmore, who appeared in 2016, prompted controversy when he used a racial slur in his remarks about Barack Obama. The coziness of the event — where reporters hobnob with the politicians they cover — can be awkward, too, leading some journalists to stifle their laughter, lest they be caught on camera appearing too gleeful at the president’s expense. But the dinner can be a proving ground for comics. Hasan Minhaj, last year’s entertainer, received high marks for his balanced performance, coming at the height of tensions between Mr. Trump and the press. Ms. Wolf, who has also written for “Late Night With Seth Meyers,” recently signed a deal with Netflix to develop a weekly late-night talk show of her own. She gained notice last year for an HBO comedy special, “Nice Lady,” that Jason Zinoman, the comedy critic for The New York Times, praised for its “silly fart jokes tied to meaty social commentaries that spin out into unexpected personal confessions interrupted by nicely crafted one-liners.” Margaret Talev, a White House reporter for Bloomberg News who is president of the correspondents’ association, said that Ms. Wolf’s “truth-to-power style makes her a great friend to the W.H.C.A.” “Her Pennsylvania roots, stints on Wall Street and in science, and self-made, feminist edge make her the right voice now,” Ms. Talev said in a statement. If Mr. Trump attends the April dinner, it could create a far more charged dynamic in the room. The president rarely holds back in his searing attacks on the journalists who cover him, but might he temper his style in a more formal setting? An answer of sorts could come in early March when the president makes his first appearance at another of Washington’s major roasts: the white-tie Gridiron Club gala. The Gridiron, organized by an elite club of Washington journalists, is a more genteel version of the correspondents’ dinner, featuring skits and jokes performed by reporters and lawmakers. Outside comics are not invited, and the event is not expected to be televised. Mr. Trump skipped the event last year — Vice President Mike Pence spoke in his stead — but there is precedent for spotty presidential attendance: Barack Obama did not speak there until his third year in office. Of course, Mr. Trump’s history with the correspondents’ dinner is more fraught. In 2011, the future president attended the event, only to be brutally mocked by Mr. Obama and the featured entertainer, Mr. Meyers. Mr. Trump’s displeasure that evening has since been cited as a prime motivator for his subsequent presidential run.    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS One subscription.Endless discovery.

 LONDON — Comcast may have found a way to disrupt Walt Disney Company’s plan to buy most of 21st Century Fox: topping Fox’s bid to buy the British satellite broadcaster Sky with its own $31 billion takeover offer. The bid, plans for which were announced on Tuesday, seizes upon 21st Century Fox’s difficulties buying the piece of Sky that it does not already own. British regulators have expressed repeated concerns about giving Rupert Murdoch and his family more control over the country’s media, stretching the approval process out over more than a year and forcing 21st Century Fox to offer more concessions. Comcast has said that buying Sky would help it expand in Europe, where the broadcaster has 23 million customers and owns rights to show the English Premier League and other professional soccer leagues. Disney, too, has been keen on expanding internationally, with the British company serving as an important part of its $52 billion plan to buy a significant portion of 21st Century Fox. Whoever prevails, it will shake up Disney’s plans. Either 21st Century Fox will have to pay more for Sky, or Disney will lose a valuable international property to Comcast. Advertisement In a statement, 21st Century Fox said that it “remains committed to its recommended cash offer for Sky,” which it made in 2016. Advertisement Disney, Comcast and others are rushing to strike major deals in a swiftly changing media landscape. AT&T has bid more than $85 billion to take over Time Warner, a proposed merger that the Justice Department is attempting to block. Consumers increasingly stream their movies and televisions shows over the internet. Upstart technology companies like Apple and Amazon nurture ambitions to rival Hollywood’s big studios. Online broadcasters are even increasingly bidding for the rights to show sports — long a major moneymaking business for traditional broadcasters and cable operators. The saga over Sky has been one of the most drawn out deal-making dramas in media. Mr. Murdoch, the 21st Century Fox executive chairman, has tried for years to take full control of the broadcaster, which he started in 1989. By owning the rest of Sky, 21st Century Fox would be better positioned to take on the likes of Netflix, Amazon and other streaming giants. In 2011, Mr. Murdoch was forced to withdraw a $12 billion offer for the rest of Sky as a firestorm erupted over phone hacking by the news media in Britain. The scandal eventually led to the closing of The News of the World, the first newspaper Mr. Murdoch acquired in Britain in the late 1960s. In December 2016, 21st Century Fox tried again, in an effort to expand its global reach and cement Mr. Murdoch’s legacy. The company agreed to buy the 61 percent of Sky that it does not own for about $16 billion. While the Office of Communications, or Ofcom, ruled in June that Mr. Murdoch and other company executives were “fit and proper” to hold broadcasting licenses in Britain, it also said that the deal warranted more scrutiny. In the regulator’s view, the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News had amounted to “significant corporate failures.” Then last month, Britain’s competition regulator provisionally rejected the deal, saying that it was “not in the public interest.” The regulator said it was concerned that the deal would give the Murdoch family “too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda.” It noted at the time that Murdoch-controlled outlets, which include the newspapers The Sun and The Times of London, were already consumed by nearly a third of Britain’s population. In hopes of winning over regulators, 21st Century Fox has offered to establish a “fully independent” editorial board for Sky News and to continue to fund the Sky News brand after the transaction for at least 10 years. Advertisement 21st Century Fox had hoped to complete the Sky deal before the Disney sale was finalized. But Comcast’s move just adds uncertainty to an already complicated process. Disney, which declined to comment on Comcast’s proposal, must now decide how much it cares about Sky. It is also not clear if Disney would want to end up being partners with Comcast, in the event that Comcast wins majority control of Sky and Disney ultimately has Fox’s 39 percent stake. While announcing the planned purchase of Fox’s entertainment assets in December, Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, singled out Sky as “a real crown jewel” in a television interview with Bloomberg. “We certainly would be looking forward to the opportunity to have Sky be part of our company,” he said.  . Comcast has circled 21st Century Fox in the past. Last year, the cable giant was in preliminary talks to buy the entertainment assets owned by 21st Century Fox, including the minority stake in Sky. Disney ultimately prevailed. At the very least, Comcast has most likely made it more expensive for 21st Century Fox to buy all of Sky. Under the terms of its proposed bid, Comcast said, it would pay 12.50 pounds, about $17.50, a share in cash. That would represent a premium of 13 percent over its closing price on Monday and is about 16 percent above 21st Century Fox’s current offer of £10.75. On Tuesday, shares of the British broadcaster jumped by nearly one-fifth. The stock surge suggested investors expected 21st Century Fox to back away or come back with an even better offer. Comcast shareholders seemed less pleased. The company’s stock price dropped more than 6 percent in midday trading, to about $37. Disney shares fell 4 percent, to about $105.50, and Fox shares declined 2.6 percent, to about $37.80. An influential media analyst, Craig Moffett, who follows Comcast for MoffettNathanson, wrote in a research note that the Sky offer had positive aspects, including offering Comcast’s entertainment unit, NBCUniversal, broader distribution in Europe. Still, “Comcast will have to twist themselves into knots to explain why satellite distribution won’t be just as obsolete in Europe as it already is in the U.S.,” Mr. Moffett said. “Perhaps worst of all, this morning’s bid doesn’t really put to rest the idea that they might still try a topping bid for Fox’s U.S. assets, including the rest of Sky” if the Justice Department ends up approving AT&T’s takeover of Time Warner. Advertisement “The notion that Comcast might make a topping bid for Fox has weighed heavily on Comcast shares,” he added. For either Comcast or Disney, Sky offers a platform for international expansion. Comcast said in a statement that about a quarter of its revenue would come from international operations should it seal a deal with Sky, up from 9 percent currently. In addition to its other businesses, Sky has also announced plans to start streaming services in Spain and Switzerland. “We look at Sky as a media company: Sky News, Sky Sports, Sky Movies,” Brian L. Roberts, Comcast’s chairman and chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts. “There’s tremendous presence in the content creation, not just the distribution.” In a research note on Tuesday, Polo Tang, a UBS analyst, said that Sky could be “strategically interesting” to a variety of bidders, given its content and its broadcast and streaming distribution network. It also recently retained the rights to the Premier League at a lower cost than analysts had expected. Mr. Tang said that the benign outcome of the Premier League auction potentially “gives Fox scope to raise its offers.” Comcast said it was seeking control of more than half of Sky’s shares with Tuesday’s offer but was ultimately interested in acquiring all of the British broadcaster. In a statement, Sky urged shareholders to take no action yet. The broadcaster added that its independent directors “are mindful of their fiduciary duties and their obligations under the U.K. Takeover Code.” Follow Chad Bray on Twitter: @Chadbray Brooks Barnes contributed reporting from Los Angeles.

The offer, writes Liam Proud of Breakingviews, leaves Fox with two unappealing options to save its deal with Disney. Rupert Murdoch can either “revise the terms of the Disney sale to exclude Sky, or enter into a bidding war with” Comcast. Advertisement Sky investors seem to be betting on the latter option. Its stock jumped nearly 20 percent and is now trading above Comcast’s offer. Advertisement The reason for that may be that “both Fox and Disney have reasons for wanting to possess all of Sky,” writes Chris Hughes of Bloomberg Gadfly. “Fox may want full ownership as an insurance policy against the sale to Disney failing. And Disney’s desire to buy Fox’s current stake in Sky suggests it likes the asset, wants more of it and would want to prevent Comcast owning it.” In fact, Robert Iger, Disney’s chief executive, has called Sky the crown jewel of his company’s purchase of Fox assets. Reaction • Frank Louthan, an analyst at Raymond James: “The potential for Fox to return and make a competing bid remains high, in our view, as our European investment team believes Sky is the best-in-class European leader in Pay-TV.” When is an offer an offer can be a fine point under Britain’s complicated takeover rules. On Tuesday, Comcast announced a “possible all-cash offer” to acquire Sky, the British satellite broadcaster, for about $31 billion . Sky and 21st Century Fox, which has been trying to acquire the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own for more than year, both responded that “no firm offer” had been made. That may seem like an odd distinction when Comcast, the owner of NBCUniversal, announced publicly how much it is willing to pay for an asset to kick off negotiations. But, that comes down to Britain’s extensive takeover code, which spans more than 400 pages, and can often trip up American companies not used to operating under those rules. The public disclosure of merger talks is triggered under the code when a number of factors occur, such as rumors in the market that a deal is in the works or “untoward movement” in a takeover target’s stock price. Advertisement Making a public announcement then starts a countdown clock for a potential acquirer to announce a formal offer under the rules, known as a so-called firm intention to make an offer. The rules are intended to make sure all shareholders are treated fairly and have access to the same information about a deal and to establish an orderly framework for takeovers. - Chad Bray We’d waited to see if Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chairman and C.E.O., would challenge Walt Disney for control of 21st Century Fox. Instead, he plans to disrupt Mr. Murdoch’s bid for full control of Sky, the British satellite broadcaster. What Comcast is offering: £12.50, or about $17.50, a share for all of Sky What Fox is offering: £10.75 a share for the 61 percent of Sky that it doesn’t own Behind the maneuvers Comcast had worked on its own offer for Fox, with the chance to expand internationally through Sky being a big reason for bidding. But the Murdochs and their advisers believed that it would be difficult for Comcast to win U.S. regulatory approval. However, Fox’s bid for Sky has been held up by questions by British regulators about whether Mr. Murdoch was fit and proper to control a major broadcaster in the U.K. That presented Comcast’s opportunity. What Mr. Roberts said in Comcast’s regulatory statement: “We already have a strong presence in London, and Comcast intends to use Sky as a platform for our growth in Europe.” Whom to thank for the Comcast bid 
            Someone needs to find this cabbie pic.twitter.com/lH4SFcggcp  Critics’ corner • Paul Richards of the media research firm Numis told the FT that Comcast’s bid is a “very strong competitive offer.” Advertisement • Alex DeGroote at Cenkos Securities told Bloomberg, “The market was anticipating another approach and will be pleasantly surprised.” Market reaction Comcast investors don’t seem pleasantly surprised. Shares of Comcast are down 5.2 percent. Sky’s stock popped nearly 20 percent and is now trading above Comcast’s offer. When Jerome H. Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday, we may see if he has mastered the art of stern but subtle disapproval. Congress has recently enacted tax cuts and spending increases that could stimulate the economy at a time when the Fed may want to tamp things down a bit. A tug of war could end up occurring between elected politicians wanting a boom to continue and a central bank that is concerned about government deficits and inflation. It is highly unlikely that Mr. Powell or any other Fed official would want to get drawn into a direct, public fight with members of Congress or the administration of President Donald Trump. So, how might Mr. Powell express concern about loose government fiscal policies? He can talk about Congress’s stimulus as just one of many factors that can have an impact on the Fed’s mission of creating the economic conditions for maximum employment and stable prices. In other words, he could depersonalize any tensions, and imply that concern about spending and deficits is just the Fed doing its job. And in his prepared testimony for the hearing, Mr. Powell noted the stimulus from fiscal policy. “In gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the F.O.M.C. will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing P.C.E. price inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis. While many factors shape the economic outlook, some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds: In particular, fiscal policy has become more stimulative and foreign demand for U.S. exports is on a firmer trajectory.” (F.O.M.C. is the Federal Open Market Committee, the committee that sets monetary policy, while P.C.E. price inflation is the Fed’s preferred measure of prices, derived from a survey of personal consumption expenditures conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.) Update from the hearing In this testimony before the House committee on Tuesday, Mr. Powell took some questions about the recent loosening of fiscal policy, and how the Fed might respond. Advertisement He followed the careful path outlined above. On the one hand, he noted that government finances can have an impact on economic conditions, saying: “Fiscal policy changes can have an effect.” He also said: “We really need to get on a sustainable fiscal path, and the time for doing that is now.” On the other hand, Mr. Powell said the Fed did not want to directly interfere in government spending decisions. “We don’t do fiscal policy at the Fed,” he said. — Peter Eavis That’s according to GeekWire and confirmed by CNBC.

T1,28-Feb-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin FEB. 28, 2018
 Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Spotify files to go public. • Dick’s Sporting Goods will stop selling assault-style rifles. • The end of an era for Ackman; the start for another one? • What to make of Wall Street’s response to Mr. Powell? • The Federal Reserve is walking a monetary tightrope. • And is Jared Kushner’s weakness his family business?

It is funneling billions of dollars from its subscribers to music companies, which, for the most part, faced a bleak future. But a charity Spotify is not. The company appears to be taking a bigger and bigger cut of the revenue it receives from listeners, according to numbers first made public on Wednesday. Advertisement The numbers are included in Spotify’s financial filing with Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of listing its shares on the United States stock market. They strongly suggest that Spotify has successfully flexed its muscle as it negotiates the price it pays record companies for music. This shows up starkly in the filing’s discussion of an expense item called cost of revenues, which, the filing says, “consists predominately of royalty and distribution costs related to content streaming.” Advertisement The filing says Spotify had €3.67 billion of premium streaming revenue last year. The cost of that revenue last year was €2.87 billion. The difference between those numbers, the gross profit on streaming revenue, was equivalent to 22 percent of that revenue. That is well up from 16 percent in 2016 and 15 percent in 2015. And how did Spotify bolster its margins? A big factor: It signed more advantageous licensing agreements with music companies. “This decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of premium revenue was driven largely by a reduction in content costs pursuant to new licensing agreements,” the filing said. But can Spotify keep turning the screw? The music companies might be willing to compromise on price because the overall amount of dollars they receive is going up, making life easier for the first time in years. But, with Apple, Amazon and others adding subscribers, competition is intensifying. The music industry might be able to exploit that. — Peter Eavis Accounting nerds delving into Spotify’s filing will have stumbled on an odd discrepancy. Two metrics that attempt to capture how much cash a company is taking in had very different totals for 2017. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was negative to the tune of €324 million last year. But net cash flows from operations totaled €179 million in 2017. Both totals benefited from adding back large noncash financing costs. So what items bolstered operating cash flows but not Ebitda? It looks like operating cash flows did better in part because Spotify waited to pay some of its bills. Such items make up what is often called working capital. Spotify wrung €439 million of cash out of working capital in 2017. The question for investors is whether the company can do that every year. — Peter Eavis The streaming music service filed its prospectus for a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange, an unusual route that bypasses the traditional initial public offering process. Direct listings essentially move trading in a company’s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market. Advertisement Wall Street and Silicon Valley will watch Spotify’s listing closely. If it goes well, it could spur other high profile start-ups to pursue a direct listing. Wall Street bankers are unlikely to cheer such a development. Direct listings generate lower fees than the typical I.P.O. Spotify won’t embark on its roadshow, a series of meetings with investor ahead of the listing, for at least 15 days. Here’s a look at the details: Ticker symbol: SPOT Price range for private shares in 2017:  $37.50-$125.00  Price range for private shares this year:  $90.00-$132.50 Valuation range in 2017: $6.3 billion to $20.9 billion Valuation range this year: $15.9 billion to $23.4 billion Valuation based on the midpoint of its 2018 price range: $19.7 billion Loss: €1.2 billion in 2017, up from €225 million in 2015 Operating loss: €378 million, compared with €235 million in 2015. Revenue: €4.1 billion last year, up from €1.9 billion in 2015. Free cash flow: €109 million in 2017 Ebitda: -€324 million in 2017 Monthly average users: 159 million last year, up from 91 million in 2015 Premium subscribers: 71 million, up from 28 million in 2015 Share of global streaming music market: 42 percent Advertisement The amount Spotify has paid in royalties to record labels since its inception: More than $8 billion Percent of total voting power controlled by co-founder and chief executive, Daniel Ek: 37.3 percent Percent of total voting power controlled by co-founder, Martin Lorentzon: 43.1 percent Risks of a direct listing: “Our ability to sell your ordinary shares at or above the price you bought them for due to (i) our listing not having the same safeguards as an underwritten initial public offering, which may result in the public price of our ordinary shares being volatile and declining significantly upon listing, or (ii) the failure of an active, liquid, and orderly market for our ordinary shares to develop or be sustained.” Despite a sharp selloff in financial markets in early February, the market for public offerings started 2018 with a bang. Through late February, 30 companies publicly listed their shares on markets in the United States, raising $11.4 billion from investors. That was the strongest annual start for the market since 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters. The pipeline of listings to come is also strong. On top of Spotify’s listing, which should come in the next few weeks, Dropbox filed paperwork last week to go public. One of the U.S.’s biggest gun sellers, Dick’s Sporting Goods, said that it would stop selling assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines, as well as limit sales of any gun to those 21 and older. In doing so, the retailer is steering directly into the controversy that has embroiled companies that have taken on the American gun lobby. Dick’s C.E.O., Edward Stack, told the NYT: “When we saw what happened in Parkland, we were so disturbed and upset. We love these kids and their rallying cry, ‘enough is enough.’ It got to us.” What’s next: Mr. Stack wants what he calls “common sense” changes to gun laws, like the steps his company is taking and broader universal background checks. Advertisement Why it’s remarkable:  Other companies, big and small, continue to sever ties to the National Rifle Association. Delta has been openly dressed down — and potentially punished — by Republicans in Georgia after eliminating discounts for N.R.A. members. (Gun control is certainly a hot topic in the midterm election campaign.) And then there’s this: FedEx and UPS are feuding over ties to the N.R.A. Over five years ago, Bill Ackman boldly announced that he was shorting Herbalife, declaring the company a pyramid scheme and vowing to see its stock price down to zero. Today, Mr. Ackman finally gave up on that quest. The Pershing Square Capital Management chief told CNBC that his firm had finally exited the short bet. That’s after: • Mr. Ackman’s frenemy, Dan Loeb, took the other side of that bet. • So did Carl Icahn, in one of the most prominent public spats in recent Wall Street history, before the two men made up. (That didn’t stop Mr. Icahn from continuing to bet on Herbalife.) How did Herbalife investors respond Wednesday? They pushed shares in the company up 8.5 percent to $94.04, an all-time high. But Mr. Ackman has found a new investment: United Technologies. Why? The hedge fund mogul told CNBC that he liked the company — which happens to be considering spinning off parts of itself as a way to get more value for the conglomerate’s shareholders. Shares in United Technologies were up 2.1 percent this afternoon, at $136.73. — Michael de la Merced For months, the former real estate investor’s inability to get a permanent top-secret security clearance has been a lightning rod for criticism. Now his interim credentials have been docked to secret and his West Wing portfolio clipped — and people are asking what happened. Advertisement One thing that has come up, per the WaPo, citing unidentified U.S. officials: Officials in China, Israel, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates have discussed how to manipulate him by taking advantage of his business dealings and complicated finances. Speaking of the Kushner business: It’s is in talks to buy Vornado out of 666 Fifth Ave., the troubled Manhattan skyscraper that the two own, according to the WSJ. Critics will ask, where would the money come from? Is it scaring off users? So far the answer seems to be no. CNBC reports Snap’s download rates have remained strong, according to App Annie. And Snap’s shares are up 5 percent. Background Snap’s redesign, which has been rolling out over the past few months, has faced growing criticism from users and weighed on the stock. Last week a tweet from Kylie Jenner, saying she did not open Snapchat, sent the stock tumbling 6 percent. Wall Street has picked up on the customer backlash and a couple of analysts have downgraded the stock. The criticism has also overshadowed Snap’s positive fourth-quarter results earlier this month that pushed its shares up nearly 50 percent. BlackRock thinks that could be a risk to its business. From the risk factors in BlackRock’s annual report: As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of third-party commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing, as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries, known as “common ownership”. The commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows, create stock price bubbles, or conversely, exacerbate a decline in market prices. The filing goes on to say: If the conclusions advanced by such commentators were to gain traction or result in the enactment of policy measures that place limits on asset managers, BlackRock’s business operations, reputation or financial condition may be adversely affected. That is how John D. Herrmann, an analyst who covers the bond markets for MUFG Securities Americas, reacted to the testimony in Congress of Jerome Powell. In a note to clients yesterday, Mr. Herrmann cataloged upbeat remarks that Mr. Powell made, and observed that Mr. Powell seemed optimistic not just about the current economic environment, but also the outlook for the next three to four years. What to make of Wall Street’s response to Mr. Powell? One interpretation is that Mr. Powell wants investors and others to be more prepared for higher interest rates. Wall Street seems to have settled on a scenario in which the Fed raises interest rates steadily over the next two years. Any sign that rates may rise much more quickly than expected could cause a panicky pullback in the financial markets, which could ultimately harm the economy. Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . To help prevent that, Fed officials can say things aimed at prompting investors to give more consideration to certain outcomes. Advertisement Is it working?  Arguably, if investors were more concerned, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note would be higher than the 2.88 percent it traded at on Wednesday morning. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is forecasting the 10-year Treasury yield will be 3.25 percent at the end of this year. Anyone surprised that the yield gets there far more quickly should not be after Mr. Powell’s testimony. — Peter Eavis • Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has floated the idea of rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, more than a year after President Trump walked away.

(NYT) It’s because the British satellite broadcaster Sky — which Comcast and 21st Century Fox are poised to fight over — is a smaller example of what U.S. telecom giants want to become. More from Stu Woo of the WSJ: Sky is both a telecom operator — selling TV, internet and phone services — and a media company with its own original news, sports and entertainment programming. And Sky has reach beyond the U.K. market. It is a Pan-European operation, with businesses in Britain, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. It’s also probably because everyone is worried about Netflix. Critics’ corner: Investors are right to expect a bidding war, according to Chris Hughes of Gadfly.
