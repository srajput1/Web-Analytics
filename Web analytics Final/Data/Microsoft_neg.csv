 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc elected three independent directors to its board, including executives from Microsoft Corp and Aviva, the world's biggest asset manager said on Thursday. The new directors are Bill Ford, the CEO of private equity firm General Atlantic, Peggy Johnson, the executive vice president of business development at Microsoft, and British insurer Aviva's Chief Executive Mark Wilson. ""The three new directors' global perspective and combined expertise in technology, financial services and fast-growing markets, such as Asia-Pacific, reflects BlackRock's current and future priorities,"" the company said in a statement. With the additions, BlackRock's board now has 20 directors, of whom five are women. The appointments come months after BlackRock CEO Larry Fink expressed the need for greater workplace diversity, saying his firm would have to hire more women. Separately on Thursday, Goldman Sachs announced a push to have women represent half of its global workforce over time, as the Wall Street bank looks to accelerate its workplace diversity efforts.

 NEW YORK — Wall Street's major indexes fell on Tuesday as the dismissal of U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the possibility of additional U.S. import tariffs against China dragged down stocks across sectors. President Donald Trump fired Tillerson after a series of public rifts over issues including North Korea and Russia. Trump has appointed CIA Director Mike Pompeo, seen as loyal to the president, to replace Tillerson. To lead the CIA, the president has tapped Gina Haspel, the agency's deputy director. ""Any time there's change, investors get nervous,"" said John Carey, portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. ""They have to go back to the drawing board to figure out what the implications might be."" Still, Carey said, at least the nominees to lead the State Department and the CIA are familiar names. Advertisement ""I don't think either change will be troubling to the market as people reflect on the qualifications of the people stepping into the roles,"" he said. Advertisement U.S. stocks added to losses after Politico reported that a package of tariffs targeting $30 billion a year in Chinese imports could be rolled out as soon as next week. ""This may be upsetting the apple cart,"" said Bryan Novak, senior managing director at Astor Investment Management in Chicago. ""When you look at tariffs, you don't just look in a vacuum. You look at what follows on top of (them). It's worth watching a bit more, to see the follow-through on our side and their side, but there could be some anxiety around it."" The markets had opened higher after data showed U.S. consumer price growth slowed in February, an indication that an anticipated pickup in inflation probably will be only gradual. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 171.58 points, or 0.68 percent, to 25,007.03, the S&P 500 lost 17.71 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,765.31 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 77.31 points, or 1.02 percent, to 7,511.01.  . Tech and financial stocks were the biggest laggards among the S&P 500's 11 major sectors. Shares of Microsoft Corp, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc fell between 1.5 percent and 2.4 percent. ""Technology rallied hard yesterday and last week, and there is profit-taking, but it's just a short-term pressure,"" said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities in New York. Financial stocks were weighed as U.S. Treasury yields fell in response to the CPI data and Tillerson's exit. Among individual stocks, General Electric Co fell 4.4 percent after J.P.

 FRANKFURT/BERLIN —  German software giant SAP on Tuesday said operating margins hit bottom last year and will begin to arc up this year and rise further through 2020 and beyond, as profitability improves in its internet-based cloud business. Speaking to investors in New York, SAP executives also detailed moves to make it easier for customers to run SAP business planning tools via low-cost Amazon, Google or Microsoft cloud servers or in SAP's own datacenters, allowing it to pare back its capital spending. Chief Financial Officer Luka Mucic told the company's annual capital markets day event that easing up on heavy investments to switch customers to cloud-based software would help margins rise to 29.8 percent in 2018 and reach around 30.7 percent by 2020, with further improvements into the next decade. SAP had reported margins troughing at 28.9 percent in 2017. Board member and products chief Bernd Leukert said the company would let customers interchangeably run their software on SAP datacenters or on public cloud services. The executives' comments were monitored by Reuters via webcast. Advertisement SAP plans to shut down 18 of its 45 datacenters by the end of 2019, as more customers switch to public cloud services, a faster pace than the 10 datacenters it closed in the last two to three years. Advertisement Leukert also said that consolidating a string of cloud software acquisitions running on separate platforms, each separately maintained, onto a single, common platform would be completed by the end of 2018, further shaving costs.  . He said SAP had elected to harmonise its own company-run datacenters by standardising Google as its preferred ""go-to"" infrastructure. ""There is no difference any more running in Google or on SAP infrastructure,"" he said.

 WASHINGTON — As the United States and China look to protect their national security needs and economic interests, the fight between the two financial superpowers is increasingly focused on a single area: technology. The clash erupted in public on Tuesday after the United States government, citing national security concerns, called for a full investigation into a hostile bid to buy the American chip stalwart Qualcomm — a review that is often a death knell for a corporate deal. The proposed acquisition by the Singapore-based Broadcom would have been the largest deal in technology history, creating a major force in the development of the computer chips that power smartphones and many internet-connected devices. But a government panel said the takeover could weaken Qualcomm and give its Chinese rivals an advantage. “China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover,” a United States Treasury official wrote in a letter calling for a review of the deal. Advertisement The fight over technology is redefining the rules of engagement in an era when national security and economic power are closely intertwined. Advertisement China, under President Xi Jinping, has launched an ambitious plan to dominate mobile technology, supercomputers, artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge industries, putting huge resources behind an effort that it considers crucial to the country’s government, military and economy. Beijing wants to build its own technology champions and is encouraging companies to acquire the engineering, expertise and intellectual property from big rivals in the United States and elsewhere. The aggressive push has set off alarms in Washington, with policymakers and lawmakers fearful that American giants could lose their edge. President Trump is now building up the country’s defenses, as the government investigates potential violations of American intellectual property rights and intensifies scrutiny of overseas deals. The secretive panel that is reviewing the Qualcomm deal, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, has taken on a central role in the resistance to Chinese investment. The panel, which is led by the Treasury Department and made up of representatives from multiple agencies, has the authority to block foreign acquisitions of American companies for national security reasons; it has effectively killed several acquisitions linked to Chinese buyers over the past year. Lawmakers are also calling to expand the powers of Cfius to reflect the broader scope of China’s interests. [ What is Cfius? It is the “ultimate regulatory bazooka,” according to an executive who works on mergers and acquisitions. Read more about the panel here » ] “The Trump administration turbocharged it,” Tony Balloon, the head of the corporate China practice at the law firm Alston & Bird, said, referring to Cfius. “There is now a recognition in government that foreign investors, particularly from China, are getting more and more sophisticated on how they get access to technology in the U.S.” With Qualcomm, the government has articulated its evolving vision for global economic leadership. The company, which is a major supplier to the United States government, is a leading player in the race to build the next generation wireless technology, known as 5G. These high-speed mobile networks will form the infrastructure backbone that ultimately connects home appliances, streetlights and driverless cars to the internet. And Qualcomm’s chips will be in the multitude of devices and machines that will run on those networks. “Having a well-known and trusted company hold the dominant role that Qualcomm does in the telecommunications infrastructure provides significant confidence in the integrity of such infrastructure as it relates to national security,” the Treasury official wrote in the letter. The government specifically cited Huawei, the Chinese telecom-equipment giant, as a potential competitor that could move into a breach created by a merger. The Chinese company has spent heavily on 5G, and the government said it owns 10 percent of the essential patents. Advertisement “It is the new paradigm,” said Paul Triolo, head of global technology policy at Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consulting company. “That implies technologies with 5G, artificial intelligence, biotech and automation are now considered more sensitive and part of a national innovation base that needs to be protected.” Broadcom said it was cooperating with Cfius, saying it was “making the combined company a global leader in critical 5G and other technologies.” Qualcomm, in an earlier statement, said the review was a “very serious matter.”  . The letter and the call for an investigation reflect the newly forceful position of Cfius. In most cases, the panel weighs in after a deal is announced. With Qualcomm, Cfius is taking a proactive role and investigating before an acquisition agreement has even been signed. Cfius has stymied several deals in the past year. MoneyGram, the money transfer company, and Ant Financial, the Chinese electronics payment company, called off their merger in January, citing regulatory concerns of Cfius. If the deal had gone through, Ant Financial would have had access to reams of financial data, which could have created security problems. Ant Financial has said that consumer data would have stayed in the United States. Last year, the White House blocked a Chinese-backed investor from buying Lattice Semiconductor, which is a supplier to the United States government. China Venture Capital Fund Corporation, which was part of the investment group, is owned by state-backed entities. “It’s very much an expansion of what is considered to be national security,” said Tai Ming Cheung, director of the Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation at the University of California at San Diego. “This is about China’s efforts to invest and acquire key parts of the U.S. innovation system.” Cfius could soon have even more muscle. There is new legislation to broaden the jurisdiction of Cfius; it has bipartisan support in the Senate. The Trump administration has expressed support for rewriting the rules governing Cfius, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said last year that the administration was working closely with the House and the Senate. The bill, proposed by Senators John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, and Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California, would give Cfius the authority to assess some types of joint ventures, minority investments and real estate transactions near military bases. The legislation would also widen the definition of “critical technologies” slated for potential review to include “emerging technologies that could be essential for maintaining the U.S. technological advantage over countries that pose threats, such as China,” according to a news release on the bill. Adding to the scrutiny, the United States Trade Representative has also opened an investigation into whether China is “harming American intellectual property rights, innovation or technology development.” One concern is that American companies have been forced to hand over technology, create joint ventures and otherwise help homegrown players, in exchange for access to the Chinese market. Qualcomm, for example, has been working with the Chinese government to develop drones, artificial intelligence and mobile technology. Advertisement Technology companies are stuck in the middle of the fight between the United States and China. While there are concerns about Chinese encroachment, the industry also recognizes that such deals are the price for entry to the world’s second-largest economy. Companies have protested the proposed changes to Cfius, saying an expansion of its powers could be misused and that the new definitions of emerging technologies are unclear. IBM has said the bill would limit the “ability of American firms to do business abroad while empowering foreign competitors to capture global markets.” The Information Technology Industry Council, a tech trade group, has lobbied against the changes, saying they add complexity for Silicon Valley companies that often have intricate business ties in China. “They are between a rock and a hard place,” said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank that is sponsored by technology firms like Microsoft. “The Chinese government says you have to do this to operate here. The U.S. says, but you can’t do that.” Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from London.

 SAN FRANCISCO —  The Nasdaq blasted through a record high on Friday as traders looking to ride recent momentum piled into Microsoft, Netflix, Amazon.com and other high-performance technology names. The rise came alongside a broad rally in the market. The S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose sharply - up 1.5 percent - as February's jobs report assuaged fears of inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes. The gains came nine years to the day since the bull market began. Microsoft, Apple and Amazon each rose more than 1 percent and hit or closely approached all-time highs, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index surged 1.8 percent to its own record. Those stock moves helped push the Nasdaq Composite Index up 1.4 percent to 7,532 points, which is about a third of a percent higher than its previous all-time high on Jan 26. Advertisement The Nasdaq and the S&P 500, also up about 1.4 percent, were both helped by employment data that tempered fears of faster interest rate increases. Advertisement There was no major news specifically related to the tech sector driving its gains. Netflix jumped 3.6 percent, also hitting a record high and bringing the video streaming service's gain in the past year to 65 percent. ""You look at tech and think, 'What is the catalyst that's going to bring it down?' I don't see one in the short term, and that makes me confident as a trader to go into those stocks that have been the leaders,"" said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC.  . Technology stocks have been widely viewed in recent months as a ""crowded trade,"" a situation where most investors have the same opinion, increasing the potential for a volatile selloff if sentiment changes. For example, Bank of Montreal in January launched an exchange traded fund aiming to triple the return of 10 stocks, including the so-called FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix Inc and Google parent Alphabet. Large cap active fund managers recently trimmed their relative weight in technology stocks to 1.18 times the broader market, down from 1.23 last month, giving up to discretionary stocks its position as the most crowded sector, according to a recent report from Bank of America. The Nasdaq is up 9 percent year to date, compared to a 3 percent increase in S&P 500, which has yet to recover from a February selloff sparked by fears of higher interest rates.

 Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching: • The markets and Trump’s tariffs. • Jared Kushner is criticized for meetings with business moguls who later helped his family’s company. • Stephen Schwarzman had a good 2017. • Walmart is the latest business to wade into the gun debate. • And Spotify opens its books ahead of its direct listing. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Investors might be tempted to take a trade skirmish in stride. When President George W. Bush slapped high tariffs on steel imports 16 years ago, the stock market slipped a bit but recovered in the following days. Likewise, stocks may bounce back from the decline that followed the news on Thursday that President Trump will soon introduce tariffs on steel and aluminum. Advertisement In recent years, the global economic order appeared to be under threat a number of times. But stock markets rebounded from Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, Europe’s sovereign debt crisis, and the debt-ceiling clashes in the United States. Advertisement And there is a good chance that President Trump’s tariffs won’t cause a great deal of collateral economic damage. They may end up being softer than Thursday’s headlines suggest, as globalists push back. And like President Bush’s tariffs, President Trump’s may be quite narrow in focus and exist for a relatively short period. Investors could learn to live with those, just as they’ve mostly shrugged off possible changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement. But vulnerabilities exist right now that could magnify any negative impact of President Trump’s tariffs. The stock market is still highly valued after a searing rally that took it to an all-time high in January. The Federal Reserve expects to increase interest rates multiple times this year. Compare that with March 2002, when President Bush introduced his trade restrictions: The Fed was cutting interest rates, a policy stance that can help support the economy and the stock market; stocks were nowhere near their peak of two years earlier; and President Bush’s administration was, overall, globalist in its outlook and didn’t want to become isolated ahead of the Iraq war. Importantly, the United States economy is less dominant than it was 16 years ago. Last year, the United States accounted for an estimated 24 percent of the world’s gross domestic product, using data from the International Monetary Fund. In 2002, the share was 32 percent. If other countries retaliate, and tariffs broaden, the United States’ economy may be less resilient than some in the Trump administration may believe. — Peter Eavis We asked yesterday if his family’s real estate business was his biggest liability. Our colleagues’ latest story shows that might be the case. What happened • Josh Harris of Apollo Global Management, an adviser on infrastructure issues, met with Mr. Kushner several times last year. In November, Apollo lent $184 million to Kushner Companies, triple the size of the investment firm’s average property loan. • Citigroup’s C.E.O., Michael Corbat, met with Mr. Kushner in the spring, and shortly afterward the bank lent Kushner Companies $325 million. Advertisement Mr. Kushner, his family business, Apollo and Citi all said that nothing improper had happened. But the meetings raise questions about how the Kushner Companies is weighing down the political fortunes of President Trump’s son-in-law. Mr. Kushner has already had his interim security clearance downgraded amid a feud with the White House chief of staff, John Kelly. The WSJ editorial board writes, “Mr. Kushner and Ivanka have to decide if they’d serve themselves and the president better by walking away from their formal White House roles.” The politics flyaround • The White House is set to announce new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, according to unidentified sources. (Bloomberg) • Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and one of Mr. Trump’s closest aides, plans to step down. (NYT) • Mr. Trump publicly criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions as “DISGRACEFUL” for not ordering his own investigation into the handling of the Russia inquiry. (NYT) From Ana Swanson of the NYT: President Trump said on Thursday that he will impose stiff and sweeping tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum as he moved to fulfill a key campaign promise to get tough on foreign competitors. Mr. Trump said he would formally sign the trade measures next week and promised they would be in effect “for a long period of time.” The trade measures would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. It is unclear whether those would apply to all imports or be targeted toward specific countries, like China, which have been flooding the United States with cheap metals. The announcement capped a frenetic and chaotic morning inside the White House as Mr. Trump summoned more than a dozen executives from the steel and aluminum industry to the White House, raising expectations that he would announce his long-promised tariffs. However, the legal review of the trade measure was not yet complete and, as of Thursday morning, White House advisers were still discussing various scenarios for tariff levels and which countries could be included, according to people familiar with the deliberations. U.S. stock markets slipped around the time Mr. Trump made his comments about tariffs, with declines in the industrial sector outpacing the overall market. The Standard & Poor’s 500 industrial sector was down more than 2 percent, compared to the overall benchmark index which was down a bit less than 1 percent as of around 1:30 p.m. Automakers, large consumers of steel and aluminum, fell sharply. Another large consumer of those materials, aircraft maker Boeing also declined. As the country’s largest exporter, Boeing would also likely be affected by rising global trade tensions if other nations responded to tariffs from the United States. The comments also come on the same day as Bill Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve, said this about protectionism: “There are many approaches to dealing with the costs of globalization, but protectionism is a dead end. Trade restrictions address the symptoms and not the underlying problems, and they introduce other costs and distortions. While such measures might generate a temporary boost to growth from greater domestic production and consumption, these would likely be offset by a range of other costs. Over time, such measures would retard productivity growth and thereby shrink the economic pie.” The co-founder and chief executive of Blackstone raked in $786.5 million last year, his biggest take-home ever, according to Bloomberg. His stake in New York-based Blackstone—and the $661 million in dividends it yielded—fueled much of the payout. The rest came from his cut of deal profits, salary and other compensation, according to the filing. In 2016, Schwarzman got $425 million. By comparison • Apollo’s Leon Black took home $191.3 million • Carlyle co-founders David Rubenstein, Bill Conway and Dan D’Aniello divvied up a combined payout of $193 million. Advertisement • KKR’s Henry Kravis and George Roberts received a combined $343 million. Jerome Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, said before the Senate Banking Committee: “We don’t see any strong evidence yet of a decisive move up in wages. We see wages by a couple of measures trending up a little bit, but most of them continuing to grow at two and a half percent. Nothing is suggesting to me that wage inflation is at a point of accelerating. I would expect that some continued strengthening in the labor market can take place without causing inflation.” Context Mr. Powell said the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday that the outlook for the United States economy had brightened in recent months. He added that the Fed expected to continue raising rates gradually and could even pick up the pace. The markets seemed to interpret the remarks as signaling the Fed would be more aggressive than expected in raising rates. But there was more evidence Thursday morning that inflation may accelerate this year.  Here are the  numbers from the Commerce Department: • Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 0.4 percent. • That was the biggest increase since September.In the 12 months through January, the PCE price index rose 1.7 percent. • So-called core PCE, which excludes food and energy, the PCE advanced 0.3 percent in January — the largest gain since January 2017. • Year-over-year core PCE, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, rose at 1.5 percent in January. • The core PCE price index has undershot the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target since mid-2012. Just as the company isn’t holding a traditional I.P.O., it isn’t holding the usual kind of marketing road show either. On March 15, the music streaming giant will — what else? — live-stream a presentation for potential investors. Here’s what to expect, from the company’s prospectus: We will prepare an electronic presentation for this investor day, which will have content similar to a traditional roadshow presentation, and make one version of the presentation publicly available, without restriction, on a website. There can be no guarantees that the investor day and other investor education meetings will have the same impact on investor education as a traditional “roadshow” conducted in connection with an underwritten initial public offering. Spotify adds that it will hold additional “investor education meetings,” which would likely be reserved for the most important investors. Advertisement While traditional I.P.O.s generally post video versions of their road show presentations on sites like RetailRoadShow, the company looks like it’s trying something different. — Michael de la Merced DoorDash, the food delivery startup, raised $535 billion from a group of investors led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund and that included Sequoia Capital and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund. The amount is almost triple what the company had raised in the last five years, Bloomberg reported and values the company at $1.4 billion. Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . DoorDash uses a courier model popularized by Uber, meaning that it sends independent contractors to pick up and deliver orders. The company said it has partnered with nearly 90 percent of the top 100 restaurant chains, including Wendy’s, Chick-Fil-A, IHOP, PF Chang’s, the Cheesecake Factory and Five Guys. It was one thing for Dick’s Sporting Goods to set an age requirement for firearms sales. It’s another for the country’s biggest gun seller to do something similar. What each is doing: Walmart: Raising the minimum age for purchases of guns or ammunition to 21, and eliminating products that look like assault-style rifles. (The company stopped selling AR-15s two years ago.) Dick’s: Requiring buyers to be at least 21 and dropping AR-15s from its 35 Field and Stream outlets. The NYT notes that Walmart explicitly linked the new rules to the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. The company said in its statement, “In light of recent events, we’ve taken an opportunity to review our policy on firearm sales.” The gun control debate remains a tricky one to navigate, though more C.E.O.s feel compelled to speak up. Michael Dowling of Northwell Health told the WSJ, “We are people that other people look up to.” A caveat: While some capitalist activists are urging big mutual funds to sell stocks in gun companies, Stephen Gandel of Gadfly argues that such divestment campaigns don’t work.

(FT) The hedge fund mogul finally called quits on his five-year campaign against the supplements company Herbalife, which he called a pyramid scheme and whose stock he once declared would go down to zero. A look back at the famous short bet, from Matthew Goldstein of the NYT: In the annals of Wall Street, investors have lost more on trades. But Mr. Ackman’s bearish bet on Herbalife was a signature event given how much time, effort and money he devoted to making his case — all in the hopes that the federal authorities would take action against Herbalife. Herbalife’s shares closed yesterday at $92.10, a record high. Memories: Herbalife was at the center of Mr. Ackman’s infamous televised debate with Carl Icahn, who was (and still is) betting on the company’s ability to grow. Where Mr. Ackman is focused now: United Technologies, the subject of rumors that the conglomerate may break itself up. Brooke Sutherland of Gadfly applauded the back-to-activism-basics bet.

David Rubenstein, the Carlyle Group co-founder, told CNBC at the SuperReturn conference in Berlin that, over all, businesses support the White House’s economic policies: “I think there are some things the administration has done that the business community will not like, but generally I think the administration has pleased the business community and other people as well.” Why? Largely the tax cuts, for which both Republicans and Democrats are compiling data  to support their political arguments.

More from Jean Eaglesham and Paul Vigna of the WSJ: The S.E.C. scrutiny is focused in part on “simple agreements for future tokens,” or SAFTs, which are used in some of the most prominent crypto-fundraisings, according to the people familiar with the matter. The agreements allow big investors and relatively well-off individuals to buy rights to tokens ahead of their sale. The rights can be traded, or flipped for profits, even before the sale begins.
