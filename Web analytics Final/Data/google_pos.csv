 (Reuters) - Online platforms such as Google, Apple and Amazon face new European Union rules on their commercial practices with smaller businesses that use their services, as Brussels seeks to curtail their huge market power. The European Commission is drafting a new regulation specifically targeting online platforms such as e-commerce sites, app stores and search engines that will require the companies to be more transparent about how they rank search results and why they delist some services. The proposal seeks to address potentially harmful trading practices by online platforms and a lack of effective redress mechanisms for smaller businesses that use them to reach consumers. ""Online intermediation services can hold superior bargaining power over their business users, enabling them to behave unilaterally in a way that is capable of harming the businesses using them,"" the draft regulation, seen by Reuters, says. Advertisement Tech companies have faced significant regulatory pressure from Brussels, be it over their handling of swathes of user data, how much they pay in taxes or the proliferation of extremist content on social media. Advertisement The proposal was initially meant to exclude search engines such as Alphabet Inc's Google and Microsoft's Bing, but these will now be included given the impact a business's ranking in search results can have on its revenues. The EU's antitrust chief in June hit Google with a record 2.42 billion euro ($2.99 billion) fine for favoring its own shopping service over those of rivals.  . Under the proposal, operators of search engines, app stores as well as e-commerce sites such as eBay will have to specify upfront the ""most important parameters determining ranking"", such as ""specific signals incorporated into algorithms"" and adjustment or demotion mechanisms. The proposal will not force companies to disclose their algorithms but just provide descriptions at a general level explaining ""how and to what extent the relevant ranking mechanism takes account of the quality of the products and services offered"". Online platforms will also have to implement a notice period of at least 15 days for changes to their terms and conditions as well as provide businesses with an ""individualized"" description of the reasons for which they have been de-listed or suspended - for example from Apple's App Store or Google Play. Where companies have their own services competing with other businesses on their platforms - for example Google's own comparison shopping service in Google search results - their terms and conditions will have to include a description of any preferential treatment they give to their own service including access to consumer data and ranking. The proposal is expected to be published in April, after which it will have to be agreed by national governments and the European Parliament.

 The path to fast and affordable online grocery service is littered with obstacles: refrigeration challenges, storage woes and high transportation costs, among others. But the country’s largest retailers are convinced that it will lead to a lucrative and largely untapped market. And they are all rushing to dominate it first. Walmart escalated the competition on Wednesday by announcing plans to expand its online grocery delivery service to 100 metropolitan areas by the end of the year. Orders will be fulfilled at more than 800 stores nationwide and shuttled to shoppers by drivers contracted through Uber, Deliv and other ride and delivery platforms. Customers must order at least $30 worth of goods and pay an additional delivery fee of $9.95; they can receive their purchases in as little as four hours if they put in the request by 1 p.m. The plan puts the world’s largest retailer on a direct collision course with the world’s most powerful e-commerce player, Amazon, which purchased the Whole Foods grocery chain for $13.4 billion last summer and recently announced plans to use those stores to fill on-demand orders. Advertisement Other retailers like Costco, Target and Kroger are also joining the increasingly expensive battle for customers who want eggs and milk without leaving their couch. Advertisement “There is a lot of experimenting going on as everyone tries to figure out that last-mile delivery — it’s a tough economic equation to make work,” said Mike Knemeyer, a professor of logistics at Ohio State University. “But if you can, you’ll have a big head start on the others, and you’ll end up making money not just in groceries but on all of the things that you sell.” The nexus of e-commerce and grocery sales is increasingly appealing to retailers. “The thing that’s great about grocery is that it’s a pure traffic driver — no matter who you are, you need to get groceries every two weeks, which makes it an exception from all the other categories that keep retailers up at night,” said Matt Sargent, a retail expert at the consulting firm Magid. But while the total grocery market is enormous — nearly $1 trillion annually in the United States — many customers still insist on seeing and touching their food in person before buying. Spending on online groceries is currently just $27 billion a year, or 3 percent of the total, according to Forrester Research, which specializes in technology. Controlling costs is another major challenge. Grocery providers have grappled with the expense of packaging delicate produce and meats in ice packs and dispatching fleets of company-owned vehicles from distribution centers staffed around the clock. Even Amazon has struggled. The company launched its AmazonFresh service in the Seattle area in 2007 and tested it for years before expanding it to more than 20 cities. Customers pay $14.99 a month — in addition to their $99-a-year Prime membership — to have groceries sent directly to them. But late last year, the company decided to pull AmazonFresh from some markets. “There’s no question that online grocery has been a challenge for everyone, including Amazon,” said Sucharita Kodali, an analyst at Forrester. “The reason is it’s just really, really hard to get the last mile going.” But Amazon touched off a flurry of activity with its acquisition of Whole Foods in June. In October, Costco introduced a two-day delivery option for dry groceries and a same-day program for fresh goods through Instacart, a delivery service. Target said in December that it would purchase the online same-day delivery service Shipt for $550 million in cash. Advertisement Amazon, which has several brick-and-mortar grocery options in Seattle, said this month that it had begun to offer same-day delivery of groceries from Whole Foods in six cities and would expand the program to the rest of the country later this year. The program is run through Amazon’s Prime Now service, which relies on contractors to make deliveries in their personal cars within two hours of an order being placed. The service is free to Prime customers, but Amazon automatically adds an optional tip. Kroger soon followed Amazon’s lead with an announcement that it would expand the number of cities eligible for home delivery of groceries through Instacart. Walmart’s Sam’s Club division, which said last month it would offer members free shipping of online orders for an annual $100 fee, also uses Instacart. But Walmart said that it would not tap Instacart for the grocery delivery program at its Walmart stores, which it said would reach more than 40 percent of American households. “We’re saving customers time by leveraging new technology, and connecting all the parts of our business into a single seamless shopping experience: great stores, easy pickup, fast delivery, and apps and websites that are simple to use,” Greg Foran, the chief executive of Walmart U.S., said in a statement.  . The company has made substantial investments in its growing suite of online offerings, including a partnership with Google to sell Walmart products on Google Express and the creation of Store No. 8, an internal venture to help develop new online businesses. In the fall, Walmart bought Parcel, a 24-hour delivery service that uses algorithms and leased vehicles to send perishable and nonperishable products to customers in New York City. On Wednesday, Walmart also reiterated that it planned to expand its curbside grocery pickup service to 1,000 more locations this year, in addition to the 1,200 locations where it is already offered. The service allows customers to order food online and collect it at Walmart stores. But Walmart’s e-commerce success has sometimes been fickle — its online sales increased 23 percent in its most recent quarter, less than half the rate of growth in each of the previous three quarters and a performance that sent a ripple of nervousness through the stock market. 
            How customers of some major grocery retailers said they used online ordering.         MARCH 14, 2018
 Walmart’s expanded delivery service requires that customers visit the company’s website or grocery app to place orders. The chain will then have one of its 18,000 personal shoppers collect the selected items in stores. Advertisement Each of those employees — along with the thousands more that Walmart said it would add this year — undergoes a three-week training program that teaches them how to pick the best meats and produce. As specialists, they are paid more than the company’s entry-level workers. Beefing up its grocery delivery service is an “informed gamble” for Walmart, Mr. Knemeyer said — one that will most likely serve up side benefits such as data collection and inroads with young, affluent city dwellers. The chain, long known as a discount retailer, has lately been trying to broaden its appeal. It spent $3.3 billion acquiring Jet.com, a bulk online retailer that Walmart said would give it access to “urban and millennial customers.” In 2017, it purchased the hip e-commerce brands Bonobos and ModCloth. Last month, it unveiled what it called an “Instagram-worthy” collection of mattresses and bedding, available through a separate website. But the supercenters for which Walmart is best known tend to exist on the outskirts of cities and in rural areas. Breaking into metropolitan grocery ecosystems, which often support an already robust network of delivery services for grocery chains and restaurants alike, could be difficult, experts said. And the feature of groceries that make them so attractive to retailers — they are regularly consumed and so must be regularly replenished — makes most consumers unwilling to splurge on them. Walmart’s $9.95 fee on each order is a much more visible cost to consumers compared to Amazon’s annual $99 fee for its Prime membership, which many shoppers set to auto-pay and then forget. “They probably just look at the relatively high delivery fee and get scared off,” said Matthias Winkenbach, director of M.I.T.’s Megacity Logistics Lab. “Walmart would have to do a very good job communicating the overall economics of shopping their everyday low prices versus Amazon.” Follow Tiffany Hsu and Nick Wingfield on Twitter: @TiffkHsu and @NickWingfield.

 (Reuters) - Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google corporate brands dropped in an annual survey while Amazon.com Inc maintained the top spot for the third consecutive year, and electric carmaker Telsa Inc rocketed higher after sending a red Roadster into space. IPhone maker Apple dropped to 29th from its previous position of No. 5, and Google dropped from 8th to No. 28. Apple had ranked No. 2 as recently as 2016, according to the annual Harris Poll Reputation Quotient poll released on Tuesday. The poll, conducted since 1999, surveyed 25,800 U.S. adults from Dec. 11 to Jan. 12 on the reputations the ""most visible"" corporate brands. John Gerzema, CEO of the Harris Poll, told Reuters in an interview that the likely reason Apple and Google fell was that they have not introduced as many attention-grabbing products as they did in past years, such as when Google rolled out free offerings like its Google Docs word processor or Google Maps and Apple's then-CEO Steve Jobs introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad. Advertisement ""Google and Apple, at this moment, are sort of in valleys,"" Gerzema said. ""We're not quite to self-driving cars yet. We're not yet seeing all the things in artificial intelligence they're going to do."" Advertisement Meanwhile, Amazon.com held on to the No. 1 spot, which it has held for five years with the exception of 2015, when it slipped to No. 2. Gerzema attributed Amazon's ranking to its expanding footprint in consumers' lives into areas like groceries via its Whole Foods acquisition. Elon Musk's Tesla climbed from No. 9 to No. 3 on the strength of sending Tesla Roadster into space aboard a SpaceX rocket - despite fleeting success delivering cars on time on earth, Gerzema said.  . ""He's a modern-day carnival barker - it's incredible,"" Gerzema said of Musk. ""This 'The Right Stuff' attitude is able to capture the public's imagination when every news headline is incredibly negative. They're filling a void of optimism."" For its part, Facebook Inc's reputation improved in the 2018 study, despite being the target of questions from U.S. lawmakers about the role of social media in Russia's efforts to influence the U.S. presidential election in 2016. Facebook ranked 51st, its best showing since 2014 when it ranked 38th, the highest the firm ever ranked in the poll. This year, film production company The Weinstein Co made its debut at 99th out of 100 on the list after more than 70 women accused co-founder Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, including rape. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

 WASHINGTON —  First lady Melania Trump is bringing together tech giants to talk about ways to fight cyberbullying and promote internet safety, representatives of three companies said Tuesday. Among the companies expected to attend the March 20 meeting: Amazon, Snap, Facebook, Google and Twitter. The meeting was confirmed by Amazon and representatives of two companies speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the plans publicly. Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Trump, said in a statement that Mrs. Trump ""has simply asked for a meeting to discuss one of the many things that impacts children — as she has done many times in the past, on several different topics."" The meeting, first reported by The Washington Post, would mark Mrs. Trump's first public event on a subject she has previously expressed interest in. During the first year of her husband's administration, she played a low-key role. Advertisement Her interest in children has been clear, with visits to schools and hospitals. In her first public remarks at the United Nations last year, Mrs. Trump called on world leaders to come together for the good of their children, saying: ""We must remember that they are watching and listening, so we must never miss an opportunity to teach life's many ethical lessons along the way.""  . During the presidential campaign, Melania Trump mentioned doing work to address bullying — a notable choice given the president-elect's penchant for name-calling on social media.

 (Reuters) - U.S. media company Meredith Corp has hired advisers to explore a sale of its Time, Fortune, Money and Sports Illustrated magazines following its $1.84 billion acquisition of Time Inc in January, people familiar with the matter said. The move illustrates how Meredith sees some of Time Inc's titles that attract primarily male readership as not playing to its core strength in women's magazines, which include Better Homes & Gardens, Family Circle and Martha Stewart Living. The Des Moines, Iowa-based company has tapped investment banks Citigroup Inc and Houlihan Lokey Inc to find potential buyers for the magazines, the sources said this week. There is no certainty that a divestiture will occur, the sources added. While it's possible that media, telecommunications or technology companies could express an interest in the magazines, a sale to wealthy individuals, such as philanthropists or billionaires, is viewed by Meredith as more likely, according to one of the sources. Advertisement The sources asked not to be identified because details of the sale process are confidential. Citigroup declined to comment, while Houlihan Lokey did not immediately return a request for comment. Advertisement ""We are in fact exploring a number of additional changes to the (magazine) portfolio, including divestitures of brands and businesses that might perform better under a different owner,"" Meredith CEO Steven Lacy told investors at a Deutsche Bank conference earlier this month. Time Inc referred calls to Meredith, which declined to comment beyond reiterating that the company is reviewing its portfolio.  . It was not clear how much the magazines could be worth. Fortune and Money generated more than $20 million in 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBIDTA), while Time generated more than $30 million in 12-month EBITDA, according to one of the people. The potential divestitures underscore how Time Inc's primary attraction for Meredith was building scale in digital advertising. With its roots in traditional publishing, Meredith has been in a fierce competitive online race against internet giants such as Alphabet Inc’s Google and Facebook Inc for consumer eyeballs and advertising dollars. The deal with Time Inc expanded Meredith's reach with internet-savvy millennials, creating a digital media business with 170 million monthly unique visitors in the United States and more than 10 billion annual video views. Meredith's acquisition of Time Inc was aided by a $650 million investment from the private equity arm of Charles and David  Koch, the billionaire brothers known for championing conservative political causes.

 LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO —  Streaming music leader Spotify used its cultural cool factor to appeal to mom-and-pop investors in an unconventional presentation ahead of its April 3 stock market listing. Led by 35-year-old Chief Executive Daniel Ek, wearing jeans, white t-shirt and a dark blazer, executives said Spotify would prioritize growth over profits to fend off big rivals Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc, while also seeing a clear path to making money. Ek's team made a direct case to individual investors in a public webcast instead of a traditional closed-door road show typically used to woo institutional investors in initial public offerings (IPOs). The Stockholm-based company's stock will hit the public markets in a direct listing without traditional underwriters. It must convince investors that its business is sound and that investors who buy shares in the public market debut will not be hurt by unexpected volatility. Advertisement ""You won't see us ringing any bells or throwing any parties,"" Ek said. ""Since Spotify isn't selling any stock in the listing, we're really entirely focused on the long-term performance of the business."" Advertisement The direct listing is critical to alleviating Spotify's losses, which are driven by financing costs, and will enable all late-stage investors to convert debt holdings into equity. Spotify's revenue grew 39 percent to 4.09 billion euros ($5.04 billion) in 2017 from 2.95 billion euros in 2016, it said in a securities filing. At the same time, net financing costs of 855 million euros pushed up operating losses to 378 million euros from 349 million euros. Chief Financial Officer Barry McCarthy, the former long-serving CFO of streaming video giant Netflix Inc, said Spotify's strategy was to prioritize growth before short-term profitability, and that greater scale would enable profit margins to swell. With 71 million subscribers at the end of 2017, Spotify is the leader in streaming music. It also has 92 million users of its free, advertising-supported service, which it says delivers a constant stream of converts to its paid offering. That will keep it ahead of Apple, the company believes. Tomas Otterbeck, an equities analyst with Swedish research firm Redeye, said he was impressed by McCarthy repeating the idea that ""We are playing a market share game"" and that Spotify could reach 100 million paying subscribers by early next year. The independent service is jockeying against efforts from Apple, which has 38 million paid listeners and eschews  advertising-supported services.  . Apple, Spotify, Google and other services charge around $9.99 a month for music subscriptions. Amazon Prime service subscribers can get the music service for $7.99 a month. Ek portrayed Spotify as an underdog not tied to a major technology company, describing a strategy to be a ubiquitous music service available across phones, computers, smart speakers and car entertainment systems. Advertisement Because the company will not issue any new shares, it did not specify a listing price. Based on private transactions, it is valued at roughly $19 billion, according to Reuters calculations. It has hired brokerage Morgan Stanley to match buy and sell orders to set its opening trading price and said it will provide financial guidance to investors on March 26. STAYING AHEAD McCarthy spelled out Spotify’s long-term operating targets for generating sustained free cash flow, with annual revenue growth between 25 and 35 percent and gross margin between 30 and35 percent - ambitious for a loss-making company. Helping listeners find new bands and songs is an ""infinitely larger"" opportunity in music than so-called discovery was for video, McCarthy said, comparing Netflix’s rapid rise from mail-order DVD distribution into a streaming media service to Spotify’s audio streaming business. Spotify could devour the $28 billion, advertising-driven radio market, he said. Advertising makes up only about 10 percent of Spotify's current revenue, and McCarthy said he would be ""thrilled"" if Spotify could pull in 20 percent of its revenue from ads, although he expressed some doubt about whether the company could hit that mark. “There is an enormous pay-off for whoever wins. Now it remains to be seen whether we will win, but that's the game we are playing,"" he said.

 SEATTLE —  Microsoft Corp on Monday said 200,000 organizations are now using Teams, its year-old workplace collaboration software, up from 125,000 in September, a sign the company may be making some progress in its battle with Slack Technologies Inc. Microsoft also announced a slate of new features for Teams, including instant language translation. Slack's emergence as a popular platform for workplace messaging and document-sharing is a threat to Microsoft's long-standing dominance in office productivity software. Teams now comes bundled with Microsoft Office 365 as the company battles rival offerings from companies including privately-held Slack, Alphabet Inc's Google, Atlassian Corp PLC, Cisco Systems Inc and Facebook Inc. ""These group messaging tools go far beyond just chat and are becoming a central hub for integrating a variety of business applications into a single user interface,"" said Alan Lepofsky, analyst with Constellation Research. ""They are essentially the new inbox."" Advertisement Microsoft has raced to make Teams a viable competitor after realizing several years ago that Slack was making inroads with big customers. A former Microsoft Office executive told Reuters that learning of the widespread adoption of Slack at Walt Disney Co in early 2015 was an especially important wake-up call. Advertisement ""It's one thing when an app gains traction with startups in Silicon Valley, that happens all the time,"" said the former employee, who asked not to be named. ""But it's another when your biggest, longest-tenured customers start adopting it, and then you realize you have to respond."" San Francisco-based Slack said in September that it had 6 million daily users and more than 50,000 paying teams. It has not published new figures since then. Microsoft has not released comparable figures for Teams. Slack has a big lead when it comes to third-party applications, with more than 1,000 compared to 250 for Teams.  . Teams is still not as simple to use as Slack and lacks the depth of functionality, said Wayne Kurtzman, an analyst with the research firm IDC. ""As great as Microsoft Teams has done in the past year, it's still not as mature of a product,"" Kurtzman said. Microsoft says it is gaining ground, pointing to customers such as Navistar, the manufacturer of trucks and buses. Navistar moved about a thousand employees onto Teams last year, choosing it over Slack due to its long-time relationship with Microsoft, said Terry Kline, Navistar chief information officer. ""We looked at Slack, and we didn't see any significant advantage,"" Kline told Reuters in a phone interview. The move has reduced the company's use of email by 3 percent, he added. Other Teams customers include Macy's, General Motors, General Electric, ConocoPhillips and Nascar, according to Microsoft. ""It's surprised all of us how extremely well it's doing,"" Microsoft Teams General Manager Lori Wright told Reuters.

DEALBOOK
MARCH 12, 2018
 The company Kitty Hawk has been testing a new kind of fully electric, self-piloting flying taxi. It takes off like a helicopter and flies like a plane. Since October, a mysterious flying object has been seen moving through the skies over the South Island of New Zealand. It looks like a cross between a small plane and a drone, with a series of small rotor blades along each wing that allow it to take off like a helicopter and then fly like a plane. To those on the ground, it has always been unclear whether there was a pilot aboard. Well, it turns out that the airborne vehicle has been part of a series of “stealth” test flights by a company personally financed by Larry Page, the co-founder of Google and now the chief executive of Google’s parent, Alphabet. The company, known as Kitty Hawk and run by Sebastian Thrun, who helped start Google’s autonomous car unit as the director of Google X, has been testing a new kind of fully electric, self-piloting flying taxi. This is an altogether different project from the one you might have seen last year in a viral video of a single-pilot recreational aircraft that was being tested over water, and it’s much more ambitious. Imagine starting a network of autonomous air taxis, as Uber is planning to, but long before Uber actually does. That’s what Mr. Page is trying to do. Advertisement Until now, you wouldn’t know the air taxis in New Zealand had anything to do with Mr. Page: The planes operate there in what has been a covert project, under a company called Zephyr Airworks. Advertisement Now that project is about to go public: On Tuesday, Mr. Page’s company and the prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, will announce they have reached an agreement to test Kitty Hawk’s autonomous planes as part of an official certification process. The hope is that it will lead to a commercial network of flying taxis in New Zealand in as soon as three years. The move is a big step forward in the commercialization of this technology, which even the most optimistic prognosticators had recently bet would take another decade to achieve. The decision to embrace the commercial use of flying taxis offers New Zealand an opportunity to leapfrog many developed countries in this area, and perhaps give it a head start over Silicon Valley, where much of the most innovative work has been taking place. In an email, Ms. Ardern said the decision to work with Kitty Hawk was “about sending the message to the world that our doors are open for people with great ideas who want to turn them into reality.” She added, “We’ve got an ambitious target in New Zealand of being net carbon zero by 2050,” and given that the Kitty Hawk vehicle is fully electric, “exciting projects like this are part of how we make that happen.” Back here in the United States, the move stands as a major challenge for our regulators, in particular the Federal Aviation Administration. While the F.A.A. allows test flights of autonomous vehicles, there is no path to certify and commercialize them despite a constant stream of headlines about efforts from Uber, Airbus and others. Thus far, the agency, which oversees much busier skies than New Zealand and has long been underfunded, has been slow to adopt rules for new technologies. Other countries, mostly in the Middle East and Africa, have been more aggressive about allowing unmanned flights and appear willing to be some of the first places where this technology will be used. But those countries have never been seen as models for aviation regulators in the rest of the developed world. New Zealand, on the other hand, has long been viewed as having a thoughtful and safety-conscious regulatory regime. That means that the rules it develops may become a template for other nations, including the United States. A number of rival companies have been laying the groundwork for air taxis. In November, Boeing acquired Aurora Flight Sciences. Airbus made an investment two weeks ago in Blade, an aviation start-up in New York. Dubai formed a partnership with a Chinese company, EHang. And of course Uber has an entire division called Uber Elevate. Advertisement For those who follow the progress in this field — technologists, flight enthusiasts and billionaires seeking to transform the skies — it was thought that Mr. Page had been testing flights of a new self-piloting plane only in Northern California; several reports and images revealed the existence of newfangled aircraft last year from a company based there, called Zee Aero, that was associated with Mr. Page. The mystery of what has been going on in New Zealand has quietly created a stir among those in the know. Kitty Hawk set up Zephyr in 2016 and has been in discussions, under a nondisclosure agreement, with regulators there for the past 18 months. There has been some speculation about the origin of Zephyr because it lists its chief executive as Fred Reid, who had also been listed as president of Zee Aero.  . Mr. Page’s ambitions to create taxis in the sky has a sense of gravity, excuse the pun, not just because of his deep pockets and the technological prowess of his team but also because of Mr. Reid, who is a former chief executive of Virgin America. Before that he was president of Delta Air Lines and president of Lufthansa Airlines, where he was co-architect of the Star Alliance. In an interview, Mr. Reid said the opportunity to use New Zealand as the first place to commercialize the autonomous taxi service was a step-change in the advancement of the sector. Kitty Hawk is already working on an app that would allow customers to hail one of its air taxis. The aircraft, known as Cora, has a wingspan of 36 feet with a dozen rotors all powered by batteries. It can fly about 62 miles and carry two passengers. (Its code name had been Zee.Aero — hence all the speculation and confusion.) The plan, at least for now, isn’t for Kitty Hawk to sell the vehicles; it wants to own and operate a network of them itself. But before everyone gets too excited — or nervous — about this “Jetsons”-like future, just know that virtually every prediction about how quickly air taxis would arrive has been wrong. Just last year, Dubai said EHang would begin operating an autonomous flying taxi service last July. It never happened. An earlier version of this article misstated the wingspan of the Cora aircraft being tested in New Zealand. It is 36 feet, not 12 feet.

T1,12-Mar-18,"Advertisement By REUTERSMARCH 12, 2018, 6:24 P.M. E.D.T.
 (Reuters) - Dropbox Inc on Monday offered a price range for shares in its initial public offering that would value it at up to $7.1 billion, nearly a third below the valuation it commanded in 2014, a clear sign of how overheated the private tech market became a few years back. Cloud storage company Dropbox is the largest tech IPO after a protracted dry spell, and investors are carefully watching it for signs of how other highly valued tech companies will be received by the public markets. If Dropbox is a barometer for public market sentiment, it appears that investors will not endorse the valuations that many billion-dollar-plus startups now command. The spring calendar for technology offerings is relatively busy, including cyber security company Zscaler's planned debut later this week and music company Spotify's expected listing early next month. San Francisco-based Dropbox set a price range of $16 to $18 per share, which would raise up to $648 million in the highly anticipated public offering planned for Friday. The range serves as guidance, and the company will set a final price, based on investor feedback, on the eve of the IPO. Advertisement The pricing is about a 30 percent drop from the $10 billion valuation Dropbox earned in early 2014 after a financing round led by BlackRock Inc. The company, which started as a free service to share and store photos, music and other large files, has raised more than $600 million from private investors. Advertisement New investors ranging from mutual funds to hedge funds began piling into startups a few years ago in hopes of earning better returns than the public markets offered, driving a spike in investments beginning in 2014 that came with outsized valuations. Now, Dropbox's valuation cut suggests other companies that similarly raised a lot of money at high valuations but remain unprofitable, such as Uber Technologies Inc, may face a valuation decrease when they, too, go public. ""Dropbox is still loss-making and its revenue is not enough to justify a market value of $10 billion,"" said Phil Davis, chief executive of Phil's Stock World, an investment advisory service. ""The price had to come down to lure in the investors."" While venture financing remains high, startup valuations have mostly stabilized in the United States. ""GROSSLY OVERVALUED UNICORNS"" Dropbox competes with much larger companies such as Alphabet Inc's Google, Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com Inc as well as main rival Box Inc. It long struggled to monetize a product that many of its larger rivals offer for free and moved to offer more products for businesses, such as file synch and group collaboration tools.  . The efforts appear to have paid off. Revenues grew by 31 percent to $1.1 billion in 2017 over the prior year, and losses narrowed by almost half to $112 million. Last year, it had positive free cash flow of $305 million, more than double the previous year. By comparison, revenue at Box, which started two years before Dropbox, is expected to increase 25 percent to about $506 million this fiscal year from a year earlier. Box, which also is not profitable, went public in 2015. Dropbox's $7.07 billion valuation, based on the high end of its IPO price range, is two-and-a-half times that of Box's $2.85 billion market capitalization. Advertisement Despite its progress and four years of growth, Dropbox's financial performance still does not justify its 2014 valuation, some investors say. Eric Schiffer, chairman and chief executive of the Patriarch Organization, a private equity firm, said Wall Street had rational figures for ""grossly overvalued unicorns,"" using the term for startup companies valued at $1 billion or more. ""The IPO is a slap in the face to investors of the 2014 round"" of Dropbox, he added.    Dropbox, co-founded in 2007 by Andrew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, has 500 million users across 180 countries. But most use the free service - about 11 million are paying customers. Upon completion of the public offering, Dropbox will sell $100 million worth of common stock at the IPO price to the venture capital arm of Salesforce.com Inc in a separate private placement, the company said. Houston is the largest shareholder and will retain 24 percent of Dropbox after selling 2.3 million shares in the offering. Sequoia Capital is the largest shareholder among outside investors, with about a 25 percent stake.

T1,12-Mar-18,"Advertisement Supported by By Sapna Maheshwari In a sunny office in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, Mike Schmidt spends his time ferreting out fake Instagram accounts. Some are obvious, like the one that had never posted a photo and lacked a profile picture yet followed about 7,500 accounts — the maximum allowed by the social media site. Others are trickier. Mr. Schmidt had to scroll down a little on an account with the name @ailebnoblk before the same stock image of a car showed up three times in a row, a clue that there was no real person behind the profile. “The amount of bot activity that’s happening on these platforms is pretty insane,” Mr. Schmidt said. “Just the amount of new accounts and times these folks are liking and commenting with spam and positive comments and happy-face emojis.” Dovetale, a four-person software company Mr. Schmidt co-founded in 2016, has devised a range of tactics to identify large numbers of fake accounts that follow popular Instagram personalities. It then packages that information for marketers, who are increasingly skeptical of the audience numbers that often determine how much money social media stars can command from advertisers. Marketers are flocking to businesses like Dovetale, prompted by revelations like those in a recent investigation by The New York Times that detailed the booming industry of people buying fake followers and fraudulent engagement on Twitter and other social media sites. Some of these fake accounts, in an attempt to seem legitimate, use personal information from real people without their knowledge. That has provoked concern among brands and their agencies, which often rely on metrics like the number of followers an account has when hiring people on YouTube and Instagram to promote their products. These social media stars can often fetch thousands of dollars for one post promoting a product. “We knew this kind of day of reckoning would come,” said Erick Schwab, the co-founder of Sylo, which vets influencers for fraud and aims to assign a numerical score to their content akin to a Nielsen rating. “We’ve gotten tons of brands, agencies, vendors emailing us, who we’ve been having conversations with for a while, but now they’re sort of like, this is being demanded.” Krishna Subramanian, a founder of Captiv8, which connects brands with influencers, has seen a surge in requests for fraud detection from agencies. “Everyone is definitely scrambling because they don’t want to be held responsible,” he said. The interest in such firms reflects how easy it is to fake popularity on platforms like Instagram, where bots seem to run unchecked even on accounts where people have not paid for them. While many advertisers have become aware of this, and tried to place more emphasis on content quality or favorable comments, follower numbers still tend to loom large. “Even though brands are looking for engagement more, the actual pay and compensation that influencers are getting is still based on the follower number,” said Alivia Latimer, a photographer with about 102,000 Instagram followers. Ms. Latimer, who has worked with brands including Lush Cosmetics and Hollister, said that she charged about $1,200 for a branded post. She added that she knew people with two million followers who charge $40,000 per post. That means new kinds of detective work are needed for brands that still want the endorsements of the young and hip online. Dovetale said it uses more than 50 metrics to analyze the Instagram followers of popular accounts, including the language in the bios, the rate at which they hit “like” and “follow,” and their country of origin. (An influencer with a high number of followers from Turkey, Brazil and China, for instance, can raise red flags for Dovetale, which has frequently seen fake followers come from those countries.) The clues can be complex. Dovetale flagged one account that claimed to be someone named Meg Cragle because it was part of a group of profiles that had made one or two unrelated posts and contained similarly worded bios of exactly 99 characters that ended with ellipses. The discovery was reinforced by a Google search for phrases in the account’s bio like “award-winning bacon fanatic,” which matched the terms in a now-deleted Twitter bio generator online. Dovetale acknowledged that its methods were not foolproof, but they are valuable enough in a murky landscape that the agency 360i said it was now unlikely to hire influencers for campaigns if Dovetale’s database said more than 2 to 3 percent of their followers were bots. Dovetale said that, on average, 16.4 percent of the followers on Instagram’s top 20 accounts were fraudulent. Sylo, which requires influencers to share access to their public and private post statistics, said it had rejected 77 percent of influencers who have tried to register on its platform after their accounts showed issues like abnormal spikes in engagement on posts or a large number of generic, emoji-laden comments that bots are known for. “In the absence of direct pressure on the platforms, it’s a way for advertisers to take more control of their own spend and not be at the mercy of the platforms themselves,” said Jeff Semones, head of social media at MediaCom, which has recommended Sylo to clients. While he said Instagram had removed many accounts that were flagrantly violating its terms and conditions, “a lot of one-off activity goes unchecked.” A spokeswoman for Instagram said that the platform’s “internal estimates show that spam accounts make up a small fraction” of Instagram’s 800 million monthly users. Some believe that the new awareness around bots highlights the misguided expectations that marketers have for how many people they can reach through influencers. Changes to algorithms on Facebook and Instagram have significantly reduced the number of people who will see a person’s posts without paid promotion. And unless advertisers are paying Instagram for the information, they typically have to rely on screenshots from influencers for data on how many people saw a post. Influencers like Ms. Latimer said that even then, not all brands request those screenshots. Tyler Stark, director of marketing at Traeger Grills, said that many influencers, particularly on Facebook, reach only 2 percent of their audience. That has made smaller influencers more appealing and put a focus on engagement, he said, with the thought that a post with a large number of likes and comments will end up in the feeds of more people. Still, Bob Gilbreath, chief executive of Ahalogy, a marketing technology company in Cincinnati, said that he recently heard a major retailer recommend that brands work only with influencers who have at least 200,000 followers. “Most brands would say that a follower is someone who’s definitely going to see the post,” Mr. Gilbreath said. “Not only are most people not seeing the posts even if they’re real people, but many of them are not real people.” Soapbox Influencer Marketing, a company that connects brands with influencers, features a case study on its website for a new hummus from Bush’s Beans. The site claims that the campaign, which featured 519 influencer posts, resulted in a whopping 891 million impressions — nearly triple the American population. When asked about the figure, Beth Stephens, the company’s president, said it was “incorrectly listed on our website and needs to be corrected.” She added that Bush’s Beans also worked with “a number of other influence and social service providers,” making it difficult for Soapbox to directly assess the figure. Bush’s Beans didn’t return requests for comment. Others tout the “total reach” of fashion and food influencers on their websites. In other types of media and Instagram’s own business analytics, “reach” refers to the number of different people who actually saw an ad. But in influencer marketing, it often refers to an aggregation of followers across platforms and can even include monthly unique visitors to blogs. Mr. Gilbreath is still a proponent of the work that comes out of social media mavens, but has instead focused on hiring creative “micro” influencers with 10,000 or more followers. The firm pays to promote their recipes or tips and tracks subsequent visits to their websites, he said, adding that the data is otherwise too unreliable. Corey Martin, head of influencer marketing at 360i, said that the agency was increasingly paying Instagram to promote posts from influencers, which allows the agency to “track and trace consumer behavior in a way we previously hadn’t.” Some hope for more action from Instagram, especially since it plans to restrict access to some of its data later this year, which may impede the work of bot-hunters like Dovetale. “It will be unfair until Instagram really just cleans out the bots and the lurkers,” said Caitlin Sakdalan, who runs the account @BeFatBeHappy. “There’s so many different programs that people use and algorithms and we can all say this and all say that, but until Instagram itself kind of does it for the community, I think it will be an unfair playing field.” Email Sapna Maheshwari at sapna@nytimes.com or follow her on Twitter: @sapna.

T2,12-Mar-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin MARCH 12, 2018
 Good Monday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Trump puts an end to Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm. • David Solomon is Goldman Sachs’s heir apparent. • Can Solomon get Goldman playing a new tune? • Apple agrees to buy Texture. • Short Netflix • Dropbox unveils its I.P.O. target. Get this in your inbox every morning. Sign up here. President Trump on Monday blocked Broadcom’s bid for the chip maker Qualcomm, citing national security concerns. In a presidential order, Mr. Trump said “there is credible evidence” that led him to believe Singapore-based Broadcom’s control of Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, “might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.” Advertisement The extraordinary action by the president underscored the more forceful and protectionist action his administration has taken in recent weeks to protect American companies and ward off foreign investment in the United States. It followed an intervention this month by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which typically works behind closed doors and reviews deals only after they are announced, to stall the deal because of national security concerns. Advertisement From President Trump’s order: (a) There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that Broadcom Limited, a limited company organized under the laws of Singapore (Broadcom), along with its partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates, including Broadcom Corporation, a California corporation, and Broadcom Cayman L.P., a Cayman Islands limited partnership, and their partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates (together, the Purchaser), through exercising control of Qualcomm Incorporated (Qualcomm), a Delaware corporation, might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States; and (b) Provisions of law, other than section 721 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), do not, in my judgment, provide adequate and appropriate authority for me to protect the national security in this matter. Further down (e) The Purchaser and Qualcomm shall immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover. Immediately upon completion of all steps necessary to terminate the proposed takeover of Qualcomm, the Purchaser and Qualcomm shall certify in writing to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) that such termination has been effected in accordance with this order and that all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the proposed takeover of Qualcomm have been completed. Most C.E.O.s have to go to work each day and grind out better margins in highly competitive businesses that taxpayers won’t bail out if they blow up. This is now the fate that awaits the next C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs. In apparently priming David M. Solomon for the job, Goldman seems to be signaling that, even if trading revenue revives after some difficult quarters, it intends to press on with its efforts to bolster its nontrading businesses, like lending to corporations and consumers. Mr. Solomon, after a successful run as the head of Goldman’s powerful deal-making business, embodies in many ways the bank’s hopes to be far more than a high-octane trading shop. Of course, if the Trump administration guts Wall Street regulations, particularly the Volcker Rule, Goldman may be tempted to pile back into trading. But the bank’s recent track record in trading suggests that would not be a good idea. Not only does Goldman’s business that trades bonds, derivatives, currencies and commodities bounce around too much for shareholders’ tastes, it is opaque. Bank executives are often loath to talk in detail when it underperforms. Goldman also made strategic mistakes in this business in recent years. It focused too heavily on hedge fund clients, something it is trying to fix by reaching out to different types of customers. Its commodities business, which it clung to in the face of political pressure, has been a drawn out disappointment. And Wall Street traders ought not to get too excited about the prospects of deregulation. As some rules get loosened, others may get toughened up, like those that would liquidate a troubled Wall Street firm rather than bail it out. While the government may not be winding down any large banks anytime soon, the diminished likelihood of bailouts can force up the cost of borrowing for firms like Goldman. This, in turn, may steer them away from riskier businesses like trading. Investors still seem to doubt Goldman’s desire to adapt to a much more ordinary future. This is revealed in a comparison of Goldman and its rival, Morgan Stanley. Advertisement Goldman’s return on shareholder equity, a closely watched metric that quantifies the profits generated on shareholders’ money, has been higher than that of Morgan Stanley in recent years. But investors seem just as enthusiastic about the future of Morgan Stanley. Its stock trades at the same multiple to shareholders equity as Goldman’s. Why? Morgan Stanley has arguably done more than Goldman to diversify away from trading to businesses, like wealth management, that are more stable. — Peter Eavis David M. Solomon is Goldman Sachs’s heir apparent. The Wall Street firm said Mr. Solomon would serve as its sole president and chief operating officer, setting him up as the potential successor to Lloyd C. Blankfein, the investment bank’s longtime chief executive. Context Mr. Solomon and Harvey M. Schwartz were seen as the favorites to eventually replace Mr. Blankfein when they were named co-chief operating officers and presidents in December 2016. But, Mr. Schwartz, who previously served as the bank’s chief financial officer and global co-head of the securities division, has decided to retire in April, Goldman said on Monday. “Harvey has been a mentor to many, and his influence has made an indelible impact on generations of professionals at Goldman Sachs,” Mr. Blankfein said in a news release. “I want to thank Harvey for all he’s done for the firm.” Mr. Solomon joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 and previously served as co-head of its investment banking division. — Chad Bray Critic’s corner Anthony Currie of Breakingviews writes: “If Solomon does take the reins, it would end some 12 years of traders holding top positions at the Wall Street firm – and serve as another sign of Goldman’s troubles in that business.” Case in point: • Trading accounted for 53 percent of Goldman’s revenue in 2012. • It made just over a third of the firm’s revenue last year. Advertisement “Meanwhile, takings from merger advisory and stock-and-bond underwriting – Solomon’s world – increased by half over the past six years. So positioning him as likely heir would look like a way of rewarding past success.” Goldman’s reputation for advising companies in mergers and acquisitions is well earned. Most years, it tops the rankings of advisers by deal volume known as the league tables. So it was a bit surprising to see Goldman currently ranked fifth on both the global and the United States league tables. Here’s a look: Global  Morgan Stanley: $228.88 billion JPMorgan: $198.82 billion Bank of America Merrill Lynch: $138.76 billion Lazard: $134.39 billion Goldman Sachs: $131.56 billion United States Morgan Stanley: $132.36 billion Lazard: $119.69 billion JPMorgan: $114.37 billion Centerview: $112.75 billion Goldman Sachs: $102.54 billion Two points to note: 1) It is still early in the year and one big deal can reshuffle the rankings; 2) The value of transactions Goldman has advised on this year is up 31 percent from the same period a year ago. Larry Kudlow emerged Monday as the latest favorite in a changing rotation of potential replacements for Gary D. Cohn as the head the National Economic Council. The job has not been formally offered to Mr. Kudlow, but the CNBC television commentator, who has informally advised President Trump on economic issues, is likely to interview him in the coming days. Context From the NYT’s Maggie Haberman and Jim Tankersley:  Heading into the weekend, the top contender to replace Mr. Cohn was Christopher Liddell, who is a special assistant to the president working with the Office of American Innovation on a team led by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser. Mr. Liddell’s previous experience as a chief financial officer for Microsoft had been seen as a selling point. But after The New York Times reported that Mr. Liddell was under consideration, Mr. Trump received pushback from people both inside and outside the White House, according to the people close to the president. On Monday, The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board wrote a piece critical of Mr. Liddell’s views on free trade. On Sunday, Mr. Trump again began discussing Mr. Kudlow as an option, the people close to the president said. In a revised prospectus filed this morning, the online storage company said that it planned to sell 36 million shares at $16 to $18 a share. At the midpoint of that range, Dropbox would be valued at about $7.5 billion, compared to the $10 billion of its most recent private fund-raising. Advertisement The big thought: The Dropbox offering — along with that of Spotify — could show how interested Wall Street investors are in the latest batch of Silicon Valley “unicorns,” or privately held companies worth at least $1 billion. The man who made Dropbox: Meet Drew Houston, who created a multibillion-dollar business because he forgot to bring a USB flash drive one day while a student at M.I.T. His holdings could be worth nearly $1.7 billion The market for initial public offerings is on a tear, and, going by Dropbox’s latest financial filing, it may be getting a little overheated. Dropbox, a company that stores files on remote computers for consumers and businesses, on Monday said it aims to price its shares at between $16 and $18. The midpoint of those two prices would value Dropbox at around $6.8 billion, excluding some shares that may be awarded to executives in the future. That’s a lot, though about 30 percent below the $10 billion valuation it received after its fundraising round in 2014. At $6.8 billion, Dropbox would be trading at just over six times the $1.1 billion in sales it had for 2017. Companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index trade at 2.3 times sales. Dropbox would also have a higher valuation than Box, another file storage company, whose market value is 5.6 times the revenue it generated in its last fiscal year, which ended in January. Investors may, however, decide that Dropbox’s higher valuation is not justified. True, its sales grew at an impressive 31 percent last year, but that is not materially faster than the 27 percent Box achieved in its latest fiscal year. (Revenue grew 6.3 percent at companies in the S.&P. 500, according to FactSet.) Advertisement Neither company made a profit in their most recent fiscal year. Both are generating positive cash flows, though. And at $330 million last year, Dropbox’s cash flows were more than five times those of Box’s $62 million. If Dropbox went public at the $6.8 billion implied in Monday’s filing, it would trade at 21 times its 2017 cash flows. That is pricey, but that is less than half of Box’s cash flow multiple. — Peter Eavis Speculation has long swirled that Apple should buy Netflix. On Monday, the iPhone maker agreed to buy Texture, the “Netflix of magazines.” Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . The digital magazine app offers users a $10 a month subscription to read more than 200 magazines, including People, the New Yorker, Vanity Fair, and Vogue. The deal is part of Apple’s effort to bolster its services businesses. The WSJ reports: Apple has set a goal of increasing total revenue from services to more than $40 billion by 2020. The company generated nearly $30 billion in services revenue in its fiscal year ended in September. The Texture transaction follows Apple’s deal for Shazam, the music recognition app, in December. Texture is owned by Next Issue Media, a joint-venture between Condé Nast, Hearst, Meredith, News Corp, Rogers Media and K.K.R. Apple did not disclose the price. Shares of the video streaming company are down 3.4 percent Monday to about $320 after the short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research tweeted that he thinks the stock can be ”shorted back to $300.”
