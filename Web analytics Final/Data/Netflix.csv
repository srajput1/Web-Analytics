 News flash: Movie studios have come to rely overwhelmingly on “sequels, reboots, spinoffs, adaptations, and animated movies” and “now exist primarily for the purpose of building and supporting branded franchises.” By contrast, the number of original scripted television series commissioned continues to break records, reaching almost 500 in 2017. The challenge for The Wall Street Journal’s entertainment reporter Ben Fritz’s new book, “The Big Picture: The Fight for the Future of Movies,” is to build a compelling business narrative from phenomena that are obvious to anyone who has walked by a multiplex and has a subscription to Netflix or Amazon Prime. Despite some distracting lapses, to a surprising degree he succeeds. “The Big Picture” holds the reader’s attention by telling the stories of senior executives whose careers were destroyed or made by the changes in the entertainment industry. Mr. Fritz culled the fruits of the infamous Sony hack to paint a vivid portrait of life inside the studio as it struggled to respond to the structural challenges it faced. Sony’s Columbia Pictures, under the leadership of Amy Pascal and Michael Lynton, relied disproportionately on the mid-budget dramas most endangered by the explosion of blockbuster franchises on the big screen and must-see dramatic series on the small screen. The “Big Picture” makes good use of the stolen emails and internal corporate documents to chart the decline of the studio’s fortunes and the corresponding collapse of the once idyllic business partnership between the creative Ms. Pascal and financially oriented Mr. Lynton. Ms. Pascal, who was fired in 2015, and Mr. Lynton, whose departure in 2017 was announced just weeks before a $1 billion studio write-down, never managed to figure out how to thrive in the franchise era. Indeed, they ultimately ceded significant control over the one franchise — Spiderman — to which the studio had secured rights. Advertisement A number of executives have built wildly successful careers optimizing the creative and financial potential of a single brand. Some of them, like Dan Lin, whose Lin Pictures is responsible for exploring the creative possibilities of Legos, are a new breed of executive who combine creative and financial chops. Others, like the Academy Award-winning screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, who has been charged with turning Hasbro’s toys into a film franchise, are established industry figures who have reinvented themselves to align with the times. The portrait of Hollywood that emerges is one in which the power of stars and directors has been usurped by writers/producers whose expertise is brand exploitation. A single producer will manage a cinematic universe across properties, but directors and actors are swapped in and out as economics and professional idiosyncrasies dictate. When Terrence Howard demanded more money for Iron Man’s first sequel, he was quickly replaced by Don Cheadle. The six Spiderman movies since 2002 have grossed almost $5 billion with three different starring actors and directors.  . Studios, for their part, increasingly focus on a relatively small number of established franchises. The rest of their slate is filled with mid-budget films financed by others from whom the studios extract a fee for marketing and distribution. Although Mr. Fritz seems to suggest that something profound has been lost culturally in these shifts, I was left feeling this new industry configuration is preferable for both shareholders and viewers. Everyone is worse off in a world where the “hot” star or director of the moment can force a studio to fund their latest vanity project. The strength of the narrative and reporting in “The Big Picture” is not matched by equally trenchant judgments and predictions. Mr. Fritz’s observations, both aesthetic and financial, are often unconvincing and unnecessarily hyperbolic — particularly in contrasting the contemporary film and television businesses. Advertisement I have not attempted to watch all of the new original scripted TV series — it would be more than a full-time job — but what I have seen makes me skeptical of Mr. Fritz’s assertion that “most” of them are “interesting, sophisticated and made for intelligent adults.” He repeats the canard that Netflix has magical powers to pick hits. As evidence, he points to Netflix’s awareness of how previous Kevin Spacey and David Fincher films had performed on its platform to justify the $100 million bet on “House of Cards.” Mr. Fritz does not share the talismanic algorithm that led Netflix to spend almost as much on the disastrous “Marco Polo” series. In television, as in film, if you count only the hits, everyone is a genius. Mr. Fritz claims that “a new economics of film” has emerged in which dependable funding will come from “subscriptions to video services, wireless packages, and free product shipping.” He expresses confidence that this model “will flourish” indefinitely producing “as many and perhaps more” movies than ever alongside the apparently limitless flow of new series. History has shown, however, that even the deepest pockets eventually tire of being emptied. As long as there are no structural barriers to creating new entertainment content — or investing to establish the next great branded franchise — the quest for sustainable superior returns will remain elusive. As a result, the future of entertainment — with a rotating cast of hapless investors embracing a shifting set of new and improved strategic imperatives — is likely to look a lot like the past.

 LONDON/FRANKFURT —  German broadcaster ProSiebenSat 1 Media rejected a critical report on Tuesday by short-seller Viceroy Research, saying the allegations of questionable accounting contained in it were ""unfounded and distorting reality"". ProSieben's shares fell as much as 9 percent after the release of the report, which coincided with news the company was dropping out of Germany's DAX Index of blue-chip stocks. Viceroy, which has targeted companies including South African retailer Steinhoff, alleged in its 37-page report that ProSieben had overpaid for acquisitions and was inflating revenues from non-cash transactions. In particular, it took aim at ProSieben's media-for-equity model, in which it offers free advertising airtime on its channels in exchange for stakes in companies the broadcaster is investing in. Advertisement ""ProSieben has subsidized a fabricated digital 'growth story' using cash flows from its TV advertising business and idle TV advertising inventory,"" the report said. Advertisement ""As its core business declines, ProSieben can no longer counterbalance its underperforming digital segments - the earnings structure is on the brink of collapse."" Viceroy put a valuation of 7.51 euros (6.69 pounds) on ProSieben's shares, a 75 percent discount to Monday's closing price. In a statement, the Munich-based broadcaster dismissed Viceroy's allegations out of hand and said it would respond in more detail in due course ""The allegations of short-seller Viceroy contained in their report are unfounded and distorting reality,"" ProSieben said, reiterating its 2017 results and outlook published on Feb. 22. Viceroy's report into Steinhoff was followed by an admission of ""accounting irregularities"" that triggered an 85-percent slide in its share price. The South African government has, however, called for an investigation into Viceroy after a separate report on Capitec sparked a sell-off in the bank's stock.  . SHORT-SELLER TARGET ProSieben has for months been in the sights of short sellers - speculators who position themselves to profit from share-price falls - as the company was forced to issue a series of outlook downgrades due to weak TV ad revenues. Despite former CEO Thomas Ebeling's drive to diversify into business lines such as e-commerce, weak ad revenues eventually proved to be his undoing and he stepped down as CEO last month after nine years in charge. Advertisement He was replaced by Max Conze, former CEO at British vacuum cleaner maker Dyson. In December, Swedish hedge fund Bodenholm Capital disclosed a short position in ProSieben, saying the company was losing market share, as well as criticising the number of one-off costs the business reported. Other funds that have shorted Prosieben's shares include AQR Capital Management and Old Mutual Global Investors, according to German regulatory filings. Viceroy founder Fraser Perring told Reuters he had a fundamentally bearish take on the media sector, as young viewers flee and digital platforms attract advertisers. His attitude towards ProSieben's media-for-equity model was that ""it smacks of desperation"". ""They are recognising value of equity significantly higher than what it is worth. If they were a private equity firm, what is their strategy, what are their synergies?"" he told Reuters. More broadly, broadcast media faces an onslaught from platform giants like Amazon and Netflix with their video-on-demand offering of original TV content and Hollywood hits attracting millions of viewers. Netflix, whose shares have risen 64 percent so far this year, has added more than the equivalent of ProSieben's entire equity market value in the last two trading days alone. ProSieben's shares were down 5.2 percent at 28.47 euros as of 1330 GMT, valuing the company at about $8 billion.

ECONOMIC SCENE
MARCH 6, 2018
 Should Facebook pay us for our puppy pictures? Of course, the idea sounds crazy. Posting puppies on Facebook is not a chore. We love it: Facebook’s 1.4 billion daily users spend the better part of an hour on it every day. It’s amazing that we don’t have to pay for it. And yet the idea is gaining momentum in Silicon Valley and beyond: Facebook and the other technological Goliaths offering free online services — from which they harvest data from and about their users — should pay for every nugget of information they reap. The spring break pictures on Instagram, the YouTube video explaining Minecraft tactics, the internet searches and the Amazon purchases, even your speed following Waze on the way to spend Thanksgiving with your in-laws — this data is valuable. It will become more valuable, potentially much more so, in the not-too-distant future. Getting companies to pay transparently for the information will not just provide a better deal for the users whose data is scooped up as they go about their online lives. It will also improve the quality of the data on which the information economy is being built. And it could undermine the data titans’ stranglehold on technology’s future, breathing fresh air into an economy losing its vitality. Advertisement The idea has been around for a bit. Jaron Lanier, the tech philosopher and virtual-reality pioneer who now works for Microsoft Research, proposed it in his 2013 book, “Who Owns the Future?,” as a needed corrective to an online economy mostly financed by advertisers’ covert manipulation of users’ consumer choices. It is being picked up in “Radical Markets,” a book due out shortly from Eric A. Posner of the University of Chicago Law School and E. Glen Weyl, principal researcher at Microsoft. And it is playing into European efforts to collect tax revenue from American internet giants. In a report obtained last month by Politico, the European Commission proposes to impose a tax on the revenue of digital companies based on their users’ location, on the grounds that “a significant part of the value of a business is created where the users are based and data is collected and processed.” Users’ data is a valuable commodity. Facebook offers advertisers precisely targeted audiences based on user profiles. YouTube, too, uses users’ preferences to tailor its feed. Still, this pales in comparison with how valuable data is about to become, as the footprint of artificial intelligence extends across the economy. Data is the crucial ingredient of the A.I. revolution. Training systems to perform even relatively straightforward tasks like voice translation, voice transcription or image recognition requires vast amounts of data — like tagged photos, to identify their content, or recordings with transcriptions. Advertisement “Among leading A.I. teams, many can likely replicate others’ software in, at most, one to two years,” notes the technologist Andrew Ng. “But it is exceedingly difficult to get access to someone else’s data. Thus data, rather than software, is the defensible barrier for many businesses.” We may think we get a fair deal, offering our data as the price of sharing puppy pictures. By other metrics, we are being victimized: In the largest technology companies, the share of income going to labor is only about 5 to 15 percent, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl write. That’s way below Walmart’s 80 percent. Consumer data amounts to work they get free. “If these A.I.-driven companies represent the future of broader parts of the economy,” they argue, “without something basic changing in their business model, we may be headed for a world where labor’s share falls dramatically from its current roughly 70 percent to something closer to 20 to 30 percent.”  . As Mr. Lanier, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl point out, it is ironic that humans are providing free data to train the artificial-intelligence systems to replace workers across the economy. Commentators from both left and right fret over how ordinary people will put food on the table once robots take all the jobs. Perhaps a universal basic income, funded by taxes, is the answer? How about paying people for the data they produced to train the robots? If A.I. accounted for 10 percent of the economy and the big-data companies paid two-thirds of their income for data — the same as labor’s share of income across the economy — the share of income going to “workers” would rise drastically. By Mr. Weyl and Mr. Posner’s reckoning, the median household of four would gain $20,000 a year. A critical consideration is that if people were paid for their data, its quality and value would increase. Facebook could directly ask users to tag the puppy pictures to train the machines. It could ask translators to upload their translations. Facebook and Google could demand quality information if the value of the transaction were more transparent. Unwilling to enter in a direct quid pro quo with their users, the data titans must make do with whatever their users submit. The transition would not be painless. We would need to figure out systems to put value on data. Your puppy pictures might turn out to be worthless, but that college translation from Serbo-Croatian could be valuable. Barred from free data, YouTube and Facebook might charge a user fee for their service — like Netflix. Alternatively, they might make their money from training A.I. systems and pay some royalty stream to the many people whose data helped train them. But whatever the cost, the transformation seems worthwhile. Notably, it could help resolve one of the most relevant questions coming into focus in this new technological age: Who will control the data? Today, the dominant data harvesters in the business are Google and Facebook, with Amazon, Apple and Microsoft some way behind. Their dominance cannot really be challenged: Could you think of a rival search engine? Could another social network replace the one all your friends are on? This dominance might matter less if companies had to pay for their users’ data. Advertisement Google and Facebook and Amazon would not be able to extend the network effects that cemented their place at the top of the technology ecosystem to the world of A.I. Everybody wants to be on Facebook because everybody’s friends are on Facebook. But this dominance could be eroded if rivals made direct offers of money for data. Companies with different business models might join the fray. “This is an opportunity for other companies to enter and say look, we will pay you for this data,” Mr. Posner said. “All this is so new that ordinary people haven’t figured out how manipulated they are by these companies.” The big question, of course, is how we get there from here. My guess is that it would be naïve to expect Google and Facebook to start paying for user data of their own accord, even if that improved the quality of the information. Could policymakers step in, somewhat the way the European Commission did, demanding that technology companies compute the value of consumer data? In any event, there is probably a better deal out there, in your future, than giving Facebook free puppy pictures.

T2,9-Mar-18,"Advertisement Supported by By Reuters (Reuters) - Netflix Inc's 65 percent jump so far in 2018 has been so fast that Wall Street analysts earlier this week were as much as $60 behind the curve on a stock most say is a buy. The online video streamer's shares have remained well above analysts' average 12-month target for much of this year, and the gap between the actual share price and the mean target hit a two-year high earlier this week, as the graphics below show. (GRAPHIC: Binge-buying - http://reut.rs/2FpQrI4) (GRAPHIC: Netflix leaps past Wall Street - http://reut.rs/2FncVK5)  Like the other FAANG technology stocks, Netflix shares have soared over the past few years, driven by subscriber growth. While the mean 12-month price target that brokerages have on the shares of Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc, Google-owner Alphabet and Apple Inc are a little above their actual share price, in contrast the mean target for Netflix is well below its current share price. That suggests either that shares in the video streaming pioneer are spectacularly overbought, or Wall Street's biggest names have a lot of work to do.  Three brokerages scrambled to raise their price targets this week, with Pivotal Research raising its target by $100 to $400, while UBS raised its target by $50 to $345. One of the top-rated analysts for the stock, Stifel's Scott Devitt, cut Netflix from ""buy"" to ""hold"" on Thursday while raising his target to $325 from a previous $283. ""We are attracted to Netflix's business and competitive position but believe share price may have sprinted ahead of fundamentals in the short-term,"" Devitt said. Netflix's shares have an intrinsic valuation of $54.95, according to Thomson Reuters data. The stock closed on Thursday at $317, nearly six times that number.

 SAN FRANCISCO —  The Nasdaq blasted through a record high on Friday as traders looking to ride recent momentum piled into Microsoft, Netflix, Amazon.com and other high-performance technology names. The rise came alongside a broad rally in the market. The S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose sharply - up 1.5 percent - as February's jobs report assuaged fears of inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes. The gains came nine years to the day since the bull market began. Microsoft, Apple and Amazon each rose more than 1 percent and hit or closely approached all-time highs, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index surged 1.8 percent to its own record. Those stock moves helped push the Nasdaq Composite Index up 1.4 percent to 7,532 points, which is about a third of a percent higher than its previous all-time high on Jan 26. Advertisement The Nasdaq and the S&P 500, also up about 1.4 percent, were both helped by employment data that tempered fears of faster interest rate increases. Advertisement There was no major news specifically related to the tech sector driving its gains. Netflix jumped 3.6 percent, also hitting a record high and bringing the video streaming service's gain in the past year to 65 percent. ""You look at tech and think, 'What is the catalyst that's going to bring it down?' I don't see one in the short term, and that makes me confident as a trader to go into those stocks that have been the leaders,"" said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC.  . Technology stocks have been widely viewed in recent months as a ""crowded trade,"" a situation where most investors have the same opinion, increasing the potential for a volatile selloff if sentiment changes. For example, Bank of Montreal in January launched an exchange traded fund aiming to triple the return of 10 stocks, including the so-called FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix Inc and Google parent Alphabet. Large cap active fund managers recently trimmed their relative weight in technology stocks to 1.18 times the broader market, down from 1.23 last month, giving up to discretionary stocks its position as the most crowded sector, according to a recent report from Bank of America. The Nasdaq is up 9 percent year to date, compared to a 3 percent increase in S&P 500, which has yet to recover from a February selloff sparked by fears of higher interest rates.

 WASHINGTON —  The U.S. Justice Department and AT&T Inc on Friday presented starkly different futures for online video if the wireless and pay-TV giant is allowed to buy Time Warner Inc, as they laid out their cases for a blockbuster antitrust trial. The judge's decision is crucial to the future of both companies and will likely determine how aggressive Republican-controlled antitrust regulators will be in coming years. U.S. President Donald Trump opposes the deal, and critics want to know if Trump's antipathy for Time Warner's CNN news network influenced regulators. In their final briefs before the trial opens on March 19, the two sides disagreed on whether the $85 billion deal would harm rivals in pay television or online video and sparred over whether consumers would pay more because of the planned merger. The Justice Department filed a lawsuit in November to stop AT&T, which owns DirecTV and other products with 25 million subscribers, from buying movie and TV show maker Time Warner, which owns HBO and CNN, among many other channels. Advertisement It argued the deal would mean higher prices for rival cable and online video distributors and for consumers. Advertisement Investors and company executives had been expecting more leeway in mergers with a Republican administration that vowed to reduce government regulation. The outcome of the case could affect other pending vertical mergers, in which different parts of a supply chain, rather than rivals in the same business, join together. Health insurer Cigna Corp wants to buy pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co and CVS Health Corp wants to acquire health insurer Aetna Inc. ""If the Justice Department loses to AT&T in court this will substantially raise the barriers to the Justice Department bringing another vertical challenge such as with respect to CVS/Aetna or Cigna/Express Scripts,"" said Seth Bloom, a veteran of the Justice Department now in private practice. GOVERNMENT SAYS CONSUMERS WILL PAY MORE; AT&T SAYS NO The Justice Department used economic modeling to show that consumers will pay their pay TV provider more for Turner Broadcasting content, if U.S. District Judge Richard Leon allows the deal.  . ""The acquisition would give AT&T a new tool to slow down the development and growth of disruptive online competitors in the future,"" the department added in its brief. ""AT&T can profess it wants to lead the charge to the future, but its internal documents reveal a less attractive reality."" For its part, AT&T said the merger would result in ""more than $2.5 billion in annual synergies by 2020 and more than $25 billion in total synergies on a net present value basis."" AT&T and Time Warner said prices would not rise because the company would compete with newer media companies like Facebook Inc , Alphabet Inc , Amazon.com Inc  and Netflix Inc. ""Nothing will be withheld from competitors; consumer prices will not go up,"" the companies said, arguing the lawsuit itself was holding back consumer access to better products. On Thursday, 11 former Justice Department officials ranging from Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney, and John Dean, President Richard Nixon's lawyer during the Watergate scandal, urged Judge Leon to reconsider his refusal to allow AT&T to demand communications between the White House and Justice Department about the merger probe.

 NEW YORK —  Wall Street got exactly what it wanted from Friday's jobs report: solid hiring, moderate wage growth and continued low unemployment. Investors sent stocks sharply higher, particularly their recent favorites, technology companies. U.S. employers added 313,000 jobs in February, more than forecast, and wages didn't rise as much as investors had feared. The Labor Department also said January's spike in wages was a bit smaller than it originally thought. It made for a happy ninth anniversary for the current bull market. A month earlier, a jump in wages got investors worried about inflation and set off a stock market swoon, giving the benchmark S&P 500 index its first 10 percent decline in two years. ""I think the fears of wages getting out of control in this point in the cycle ... were squashed,"" said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management. Advertisement Bond yields also moved solidly higher as investors anticipated that the solid jobs survey portends more steady growth in the U.S. economy. Advertisement The Nasdaq composite regained the last of its February losses and closed at an all-time high. Banks also rose as interest rates increased, and industrial and health care and basic materials companies also climbed. Those sectors tend to do better when the economy is growing quickly. The S&P 500 index climbed 47.60 points, or 1.7 percent, to 2,786.57. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 440.53 points, or 1.8 percent, to 25,335.74. The Nasdaq composite jumped 132.86 points, or 1.8 percent, to 7,560.81. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks picked up 25.18 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,597.14. Apple rose $3.04, or 1.7 percent, to $179.98 and Microsoft jumped $2.11, or 2.2 percent, to $96.54. Both finished at record highs. Technology companies have led the market's rally since early 2017, and they have led the recovery from its recent lows as well. The S&P 500 is still 3 percent beneath its latest record high close, which came on Jan. 26. None of the other major S&P sectors have recovered all of their February losses, as technology has. Bond prices dropped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.90 percent from 2.85 percent. Banks advanced, but high-dividend stocks like utilities and phone companies fell. Those stocks are often compared to bonds and they tend to fall when yields move higher, as higher yields make them less appealing to investors seeking income. Stocks initially declined last week after President Donald Trump said he would place tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. They've recovered their losses after he granted exemptions to Canada, Mexico, and potentially to other countries. Nixon said the administration appears to be setting itself up to take a harder line in China. While China isn't a major exporter of steel to the U.S., trade disputes between the two countries aren't uncommon and the government is currently investigating China's treatment of intellectual property held by U.S. companies.  . ""Clearly the target here is China and how that unfolds will be important for markets,"" Nixon said. ""The collateral damage could be relatively wide unless it's done carefully, and so far the process has not been very careful."" Advertisement U.S. and South Korean officials said Trump might meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un by May to negotiate a potential end to Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program. The news helped send South Korea's Kospi up 1.1 percent. Other Asian indexes also rose. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 0.5 percent and. Hong Kong's Hang Seng also rose 1.1 percent. The White House later said the meeting won't happen unless North Korea takes ""concrete steps"" to match promises it has made. Netflix rose $14.44, or 4.6 percent, to $331.44 after the New York Times reported that the streaming service is negotiating with Barack Obama to have the former president and his wife Michelle produce shows. The two sides haven't confirmed that they are in talks. GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said a deal with the Obamas would be ""another major win for Netflix"" as it tries to launch more and more original shows. Toymakers fell following news reports that Toys R Us is getting ready to liquidate its U.S. operations. The chain, which filed for bankruptcy protection, has been unable to find a buyer or restructure its debt. Despite its struggles, it's still a major retailer of toys. Hasbro dropped $1.92, or 2.1 percent, to $91.46 while Mattel sank $1.13, or 7.1 percent, to $14.84. Energy companies climbed as benchmark U.S. crude added $1.92 or 3 percent, to $62.04 a barrel in New York, while Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose $1.88, or 3 percent, to $65.49 a barrel in London. Elsewhere, wholesale gasoline added 4 cents to $1.90 a gallon. Heating oil rose 3 cents to $1.89 a gallon. Natural gas lost 4 cents to $2.73 per 1,000 cubic feet. In Europe, France's CAC 40 rose 0.4 percent while Germany's DAX fell 0.1 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain rose 0.3 percent. Gold rose $2.30 to $1,324 an ounce. Silver added 11 cents to $16.61 an ounce. Copper jumped 6 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $3.14 a pound. The dollar rose to 106.77 yen from 106.24 yen.

 Good Friday. Here’s what we’re watching today: • Is Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, planning on stepping down? • The list of those hoping Broadcom fails in its pursuit of Qualcomm keeps growing. • When will wage growth pick up? • Senator Elizabeth Warren has some questions for Apollo and Citi. • How much is Martin Shkreli’s Wu-Tang album worth? • The Trump tariffs have many exceptions. . Don’t already get this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here. Advertisement The Wall Street Journal reported that Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, will step down “as soon as the end of the year,” citing anonymous sources. Advertisement But some important context is necessary: Neither Mr. Blankfein nor the board has set a timeline for him to step down, people briefed on the matter said. Mr. Blankfein has not discussed the possibility of leaving at the end of the year, these people said, though there is a general view that he likely would retire in the next couple of years. And it is very possible that this story may force Mr. Blankfein to move faster to explicitly lay out a timeline than he had originally planned. Is it possible that Mr. Blankfein would step down at the end of 2018? Sure. It is absolutely a possibility, these people said. But it is hardly a certainty. And it is also a possibility that he could step down as C.E.O. but remain chairman, the people said. Is it possible that he could still be at Goldman for part or all of 2019? Sure, these people said. But that’s not a certainty either. Is it possible he is at Goldman in 2020?  That’s less likely, these people agree. Goldman’s board has held discussions about who should succeed Mr. Blankfein ever since Gary Cohn left the firm at the end of 2016, these people said. The board has designated Harvey Schwartz and David Solomon as likely successors, but has not set a specific date for when they need to decide on who will take the reins, these people said. Both men have privately been making plans to take over, these people said. — Andrew Ross Sorkin Here’s Mr. Blankfein’s response to the WSJ story: 
            It's the @WSJ's announcement...not mine. I feel like Huck Finn listening to his own eulogy.         The order President Trump signed on Thursday imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum provided him with wiggle room to exempt countries down the road. In fact, even before signing the order, he suggested the possibility of later excluding allies like Australia. Well, that seems like more of possibility now. Late Friday President Trump said he is working with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on an agreement so Australia will not be subject to the tariffs. 
            Spoke to PM @TurnbullMalcolm of Australia. He is committed to having a very fair and reciprocal military and trade relationship. Working very quickly on a security agreement so we don’t have to impose steel or aluminum tariffs on our ally, the great nation of Australia!         The Wall Street Journal reports that Intel “is considering a range of acquisition alternatives in reaction to Broadcom’s hostile pursuit for Qualcomm.” Advertisement Those options include a possible bid for Broadcom, the WSJ reports citing anonymous sources. Shares of Broadcom jumped 5 percent after hours. Details from the WSJ • Intel is worried about the competitive threat a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm would pose. • Intel has been weighing its options since late last year and has engaged advisers. • Intel might make a bid if Broadcom looks likely to succeed in its pursuit of Qualcomm. Caveats • Any move from Intel is far from certain and one of WSJ’s sources said it is unlikely. Context Washington isn’t so sure a merger of Broadcom and Qualcomm is a good idea. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government panel that reviews transactions’ national security implications, moved to stall the potential takeover of Qualcomm The panel’s intervention put Broadcom’s bid in jeopardy. In practice, reviews by Cfius often lead to the demise of deals. MARCH 9, 2018
 The February jobs report is in. The number of jobs added was the strongest in two years, but wage growth remained lackluster. Advertisement Here are the numbers: • 313,000 jobs were added last month, the most since October 2015. Economists had anticipated a gain of about 200,000. • With revisions to previous months, the three-month average job growth was 242,000 a month. • The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent, the same as in January. • The average hourly wage grew by 0.1 percent. It grew by 0.3 percent in January. The year-over-year increase fell to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent. • The labor force grew by 806,000, pushing the labor force participation rate back up to the 63 percent mark. MARCH 9, 2018
 Context A leap in job gains in February clears the way for the Federal Reserve to raise the benchmark interest rate when it meets this month. The wage figures were disappointing. The jump in hourly earnings in January — which pushed the year-over-year figure to 2.9 percent, from 2.3 percent just three months earlier — was cited as a cause of a market sell-off. With February’s puny growth of 0.1 percent, the year-over-year increase dropped to 2.6 percent. MARCH 9, 2018
 Investors could not have asked for much more from Friday’s jobs report. The numbers for February show the United States economy was able to add a surprisingly large number of new jobs without creating the sort of surge in wages that can prompt investors to worry about inflation. The 10-year Treasury note, which might have sold off on inflation fears, barely budged when the report came out. Futures markets pointed to higher opens for stock markets. Advertisement The economy created 313,000 jobs in February, the most since October 2015. Wages rose 2.6 percent from a year earlier, below the 2.9 percent rate for January that stoked inflation concerns. In theory, as employers add large numbers of new employees, the competition to hire workers should drive wages much higher. Why is that not happening right now? It seems a large number of people who previously weren’t looking for jobs are now entering the work force. That, in part, explains the 800,000 person increase in the labor force. 
            Monster household survey this month: 800k gain in labor force, participation rate and employment-population ratio both up 0.3 percentage points.         But investors will no doubt find something to fret about. Some may decide that the growth in employment is so strong that it won’t be long before wage pressures build up. The amount of slack in the labor force is unknown, so investors shouldn’t rely on it to dampen wage growth indefinitely, according to this view. — Peter Eavis It’s the unknown that torments investors every time the jobs report comes out. Maybe we can shed some light. As Friday’s jobs report showed, the economy is adding large a numbers of jobs without stoking the sort of surge in wages that makes investors worried about inflation. Investors favor these economic conditions because it reduces the chances that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates more quickly than they expect. But how long might wage growth remain moderate? Much depends on how much slack exists in the jobs market. The headline unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, suggests there is very little. But the unemployment rate does not count the people who aren't in the workforce – and who may now enter it. No one knows for sure how many of these people are really looking for a job at any one time, or might do so in the near future. But if there are a lot of them, companies will not struggle to find workers — and wage growth might remain tame. Conversely, if the number of prospective workers on the sideline is small, wage pressures could soon build up. One way to get an idea of the size of this group of people is to look at the employment rate, which measures people with jobs as a percentage of the population (over 16 years old and excluding prisoners.) At 60.4 percent in February, that rate is still well below the level it was at before the 2008 financial crisis. That would imply that there are still a lot of people who could enter the jobs market. Advertisement But our colleague Ben Casselman, who covers economics, has devised an adjusted employment rate that readers might find interesting. How did you adjust the measurement of the employment rate – and why did you make your tweaks? Let me start with the “why?” The employment rate is great in that it avoids all the issues that bedevil the unemployment rate in terms of deciding who should “count” as unemployed. But the problem is that it’s too broad. It includes a huge group of people who no one would expect to work, namely retirees. And that group is growing rapidly because baby boomers are aging. So if we want the employment rate to tell us anything meaningful about the state of the economy, we have to account for that big demographic trend in some way. One easy way to do this is to look at the employment rate among so-called “prime-age” workers, those ages 25 to 54. That excludes both retirees and most college students, which means it filters out a lot of the demographic noise in the employment rate. The problem is, it filters out a lot of valuable information, too. Lots of 55-year-olds work! And indeed, 55-year-olds are much more likely to work now than they were a generation ago. My calculation, which borrows from an approach used by economists (and occasional Upshot contributor) Ernie Tedeschi, adjusts for demographic shifts by controlling for age and sex. It essentially asks, “What would the employment rate look like today if the U.S. population still had the same demographic profile as it did before the recession?” What does your adjusted employment rate tell us about the jobs market right now? By my calculation, the demographics-adjusted employment rate was at 62.8 percent in February, which is almost exactly where it stood in December 2007, which was the first month of the recession. But it’s still significantly below where we were in 2000, the last time the unemployment rate got this low. Can we use your adjusted employment rate to get an idea of how much slack is left in the labor force? Yes, but it doesn’t give a definitive answer. What it tells us is that the employment rate has fully recovered from the recession. It doesn’t necessarily mean that all the slack is gone. Let me expand on that slightly. Between the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the peak of the housing bubble in 2007, the age-adjusted employment rate fell by about a percentage point. There are two reads on that. One is that the job market just never got as good in the mid-2000s as it did in 1999 and 2000. The other interpretation is that there has been a fundamental shift in the economy, and for some set of reasons — technology, globalization, video games — the share of Americans who are willing or able to work has fallen. Advertisement If you buy that second story, then the fact that the age-adjusted employment rate is back to prerecession levels should tell you that we’re basically at full-employment today. The slack is gone. This is as good as it gets. But I would argue the last couple years should lead to significant skepticism about this kind of structural-change thesis. The labor force has grown dramatically over the last few years. Job growth has continued unabated. Unemployment rates for marginalized groups such as black Americans have fallen sharply. And this has all happened in an environment where wage growth has been sluggish, which suggests that employers are able to attract workers without boosting pay, at least by much. All of that suggests that there are still people out there who are willing to work if opportunities become available. I don’t know if we can get back to that 2000 employment level, but today’s report suggests we can at least keep moving in that direction. • Joseph Song and Michelle Meyer, BofA Merrill Lynch: Today’s “Goldilocks” report suggests the business cycle still has another leg to go: the labor supply is increasing to meet the gain aggregate demand, preventing price pressures from building too aggressively. • Ellen Zentner, Morgan Stanley: Straight lines don’t exist in economics. Despite the move lower in the year-over-year pace of average hourly earnings (AHE), the underlying trend in wage growth continues to firm, in line with continued tightening in the labor market and rising productivity. • Joe Brusuelas, RSM US: “The job market continues to sizzle as the economy is in the early stages of absorbing a late cycle fiscal boost that will support a growth rate well above the long-term trend in 2018. The 313,000 job gain is more than triple that necessary to meet the demand of new entrants into the work force, which if it sustained will continue to put downward pressure on the unemployment rate. This will not be lost among an F.O.M.C. that leans hawkish in 2018 and points toward an increasing probability that the central bank will hike rates four times this year. How strong is this labor market? The increase of 806,000 in the labor force and 785,000 in the household employment estimate are robust and statistically significant, which is a rare two-for in the monthly labor report. This labor market is on fire and wage gains are in train.” • James Ingram, MB Capital: “February’s fall in average wage rise data takes some of the pressure off. But the creation of more than 300,000 jobs in February suggests it will return in the months to come. Throw in a potential trade war between the US and the EU and the US economy could be headed for a perfect inflationary storm later this year. An interest rate hike in March from the US Fed must now be all but nailed on.” Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . • Capital Economics: “We suspected that the flu epidemic and the unseasonably cold weather in January had depressed payrolls, but even we were caught out by the strength. Illness and weather also affected the earnings and hours worked data in January, with those effects unwinding in February.” Specifically, Ms. Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, is interested in the loans Apollo and Citigroup extended to Jared Kushner’s family real estate firm, reports Politico’s Playbook. Ms. Warren, along with Representative Elijah Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, Senator Tom Carper, Democrat of Delaware, and Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, sent letters to Apollo (the letter) and Citigroup (the letter) asking: “For the dates the loans were offered, conditions of the loan and a description of the process by which the Kushner Companies got the loans. It asks for ALL MEETINGS between the two firms and Kushner, and various details about those meetings. They request ALL DOCUMENTS from the loan process and whether any of the loans included foreign financing.” Context The New York Times reported last week that:  • Josh Harris, a founder of Apollo Global Management, was advising Trump administration on infrastructure policy last year and met with Mr. Kushner several times. Among other things, the two men discussed a possible White House job for Mr. Harris, which never materialized. In November, Apollo lent $184 million to Kushner Companies. The loan was to refinance the mortgage on a Chicago skyscraper Advertisement • Michael Corbat, Citigroup’s C.E.O., met with Mr. Kushner in the spring, and shortly afterward the bank lent Kushner Companies $325 million. Stephanie Clifford of the NYT reported: Martin Shkreli, a former pharmaceutical executive notorious for sharply increasing drug prices, mounting sneering defenses of his actions and even issuing a bounty for one of Hillary Clinton’s hairs, was sentenced on Friday to seven years in prison after being convicted of fraud last year. Last summer, a jury convicted Mr. Shkreli, nicknamed Pharma Bro, on three of eight counts , concluding that he had lied to investors about, among other things, how the hedge funds were managed, what they invested in and how much money they had. The jury found that he had also secretly controlled a huge number of Retrophin shares. Prosecutors had sought a sentence of at least 15 years; the defense had pushed for 12 to 18 months. Ben Sisario of the NYT writes: When Martin Shkreli, the disgraced former pharmaceuticals executive, is sentenced for securities fraud in Brooklyn on Friday, the government will have its pick of a number of his assets to satisfy the $7.36 million judgmentagainst him. There is a brokerage account with $5 million in cash, shares in his company Vyera Pharmaceuticals, even a Picasso. And then there is an item that has been the subject of worldwide intrigue: the sole copy of the Wu-Tang Clan album “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin,”packaged in a custom silver-and-nickel case and accompanied by a 174-page leather-bound book. It may be the most famous album ever kept in the possession of just one person. But what is it worth? The answer? It is complicated, though experts all doubt that the album could yield anywhere near the $2 million Mr. Shkreli apparently paid for the album at auction three years ago. President Trump authorized tariffs on imported steel and aluminum yesterday, defying allies and Republicans alike. But as Peter Eavis notes, the presence of exemptions for Canada and Mexico show more wiggle room than expected: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has leeway to exempt certain steel and aluminum imports from the restrictions if he determines that the United States lacks the capacity to produce them. There is also a national security exemption, notable since national security concerns are the legal basis for the tariffs. And Neil Irwin of the Upshot reckons that while we’re seeing a trade skirmish, it won’t necessarily become a trade war. (He also thinks it’s partly a negotiating tactic in the Nafta talks.) That hasn’t stopped trade partners  protesting. And in its lead editorial, The Economist wrote, “Not since its inception at the end of the second world war has the global trading system faced such danger.” The other China trade story: Mr. Trump tweeted that he has asked Beijing to reduce its trade deficit with the U.S. by $1 billion, adding, “We must act soon!” Elon Musk subsequently beseeched him on Twitter to tackle China’s restrictions on auto imports.

(Politico) Behind Cigna’s $67 billion (with debt) acquisition of Express Scripts is the idea that health insurance on its own is a challenged business. The C.E.O.s of the two companies said the union would help lower costs. But it’s also meant to help Cigna counter both UnitedHealth, the giant of the industry, and a combined CVS and Aetna. There’s skepticism: Cigna’s shares fell 11 percent yesterday. Matthew Borsch of BMO Capital Markets said that investors had hoped the insurer would buy something other than a business “under pressure, under scrutiny and to some degree in decline.” About that pressure: The F.D.A. has shown interest in lack of competition among drug benefits managers. David Balto, an antitrust expert, told the NYT, “History has shown where there are multiple mergers going on in a single industry, the Justice Department goes on high alert.” Advertisement Critics’ corner: Charley Grant of Heard on the Street writes, “Cigna has increased its vulnerability to industry changes rather than reduced it.” And Lex says of Express Scripts’ industry, “Like Seth Rogen comedies, they are a U.S. institution whose utility eludes other nations.” The deals flyaround • Toys “R” Us, yet to find a buyer, is preparing to liquidate its U.S. operations, unnamed sources say.

The Obamas already signed book deals reportedly worth $60 million. • While Mr. Obama doesn’t intend to take on his successor directly, will his likely choice of topics — like health care, immigration, voting rights — be seen as a counter to President Trump anyway? Elsewhere in media: The actor and producer Michael B. Jordan will adopt the use of “inclusion riders” in his production company’s projects. Disney will add a live-action “Star Wars” series to its forthcoming streaming service, to be directed by Jon Favreau. And Disney shareholders voted down a nonbinding endorsement of Bob Iger’s pay package.

You might need a hug. And Peter Eavis wonders: What happens when the bond market and the Fed disagree? It’s a bit like seeing the economy’s parents fight, he says.

 ___ Bids to curb health care costs offer little more than talk WASHINGTON (AP) — What began as bipartisan attempt to curb soaring health care premiums in the nation's health insurance markets is faltering in Congress. At fault are escalating demands from each party and erratic positions by President Donald Trump. Democrats want bigger federal subsidies for consumers under President Barack Obama's health care law. Republicans aim to relax its coverage requirements and win abortion restrictions. The bickering could collapse the whole effort, with each side blaming the other. ___ Trump says commerce secretary will talk tariffs with EU WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump says his commerce secretary will be talking to the European Union about tariffs that he argues have been unfair to the United States. Writing on Twitter, Trump says Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will speak with EU representatives about ""eliminating the large Tariffs and Barriers they use against the U.S.A.""

When owners haven't set aside enough money to cover their taxes, they do have options, including using savings, borrowing money or working out a payment plan with the IRS.

In a presidential order, Mr. Trump said “there is credible evidence” that led him to believe Singapore-based Broadcom’s control of Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, “might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.” Advertisement The extraordinary action by the president underscored the more forceful and protectionist action his administration has taken in recent weeks to protect American companies and ward off foreign investment in the United States. It followed an intervention this month by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which typically works behind closed doors and reviews deals only after they are announced, to stall the deal because of national security concerns. Advertisement From President Trump’s order: (a) There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that Broadcom Limited, a limited company organized under the laws of Singapore (Broadcom), along with its partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates, including Broadcom Corporation, a California corporation, and Broadcom Cayman L.P., a Cayman Islands limited partnership, and their partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates (together, the Purchaser), through exercising control of Qualcomm Incorporated (Qualcomm), a Delaware corporation, might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States; and (b) Provisions of law, other than section 721 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), do not, in my judgment, provide adequate and appropriate authority for me to protect the national security in this matter. Further down (e) The Purchaser and Qualcomm shall immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover. Immediately upon completion of all steps necessary to terminate the proposed takeover of Qualcomm, the Purchaser and Qualcomm shall certify in writing to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) that such termination has been effected in accordance with this order and that all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the proposed takeover of Qualcomm have been completed. Most C.E.O.s have to go to work each day and grind out better margins in highly competitive businesses that taxpayers won’t bail out if they blow up. This is now the fate that awaits the next C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs. In apparently priming David M. Solomon for the job, Goldman seems to be signaling that, even if trading revenue revives after some difficult quarters, it intends to press on with its efforts to bolster its nontrading businesses, like lending to corporations and consumers. Mr. Solomon, after a successful run as the head of Goldman’s powerful deal-making business, embodies in many ways the bank’s hopes to be far more than a high-octane trading shop. Of course, if the Trump administration guts Wall Street regulations, particularly the Volcker Rule, Goldman may be tempted to pile back into trading. But the bank’s recent track record in trading suggests that would not be a good idea. Not only does Goldman’s business that trades bonds, derivatives, currencies and commodities bounce around too much for shareholders’ tastes, it is opaque. Bank executives are often loath to talk in detail when it underperforms. Goldman also made strategic mistakes in this business in recent years. It focused too heavily on hedge fund clients, something it is trying to fix by reaching out to different types of customers. Its commodities business, which it clung to in the face of political pressure, has been a drawn out disappointment. And Wall Street traders ought not to get too excited about the prospects of deregulation. As some rules get loosened, others may get toughened up, like those that would liquidate a troubled Wall Street firm rather than bail it out. While the government may not be winding down any large banks anytime soon, the diminished likelihood of bailouts can force up the cost of borrowing for firms like Goldman. This, in turn, may steer them away from riskier businesses like trading. Investors still seem to doubt Goldman’s desire to adapt to a much more ordinary future. This is revealed in a comparison of Goldman and its rival, Morgan Stanley. Advertisement Goldman’s return on shareholder equity, a closely watched metric that quantifies the profits generated on shareholders’ money, has been higher than that of Morgan Stanley in recent years. But investors seem just as enthusiastic about the future of Morgan Stanley. Its stock trades at the same multiple to shareholders equity as Goldman’s. Why? Morgan Stanley has arguably done more than Goldman to diversify away from trading to businesses, like wealth management, that are more stable. — Peter Eavis David M. Solomon is Goldman Sachs’s heir apparent. The Wall Street firm said Mr. Solomon would serve as its sole president and chief operating officer, setting him up as the potential successor to Lloyd C. Blankfein, the investment bank’s longtime chief executive. Context Mr. Solomon and Harvey M. Schwartz were seen as the favorites to eventually replace Mr. Blankfein when they were named co-chief operating officers and presidents in December 2016. But, Mr. Schwartz, who previously served as the bank’s chief financial officer and global co-head of the securities division, has decided to retire in April, Goldman said on Monday. “Harvey has been a mentor to many, and his influence has made an indelible impact on generations of professionals at Goldman Sachs,” Mr. Blankfein said in a news release. “I want to thank Harvey for all he’s done for the firm.” Mr. Solomon joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 and previously served as co-head of its investment banking division. — Chad Bray Critic’s corner Anthony Currie of Breakingviews writes: “If Solomon does take the reins, it would end some 12 years of traders holding top positions at the Wall Street firm – and serve as another sign of Goldman’s troubles in that business.” Case in point: • Trading accounted for 53 percent of Goldman’s revenue in 2012. • It made just over a third of the firm’s revenue last year. Advertisement “Meanwhile, takings from merger advisory and stock-and-bond underwriting – Solomon’s world – increased by half over the past six years. So positioning him as likely heir would look like a way of rewarding past success.” Goldman’s reputation for advising companies in mergers and acquisitions is well earned. Most years, it tops the rankings of advisers by deal volume known as the league tables. So it was a bit surprising to see Goldman currently ranked fifth on both the global and the United States league tables. Here’s a look: Global  Morgan Stanley: $228.88 billion JPMorgan: $198.82 billion Bank of America Merrill Lynch: $138.76 billion Lazard: $134.39 billion Goldman Sachs: $131.56 billion United States Morgan Stanley: $132.36 billion Lazard: $119.69 billion JPMorgan: $114.37 billion Centerview: $112.75 billion Goldman Sachs: $102.54 billion Two points to note: 1) It is still early in the year and one big deal can reshuffle the rankings; 2) The value of transactions Goldman has advised on this year is up 31 percent from the same period a year ago. Larry Kudlow emerged Monday as the latest favorite in a changing rotation of potential replacements for Gary D. Cohn as the head the National Economic Council. The job has not been formally offered to Mr. Kudlow, but the CNBC television commentator, who has informally advised President Trump on economic issues, is likely to interview him in the coming days. Context From the NYT’s Maggie Haberman and Jim Tankersley:  Heading into the weekend, the top contender to replace Mr. Cohn was Christopher Liddell, who is a special assistant to the president working with the Office of American Innovation on a team led by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser. Mr. Liddell’s previous experience as a chief financial officer for Microsoft had been seen as a selling point. But after The New York Times reported that Mr. Liddell was under consideration, Mr. Trump received pushback from people both inside and outside the White House, according to the people close to the president. On Monday, The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board wrote a piece critical of Mr. Liddell’s views on free trade. On Sunday, Mr. Trump again began discussing Mr. Kudlow as an option, the people close to the president said. In a revised prospectus filed this morning, the online storage company said that it planned to sell 36 million shares at $16 to $18 a share. At the midpoint of that range, Dropbox would be valued at about $7.5 billion, compared to the $10 billion of its most recent private fund-raising. Advertisement The big thought: The Dropbox offering — along with that of Spotify — could show how interested Wall Street investors are in the latest batch of Silicon Valley “unicorns,” or privately held companies worth at least $1 billion. The man who made Dropbox: Meet Drew Houston, who created a multibillion-dollar business because he forgot to bring a USB flash drive one day while a student at M.I.T. His holdings could be worth nearly $1.7 billion The market for initial public offerings is on a tear, and, going by Dropbox’s latest financial filing, it may be getting a little overheated. Dropbox, a company that stores files on remote computers for consumers and businesses, on Monday said it aims to price its shares at between $16 and $18. The midpoint of those two prices would value Dropbox at around $6.8 billion, excluding some shares that may be awarded to executives in the future. That’s a lot, though about 30 percent below the $10 billion valuation it received after its fundraising round in 2014. At $6.8 billion, Dropbox would be trading at just over six times the $1.1 billion in sales it had for 2017. Companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index trade at 2.3 times sales. Dropbox would also have a higher valuation than Box, another file storage company, whose market value is 5.6 times the revenue it generated in its last fiscal year, which ended in January. Investors may, however, decide that Dropbox’s higher valuation is not justified. True, its sales grew at an impressive 31 percent last year, but that is not materially faster than the 27 percent Box achieved in its latest fiscal year. (Revenue grew 6.3 percent at companies in the S.&P. 500, according to FactSet.) Advertisement Neither company made a profit in their most recent fiscal year. Both are generating positive cash flows, though. And at $330 million last year, Dropbox’s cash flows were more than five times those of Box’s $62 million. If Dropbox went public at the $6.8 billion implied in Monday’s filing, it would trade at 21 times its 2017 cash flows. That is pricey, but that is less than half of Box’s cash flow multiple. — Peter Eavis Speculation has long swirled that Apple should buy Netflix.

From the outside, the Saudi businessmen (including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal) who were corralled into Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton — in what Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described as an anticorruption campaign — seemed to be in a gilded cage. The reality was far more disturbing. Many were physically abused and one captive was killed, witnesses told the NYT.

 LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO —  Streaming music leader Spotify used its cultural cool factor to appeal to mom-and-pop investors in an unconventional presentation ahead of its April 3 stock market listing. Led by 35-year-old Chief Executive Daniel Ek, wearing jeans, white t-shirt and a dark blazer, executives said Spotify would prioritize growth over profits to fend off big rivals Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc, while also seeing a clear path to making money. Ek's team made a direct case to individual investors in a public webcast instead of a traditional closed-door road show typically used to woo institutional investors in initial public offerings (IPOs). The Stockholm-based company's stock will hit the public markets in a direct listing without traditional underwriters. It must convince investors that its business is sound and that investors who buy shares in the public market debut will not be hurt by unexpected volatility. Advertisement ""You won't see us ringing any bells or throwing any parties,"" Ek said. ""Since Spotify isn't selling any stock in the listing, we're really entirely focused on the long-term performance of the business."" Advertisement The direct listing is critical to alleviating Spotify's losses, which are driven by financing costs, and will enable all late-stage investors to convert debt holdings into equity. Spotify's revenue grew 39 percent to 4.09 billion euros ($5.04 billion) in 2017 from 2.95 billion euros in 2016, it said in a securities filing. At the same time, net financing costs of 855 million euros pushed up operating losses to 378 million euros from 349 million euros. Chief Financial Officer Barry McCarthy, the former long-serving CFO of streaming video giant Netflix Inc, said Spotify's strategy was to prioritize growth before short-term profitability, and that greater scale would enable profit margins to swell. With 71 million subscribers at the end of 2017, Spotify is the leader in streaming music. It also has 92 million users of its free, advertising-supported service, which it says delivers a constant stream of converts to its paid offering. That will keep it ahead of Apple, the company believes. Tomas Otterbeck, an equities analyst with Swedish research firm Redeye, said he was impressed by McCarthy repeating the idea that ""We are playing a market share game"" and that Spotify could reach 100 million paying subscribers by early next year. The independent service is jockeying against efforts from Apple, which has 38 million paid listeners and eschews  advertising-supported services.  . Apple, Spotify, Google and other services charge around $9.99 a month for music subscriptions. Amazon Prime service subscribers can get the music service for $7.99 a month. Ek portrayed Spotify as an underdog not tied to a major technology company, describing a strategy to be a ubiquitous music service available across phones, computers, smart speakers and car entertainment systems. Advertisement Because the company will not issue any new shares, it did not specify a listing price. Based on private transactions, it is valued at roughly $19 billion, according to Reuters calculations. It has hired brokerage Morgan Stanley to match buy and sell orders to set its opening trading price and said it will provide financial guidance to investors on March 26. STAYING AHEAD McCarthy spelled out Spotify’s long-term operating targets for generating sustained free cash flow, with annual revenue growth between 25 and 35 percent and gross margin between 30 and35 percent - ambitious for a loss-making company. Helping listeners find new bands and songs is an ""infinitely larger"" opportunity in music than so-called discovery was for video, McCarthy said, comparing Netflix’s rapid rise from mail-order DVD distribution into a streaming media service to Spotify’s audio streaming business. Spotify could devour the $28 billion, advertising-driven radio market, he said. Advertising makes up only about 10 percent of Spotify's current revenue, and McCarthy said he would be ""thrilled"" if Spotify could pull in 20 percent of its revenue from ads, although he expressed some doubt about whether the company could hit that mark. “There is an enormous pay-off for whoever wins. Now it remains to be seen whether we will win, but that's the game we are playing,"" he said.

 LOS ANGELES —  Walt Disney Co said on Wednesday it had created a new unit for its streaming video and international businesses as the company retools its traditional media operation for a world rapidly embracing online video. Kevin Mayer, the company's chief strategy officer, was named chairman of the new division, which will oversee the upcoming ESPN+ digital offering and the launch of a family-oriented streaming service in late 2019, Disney said in a statement. The move, effective immediately, comes as Disney is in the process of purchasing film, TV and international businesses from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. Regulators are reviewing the deal, which has been complicated by Comcast Corp's offer for one of the assets, Britain's Sky Plc. Advertisement Disney also combined its theme parks business with the consumer products unit that licenses characters for toys, apparel and other merchandise. Bob Chapek, who heads the parks division, will lead the combined unit. Advertisement Media networks and the movie studio will remain separate units, Disney said. ""We are strategically positioning our businesses for the future, creating a more effective, global framework to serve consumers worldwide, increase growth, and maximize shareholder value,"" Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said in a statement.  . Disney's largest TV network, ESPN, has been losing subscribers as customers drop pay television subscriptions in favor of streaming services such as Netflix Inc. The company is responding with its own digital push. It is pulling its first-run movies from Netflix in 2019 to offer them on the Disney-branded service. If the Fox deal wins approval, Disney also will expand its programming portfolio and international reach, plus own a majority stake in the Hulu streaming service. Disney expects to switch its financial reporting to reflect the new structure by the beginning of fiscal 2019, the company said.

 The Walt Disney Company unveiled a sweeping reorganization on Wednesday, promoting a pair of executives and preparing the entertainment conglomerate for the eventual integration of assets from 21st Century Fox. Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, did not mention Disney’s pending $52.4 billion acquisition of various Fox businesses, which still must receive government approval, in Wednesday’s announcement. Instead, he described the new structure as “strategically positioning our businesses for the future.” Kevin Mayer, who has recently served as chief strategy officer, working on the purchases of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and BamTech, a streaming-focused company, was named chairman of a new Disney division: Direct-to-Consumer and International. The unit will be made up of Disney’s overseas media businesses; global advertising sales for ESPN, ABC and other channels; syndicated television sales; and — most important — a portfolio of subscription streaming services. Those services, designed to make Disney competitive with the likes of Netflix and Amazon, include ESPN Plus, which will be rolled out this spring. A second and still unnamed offering, built around the Disney, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Pixar brands, is expected late next year. Rounding out Disney’s streaming portfolio will be Hulu, an established service that focuses on older viewers with programming that includes ABC shows. Disney also promoted Robert Chapek, who has been chairman of Disney’s theme park division for the last three years. Mr. Chapek was named chairman of a new division called Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products, which adds merchandising, video games, book publishing and the Disney Store chain to his purview. Mr. Chapek was in charge of consumer products for Disney before he was promoted to theme park chairman in 2015. Advertisement The reorganization, which involves significant changes for every part of Disney except for the movie division, sets up a structure for Disney to absorb the Fox businesses. They include the Fox movie and television studio, a large portion of Hulu, 22 regional cable networks dedicated to sports, the FX and National Geographic channels, and stakes in two behemoth overseas TV service providers, Sky of Britain and Star of India. Advertisement The elevation of Mr. Mayer and Mr. Chapek was instantly read by some people in Hollywood as positioning either as a possible successor to Mr. Iger. Disney insiders cautioned against drawing that conclusion, however. To complete the Fox integration, Mr. Iger, 67, agreed to renew his contract for a fourth time, delaying retirement from July 2019 to the end of 2021. Rupert Murdoch, who controls 21st Century Fox, asked Mr. Iger to stay as a condition of the deal, which was valued at $66.1 billion including debt. As part of the restructuring, Andy Bird, the longtime chairman of Walt Disney International, is expected to leave the company. The management shuffling was announced a week after Disney named James Pitaro as president of ESPN. Mr. Pitaro previously oversaw consumer products. An earlier version of this article misstated the age of Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive. He is 67, not 66.

 Call it the “Big Little Lies” effect. Within 45 minutes on Monday night, there were separate announcements that Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman, stars of the Emmy Award-winning HBO series, will serve as executive producers and stars of two new projects. Ms. Witherspoon struck a deal to adapt the best-selling novel “Little Fires Everywhere,” by Celeste Ng, as a limited series for the streaming service Hulu. Ms. Witherspoon’s production company, Hello Sunshine, initiated the project and will produce it in conjunction with Kerry Washington’s Simpson Street and ABC Signature Studios. In addition to Ms. Witherspoon, the show will star Ms. Washington, the actress best known for her work on the ABC series “Scandal.” Ms. Kidman reached an agreement with HBO with her project, a limited series called “The Undoing,” based on the novel “You Should Have Known”, by Jean Hanff Korelitz. The veteran television hitmaker David E. Kelley, who has written every episode of “Big Little Lies,” will produce the show with Ms. Kidman, along with Bruna Papandrea, Ms. Witherspoon’s former producing partner. In the year since “Big Little Lies” premiered, Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Kidman have moved a number of projects toward production, including a second season of “Big Little Lies,” for which they persuaded Meryl Streep to join the cast. Advertisement The two Oscar winners’ moves into the ranks of powerful producers have been helped along by an entertainment industry that has changed dramatically with the entry of Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and Apple into the realm of big-budget series. The streaming platforms, eager to upend the old television order, are hungry for stars and spending freely to get them. HBO must join the competition if it hopes to maintain its position as a premium cable outlet for A-list programming. Advertisement The limited-series genre has been a hit with movie stars who prefer not to be tied into programs that can last for years. It is also popular with demanding audiences that may lose patience with a show at the first sign of narrative drift. Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Kidman are also taking advantage of an industry motivated by the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements to do a better job of telling stories of strong, complex women, in a space that has long been dominated by scowling male detectives, goofy sitcom dads and tortured antiheroes. In an interview with The New York Times this year, Ms. Witherspoon said it was not until September’s Emmys ceremony — during which “Big Little Lies” won multiple awards — that her phone started ringing in earnest. “I think it just clicked in people’s minds that this works economically and critically and that it was very well received,” Ms. Witherspoon said. Amazon, Hulu and Apple all showed serious interest in “Little Fires Everywhere,” but Hulu came through with the best offer.  . The platform — which is owned jointly by the Walt Disney Company, 21st Century Fox, Comcast and Time Warner — has some wind at its back after the success of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” which became the first streaming show to win an Emmy for best series. Hulu’s guerrilla marketing efforts for “The Handmaid’s Tale,” which included sending women dressed in red cloaks to walk around New York, Los Angeles and Austin, Tex., particularly impressed Ms. Witherspoon’s team. It probably didn’t hurt that ABC Signature Studios, a co-producer of the series, is owned by Disney, which will be the majority owner of Hulu if its planned acquisition of 21st Century Fox wins government approval. Advertisement “Hulu has a rich history of transforming groundbreaking literature into groundbreaking television, and we are confident that their talented team will use this story to spur a long-overdue dialogue around race, class and what it means to be a mother,” Ms. Witherspoon said in a statement. In addition to her deals with HBO and Hulu, Ms. Witherspoon is producing three shows for Apple — a series about a morning show, with Jennifer Aniston; a drama starring Octavia Spencer; and a comedy starring Kristen Wiig. The loser in Monday night’s pair of deals is ad-supported television. None of the broadcast networks or cable channels with critically acclaimed fare, like FX or AMC, were seriously involved in the bidding for “Little Fires Everywhere” or “The Undoing.” Show creators like sending their work out into the world without commercial interruptions. In the new Hollywood — where Apple is handing out fat checks and Netflix has given huge deals to Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy — creative producers are in very high demand. All they have to do now is make binge-worthy shows.

T2,13-Mar-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin MARCH 13, 2018
 Good Tuesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Memo to Qualcomm: National champions have to deliver. • How companies are planning on spending their tax savings. • Behind President Trump’s extraordinary block of Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm. • Meet Larry Page’s flying taxi start-up. • And what lies ahead for Goldman Sachs’s presumptive heir. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. President Trump has stepped in to protect Qualcomm from Broadcom, a foreign company that wanted to buy the San Diego-based chip maker. Rather than let market forces decide what should happen in the chip industry, the administration intervened because it had concerns about national security. One of the government's main worries, laid out in a March 5 letter, was that Broadcom would reduce Qualcomm’s spending on research and development, causing Qualcomm to lose ground in the race to develop important new technologies like 5G, which is designed to make wireless networks faster and more reliable. Chinese companies may gain an advantage in 5G, for instance. Advertisement Qualcomm does spend a lot on research and development. In its last fiscal year, the company’s $5.5 billion of research and development outlays were equivalent to 25 percent of its revenue. That was up from 21 percent on average in the preceding five years. According to Qualcomm executives, spending on 5G has driven the increase. Advertisement The big question is what Qualcomm does now. Will the company become less efficient under the government’s protection? Will it be tempted to spend less on research and development? If that spending falls markedly as a percentage of revenue, United States taxpayers may have reason to feel taken advantage of. — Peter Eavis The Trump administration seems to have taken a more activist role in mergers and acquisitions than past administrations. On Monday, President Trump blocked Broadcom’s hostile bid for Qualcomm. The move came just over three months after President Trump’s Justice Department drew plenty of attention for suing to block AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner. That’s roughly $200 billion worth of transactions. But the administration’s oppositions to M.&A. activity goes further, especially when it comes Chinese acquirers. Here’s a look at some of the other deals that ran into problems securing approval from the United States government: • In March, Changnong, a unit of Beijing Dabeinong Technology, scrapped plans to buy Waldo Farms after it failed to obtain United States government approval. • In September, the Trump administration blocks China’s Canyon Bridge Capital Partners’ $1.3 billion bid for Lattice Semiconductor over national security concerns. • In November, Cowen Group called off its deal for CEFC China Energy, a Chinese conglomerate with big investments in oil in Central Africa, to take a 20 percent stake in the New York boutique investment bank, blaming delays and “uncertainty” in securing Cfius approval. Advertisement • In January, MoneyGram and Ant Financial, the Chinese electronic payments company, canceled their $1.2 billion deal after failing to win approval from a Washington panel that reviews foreign purchases of American companies. This approach to deals is a reversal from the stance of past administrations on deal making. Writes Matt Levine of Bloomberg Views: If the shareholders would rather take the money and leave the business’s fate to the acquirer, the governmental reaction has traditionally been “ehh, what are ya gonna do, capitalism.” But now, maybe, not so much? With (selectively) reinvigorated antitrust enforcement, reinvigorated CFIUS review, and a president who sure seems happy to block mergers for political or personal-offense reasons, there are just a lot more ways to stop a merger, if that’s what you are looking to do. A decade ago, Bear Stearns was facing a grave liquidity crisis. Its stock had plummeted more than 20 percent in just days. Investors, as well as clients and broker-dealers, had pulled back from the firm, fearing that their continued exposure to plunging real estate assets threatened their solvency. Amid the chaos, the co-head of Goldman’s investment bank, David Solomon, reached out to an executive at Bear Stearns: 
            Ten years ago today, David Solomon called the CFO of his alma mater firm, Bear Stearns, to offer Goldman’s assistance. #StreetFighters pic.twitter.com/ow2zu6VIUB  The call left Sam Molinaro, Bear’s C.F.O., feeling uneasy. “When Goldman calls and offers their assistance, it's usually a moneymaking opportunity for them,” Mr. Molinaro said. Of course, within days, JPMorgan, with the backing of the Federal Reserve, had stepped in and agreed to acquire Bear for $2 a share. Mr. Solomon, meanwhile, was anointed the heir apparent at Goldman yesterday. When President Trump signed the sweeping tax overhaul into law late last year, he said, “Corporations are literally going wild over this.” We’re not ones to judge whether that’s an overstatement, but a new study has found that, at the least, many plan on going shopping. Here’s what a survey of 500 American companies with sales of at least $500 million by EY found: • 42 percent of respondents intend to use their tax savings on acquisitions • 73 percent of executives said that they will accelerate their M.&A. planning for the year in any case • 69 percent of respondents say that they’re likely to bring back more cash from overseas under the new tax code The responses to survey suggest that many of the predictions for how companies would use the proceeds from the tax overhaul may prove correct. Though many firms garnered headlines for doling out bonuses to employees or raising hourly wages, analysts and economists largely predicted that corporate America would turn to deal-making, dividends or share buybacks as ways to spend their money. Advertisement “At the end of the day, tax is not a driver of M.&A., but it certainly is a key element,” Bill Casey, EY’s Americas vice chair of transaction advisory services, told me. He added that the removal of uncertainty about taxes, as well as the potential benefits from the overhaul, appears to have lifted companies’ deal-making spirits. Not that M.&A. has been bad so far this year. Announced transactions in the United States for the year to date are up 55 percent from the same time last year, according to Thomson Reuters. And Mr. Casey pointed out that companies already have access to plenty of cheap financing to pursue acquisitions. But for mid-market companies especially, extra money in the pocket can help provide an extra shot of confidence. “There’s more capital being fueled by tax reform, and that will ultimately lead to a better deal market,” Mr. Casey said. Other findings from the survey • 75 percent of respondents said that they are likely to grow their United States manufacturing base in some way • 89 percent said that they planned to “enhance compensation” because of forthcoming tax benefits • 38 percent of mid-cap companies plan to create new jobs, compared to only 19 percent of large-caps • 66 percent are likely to pass some tax savings onto customers — Michael de la Merced Few deal makers that Michael has spoken to since last night can recall such a dramatic scenario: The president intervening in a hostile takeover, citing national security reasons. Advertisement President Trump essentially salted the earth for Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm. Broadcom was ordered to “immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover,” and its nominees for Qualcomm’s board, who had stood a good chance of winning most of the seats, were immediately disqualified. What John Kabealo, a specialist in foreign investment law, told Cecilia Kang and Alan Rappeport of the NYT: “It certainly aligns with the administration’s willingness to be more active in trade and implementing protectionist policies,” he said. “It is definitely a much more activist policy than the previous administration.” Scott Kennedy of the Center for Strategic & International Studies told Bloomberg, “This decision hangs a huge ‘not-for-sale’ sign on just about every American semiconductor firm.” Big question 1: Much has been made of this White House’s protectionism. But Cfius, the government panel that reviews deals for national security concerns, cited Broadcom’s “relationships with third-party foreign entities.” What does that mean? Big question 2: Did Broadcom — which sped up its efforts to move its legal headquarters to the U.S. in apparent defiance of Cfius’s orders — misplay this situation? Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . Big question 3: Does any non-U.S. bidder for an American company now need to worry about Cfius? Critics’ corner:  Brook Sutherland of Gadfly warns, “This should be a warning for future deal makers and would-be friends of Trump.” Considering Qualcomm’s prospects now, Lex says the company “has disappointed before — even without the president’s help.” Market reaction Shares of Qualcomm are down 4.5 percent, while Broadcom’s stock rose 1.7 percent. Rival chip maker Intel, which has been considering a number alternatives in response Broadcom’s pursuit of Qualcomm, gained 2.7 percent. Andrew took the wraps off the Alphabet C.E.O.’s well-hidden side project, which aims to be the Uber of self-flying aircraft before Uber can even get there. More from Andrew’s column: On Tuesday, Mr. Page’s company and the prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, will announce they have reached an agreement to test Kitty Hawk’s autonomous planes as part of an official certification process. The hope is that it will lead to a commercial network of flying taxis in New Zealand in as soon as three years. New Zealand has long been seen as safety-conscious, so its regulations for the vehicles could be a model in the U.S. and elsewhere. Now that the Wall Street titan has officially anointed an up-and-coming disc jockey — a.k.a. David Solomon, longtime investment banker — Lloyd Blankfein’s likely successor, it’s worth considering his priorities: From Dakin Campbell of Bloomberg: Blankfein and the board were impressed, insiders say, by Solomon’s proven ability to build businesses, the strength of the deal making team he assembled and his efforts to recruit and retain talent. Those qualities became even more valuable as the bank decided it had focused too much on hedge funds as trading customers, at the expense of corporations. And in an interview with the Virgin Group founder Richard Branson last month, Mr. Solomon suggested that Goldman — which has added consumer lending to its stable of services — “could move in your direction a little bit.” Advertisement The succession race was Wall Street’s most closely watched, with Mr. Solomon, the outsider investment banker, squaring off against a Goldman lifer and veteran trader, his fellow co-president Harvey Schwartz. From Kate Kelly of the NYT: Late last year, Mr. Schwartz approached Goldman’s lead director, the private-equity executive Adebayo O. Ogunlesi, with an ultimatum, according to people familiar with the exchange. Mr. Schwartz said that unless he was tapped as chief executive in the coming months, he would resign. Mr. Ogunlesi was noncommittal, these people said. Peter Eavis’s take: Morgan Stanley has arguably done more than Goldman to diversify away from trading into more stable businesses like wealth management. A stumble for Goldman’s deal business: It’s fifth in Thomson Reuters’s global league tables, behind Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Lazard. As the current front-runner to replace Gary Cohn, the CNBC commentator would become the White House’s top salesman for its economic policies — and one of the top internal supporters of free trade, when protectionism is ascendant. Why Mr. Kudlow, whose last formal Washington job was in the Reagan administration? From Maggie Haberman and Jim Tankersley of the NYT: Mr. Kudlow, who advised Mr. Trump during his campaign and after he became president, is someone with whom Mr. Trump has a rapport, and he is a media personality whom the president enjoys watching on television, according to aides. Just in time: Mr. Kudlow and Stephen Moore have an op-ed in today’s WSJ on the economy. From the piece: “Mr. Trump’s tax-cutting and deregulatory policies are already pushing out the supply curve, creating real growth that isn’t inflationary.” More context: The apparent discarding of the previous front-runner, Chris Liddell, is another blow to Jared Kushner, for whom he worked.

European carmakers said the tariffs might lead them reduce investment, and therefore jobs, in the U.S. Advertisement • Mr. Trump abandoned his promise of tougher gun rules opposed by the National Rifle Association, including raising the age limit to buy assault-style rifles.

T3,8-Mar-18,"Advertisement By DANIEL VICTORMARCH 8, 2018
 When Frances McDormand used the closing of her best actress acceptance speech at the Academy Awards on Sunday to promote inclusion riders, a contract clause for actors that would require filmmakers to meet diversity benchmarks in their cast and crew, she jolted the idea into national consciousness. It raised the question of when the first A-list star would insist on one in his or her own contract. That still hasn’t happened. But on Wednesday, the actor Michael B. Jordan took a step, announcing that his company, Outlier Society Productions, would adopt the rider for its projects. The announcement made him the first major actor to publicly adopt the idea since Ms. McDormand’s speech. But Mr. Jordan, the villain of “Black Panther” and the hero of “Creed,” gave no indication that he would require the rider for the blockbuster movies he performs in. Instead, Mr. Jordan pledged that Outlier would meet certain diversity requirements, though it was not immediately known what specific requirements the company would hold itself to. Advertisement “I’ve been privileged to work with powerful woman & persons of color throughout my career, and it’s Outlier’s mission to continue to create for talented individuals going forward,” he wrote on Instagram. Advertisement Outlier, founded in 2016, is producing “Raising Dion,” a 10-episode drama about a single mother raising a superhero. Mr. Jordan, one of the show’s executive producers, will also act in the series, which is due on Netflix in 2019.  . The company is also developing a reboot of “The Thomas Crown Affair,” and Mr. Jordan will make his directorial debut with an adaptation of “The Stars Beneath Our Feet.” It was not immediately known whether the inclusion rider would apply to those projects and others underway. A publicist for Mr. Jordan could not immediately be reached for comment. As explained by Stacy Smith, who researches gender equality in film and television at the University of Southern California, inclusion riders would increase the representation of women, people of color and members of L.G.B.T. communities on screen and behind the camera. As an example, it might require the cast be 50 percent female, 40 percent underrepresented ethnic groups, 20 percent people with disabilities and 5 percent L.G.B.T. people. Ms. Smith said she hoped top Hollywood stars would require the rider before they appear in films, making it difficult for studios to attract the biggest names without a commitment to diversity. On Thursday, Ms. Smith said she was thrilled that someone “at the heartbeat of culture” would offer his support. Other actors have reached out through representatives “on a fact-finding journey” but Mr. Jordan was the first to go public with his support of the idea, she said. “This is a win on every level,” she said. “We’re hopeful this is one of many to come.” We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

 NEW YORK — U.S. stocks rallied on Monday as fears of a global trade war ebbed with investors betting that U.S. President Donald Trump would back down on his threat to impose hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Strategists also cited rising oil prices and ebbing concerns after an Italian election for a relief rally in the three major U.S. equity indexes. Investors started to eye Trump's threat as a negotiating tool after he tweeted that Canada and Mexico could avoid his proposed tariffs if they ceded ground in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) talks. A lack of specific retaliatory measures from other countries was also reassuring, said Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist, Allianz Global Investors in New York.

 Good Monday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Fed is working on ‘material changes’ to Volcker Rule. • Will Quarles end the post-Volcker quiet? • Big foreign banks and the Senate’s deregulation bill. • S.&P. 500 futures are down amid tariff threats and Italy’s election results. • How Washington intervened in Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm. • The school protection industry is seeing business get busier. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Changes are coming to the so-called Volcker Rule, the post-financial crisis era measure intended to rein in aggressive trading by Wall Street banks. Advertisement The Federal Reserve is in the process of working with other regulatory agencies to make “material changes” to the rule. Randal K. Quarles, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, said the central bank is working toward rewriting portions of the Volcker Rule during a speech on Monday. Advertisement Mr. Quarles took issue with many parts of the rule — inspired by Paul Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman. Mr. Quarles said the rule was “an example of a complex regulation that is not working well,” and that the Fed is working on revisions to make the rule less burdensome to firms that do not have large trading desks. Mr. Quarles did not give a time-frame to revise the rule but said the Fed’s goal was to write something that would formally be submitted for public comment. He said regulators want to make “clearer and more transparent” what kind of trading is governed by the Volcker Rule — something he said has been a source of frustration for regulators and bankers. The Volcker Rule has been credited with curtailing the ability of banks to make risky and speculative trades for their own account — which some contend contributed to some of the excesses that led up to the financial crisis of a decade ago. — Matthew Goldstein The Federal Reserve is gearing up for a far-reaching overhaul of the Volcker Rule. The rule’s critics, including Randal K. Quarles, head of supervision at the Fed, say it is too burdensome on banks. But there may be one group of people who hope that the Fed doesn’t gut the rule: Investors in bank stocks. Since the Volcker Rule took effect in 2015, they’ve been able to worry much less about traders saddling their institutions with overwhelming losses. In fact, there hasn’t been a big trading meltdown at a large United States bank since the London Whale debacle at JPMorgan Chase, which happened prior to 2015 and arguably lit a fire under regulators to finalize the rule. Contrary to some analyses of the financial crisis, proprietary trading contributed to the weakness of financial system . Who can forget Morgan Stanley’s disastrous subprime wager that saddled the bank with $9 billion of losses? Advertisement And by shedding proprietary traders, banks may have dodged no end of bullets. When a star commodities trader, Andrew J. Hall, left Citigroup, there was concern that the bank lost a crucial money maker. But the hedge fund Mr. Hall ran after he left Citigroup suffered outsize losses. And the list of bank traders who later racked up big losses at hedge funds is not short. — Peter Eavis The retailer has rejected its founding family’s takeover offer. A group of Nordstrom family members, which control 21 percent of the company, had offered $50 a share for the shares it does not already own. The Special Committee has directed its advisors and management not to provide further due diligence information to the Group. Furthermore, unless the Group can promptly and substantially improve the price it is proposing to pay for the Company, the Special Committee intends to terminate discussions. It was a brash move, even by Wall Street’s standards. Deutsche Bank, a giant German bank with a big trading business in the United States, took emergency loans from the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis a decade ago. But later, Deutsche Bank changed the legal classification of its Wall Street operations, a step that for a time shielded it from United States banking regulations. Deutsche Bank’s actions, and those of other large foreign banks during that period, now loom over a piece of banking deregulation legislation that the Senate may approve this week. The bill loosens the part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the 2010 overhaul of the United States financial system, that imposed stricter regulations on larger banks, including foreign ones. Specifically, the bill — sponsored by Senator Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho — would lighten the regulation of banks that have less than $250 billion in loans, securities and other assets, a group that includes American banks like SunTrust and BB&T. But the bill’s critics are concerned that it would allow far larger foreign banks to chip away at rules designed to prevent them wriggling out of United States safeguards. The authors of the new bill reject such fears. “Folks are peddling a lot of misinformation about our bipartisan bill, but if you look at the bill text you will see that large foreign banks will be subject to the same enhanced prudential standards,” Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, said in a statement. “Our legislation provides targeted regulatory relief for local lenders in Montana and rural America.” (“Enhanced prudential standards” is the regulatory term for stricter rules.) And the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, speaking before a Senate committee last week, said he did not think the bill would allow foreign banks to operate under a softer set of rules. Advertisement Mr. Powell based his assertion on how Dodd-Frank is written. It states that banks over $50 billion in consolidated assets require stricter oversight. The new bill moves that up to $250 billion. But even though the likes of Deutsche Bank, UBS and Credit Suisse have less than $250 billion in United States assets, they have far more than that on a consolidated basis around the world. And since the new bill does not amend the part of Dodd-Frank that requires regulators to use consolidated assets, the Fed can continue to apply its enhanced regulations to foreign banks. So, why are opponents of the bill, like Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, concerned? They point to remarks made by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Congress earlier this year. When Senator Brown asked Mr. Mnuchin if he believed the new bill would reduce regulations for foreign banks, he said: “That is correct.” Indeed, the Treasury, when it set out its aims in a report last year for reducing financial regulations, included relief for foreign banks. (A Treasury official on Monday sought to clarify Mr. Mnuchin’s answer to Senator Brown. The official said Mr. Mnuchin was responding to the senator’s remarks about the Treasury’s report that came before his question about the impact of Senator Crapo’s bill.) Critics also point out that the Fed in part based its post-crisis rules for foreign banks on language in Dodd-Frank that required the rules establish fair competition between foreign and domestic banks. If the bill passes, and the Fed gives foreign banks no relief from certain regulations, the foreign banks could argue in a lawsuit that they are competitively disadvantaged against American banks with assets under $250 billion that did get such relief, some opponents of the bill contend. And the Fed did in one place veer from using consolidated assets when applying regulations to foreign banks. The Fed in 2014 said that foreign banks with less than $50 billion in United States assets (not a global consolidated measure) would be eligible for less stringent requirements under its foreign banking rule. That could create the grounds for raising that bar for lighter regulation from to $250 billion from $50 billion, critics of the bill argue. But supporters of the bill contend that United States laws give the Fed substantial leeway to continue applying stricter regulation to foreign banks. What might happen if Senator Crapo’s bill passes? It seems unlikely that big foreign banks are going to get an immediate pass from stricter regulations. But the pre-crisis period shows that, over a longer period, banks and their lawyers press for changes when they see regulators relax. — Peter Eavis The most dramatic story in M.&A. has taken another twist — one that raises questions about how assertively the Trump administration will regulate deal-making. Advertisement What happened: The U.S. government panel that reviews deals for national security concerns, known as Cfius, has asked Qualcomm to postpone its shareholder meeting, scheduled for tomorrow, by 30 days so it could further review Broadcom’s hostile takeover bid. Broadcom’s response pulled no punches, accusing Qualcomm of covertly reaching out to regulators: This was a blatant, desperate act by Qualcomm to entrench its incumbent board of directors and prevent its own stockholders from voting for Broadcom’s independent director nominees. Why: Members of Cfius have asked whether the takeover could put the U.S. behind China in the race for 5G wireless technology. Qualcomm’s biggest rival in the space is Huawei, and Qualcomm has argued that Broadcom, a serial acquirer and noted cost-cutter, could hurt crucial 5G research and development. (And Michael noted on Friday that there’s more to it than that.) Where the vote stands: Many early votes favored Broadcom: The shareholder advisory firms I.S.S. and Glass, Lewis recommended giving it at least four seats. But a top-30 investor, Parnassus, had said it supported Qualcomm. Michael hears that both sides have been especially focused on lobbying the biggest shareholders, BlackRock and Vanguard. The bigger picture: The White House has already blocked the sale of a U.S. tech company to a Chinese buyer on national security grounds. If it steps in here — in an unusually aggressive move by Cfius, which normally acts after a proposed deal is filed for review — would deal makers lose heart?

Background Then Google bought Zagat seven years ago under the direction of Marissa Mayer, who went on to become Yahoo’s chief executive. The plan was to integrate it into its mapping service, but life under Google has sometimes been rocky for the business, including a de-emphasizing of Zagat content in favor of Google’s own collected recommendations. About The Infatuation The company was founded nine years ago by Chris Stang and Andrew Steinthal, who a way to recommend restaurants and bars to their friends.

 FRANKFURT —  Broadcaster RTL Group will speed up a push into exclusive programming, offering locally focused video-on-demand services in its European markets in response to platforms like Netflix and Amazon. RTL, controlled by German publisher Bertelsmann, has weathered weak TV advertising demand better than rivals but is nonetheless accelerating a 'total video' strategy that seeks to address changing viewing habits. ""We are seeing the challenging TV markets in a macroeconomic development which is very prosperous – this is a very clear signal to us to accelerate our strategic execution,"" CEO Bert Habets told Reuters in an interview. RTL earlier reported solid 2017 results, with revenues up 2.2 percent to 6.37 billion euros (5.71 billion pounds). Earnings before interest, taxation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose by 3.8 percent to 1.46 billion euros, broadly in line with forecasts. Advertisement RTL, whose core markets are Germany, France and the Benelux countries, forecast revenue growth of between 2.5 percent and 5 percent this year. Core earnings would remain broadly unchanged, adjusting for a one-off gain from property sales last year. Advertisement RTL shares were 2 percent lower, amid broadly weaker sentiment towards the media sector after U.S. consumer products giant Procter & Gamble said it would cut spending on ad agencies. LOCAL VS GLOBAL The rise of the global platforms, and U.S. entertainment group Comcast's bid for Britain's Sky, threaten to marginalise European broadcasters that still rely on advertising for the bulk of their revenues. But, rather than take a leaf out of their book, RTL wants to focus on national audiences by offering more original programming, including via subscription services delivered as and when viewers want to watch. It plans new video-on-demand services in Belgium, Hungary and Croatia, all based on its existing French 6play platform.  . ""We are very confident to continue developing and investing in these on-demand services in all countries where we have a strong family of channels,"" said Habets, who recently became sole CEO at RTL. RTL has a strong background in game-show formats, but has backed production arm Fremantle Media's move into producing scripted television dramas. That has attracted the interest of the mega-platforms: Amazon recently commissioned Deutschland 86, the follow-up to an espionage serial that first aired on RTL in Germany. There's still mileage in the ad-driven TV model, said Habets, pointing to the outperformance of RTL's core franchises in Germany and France last year. Of total revenues, advertising still accounts for 47.5 percent, less that its main competitors. Advertisement The company wants to increase the share of digital revenues as a percentage of the total to 15 percent by 2020 from 13 percent last year. ""The power of linear TV will continue to be very strong, especially in the European markets, where fragmentation is ongoing, but less severe than in other continents of the world,"" said Habets. RTL said it would propose a final dividend of 3 euros per share, on top of an interim dividend of 1 euro paid last September, representing a dividend yield of 5.9 percent to its shareholders.

T1,22-Feb-18,"Advertisement Supported by By Michael M. Grynbaum WASHINGTON — A comedian has agreed to tell jokes at this year’s White House Correspondents’ Association dinner. Now the question is whether President Trump will show up to hear the punch lines. Michelle Wolf, a stand-up comic and frequent contributor to “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah,” will be the featured entertainer at the annual gathering on April 28, the association announced on Thursday, taking on one of the most prominent — and perilous — gigs in comedy. Long a high point of the Washington social calendar, the correspondents’ dinner typically offers journalists and presidents a chance to roast one another on live television in a celebrity-packed ballroom. But Mr. Trump, not one to encourage comity with the White House press corps, skipped last year’s proceedings, the first president to do so since Ronald Reagan in 1981. (Mr. Reagan, who had recently survived an assassination attempt, called in from his hospital bed.) And the White House said this week that Mr. Trump had not yet made a decision about this year. Either way, Ms. Wolf, 32, has her work cut out for her. Washington journalists are a notoriously tough crowd; witness the stony silence that met Stephen Colbert after his blistering 2006 monologue about George W. Bush. The comedian Larry Wilmore, who appeared in 2016, prompted controversy when he used a racial slur in his remarks about Barack Obama. The coziness of the event — where reporters hobnob with the politicians they cover — can be awkward, too, leading some journalists to stifle their laughter, lest they be caught on camera appearing too gleeful at the president’s expense. But the dinner can be a proving ground for comics. Hasan Minhaj, last year’s entertainer, received high marks for his balanced performance, coming at the height of tensions between Mr. Trump and the press. Ms. Wolf, who has also written for “Late Night With Seth Meyers,” recently signed a deal with Netflix to develop a weekly late-night talk show of her own. She gained notice last year for an HBO comedy special, “Nice Lady,” that Jason Zinoman, the comedy critic for The New York Times, praised for its “silly fart jokes tied to meaty social commentaries that spin out into unexpected personal confessions interrupted by nicely crafted one-liners.” Margaret Talev, a White House reporter for Bloomberg News who is president of the correspondents’ association, said that Ms. Wolf’s “truth-to-power style makes her a great friend to the W.H.C.A.” “Her Pennsylvania roots, stints on Wall Street and in science, and self-made, feminist edge make her the right voice now,” Ms. Talev said in a statement. If Mr. Trump attends the April dinner, it could create a far more charged dynamic in the room. The president rarely holds back in his searing attacks on the journalists who cover him, but might he temper his style in a more formal setting? An answer of sorts could come in early March when the president makes his first appearance at another of Washington’s major roasts: the white-tie Gridiron Club gala. The Gridiron, organized by an elite club of Washington journalists, is a more genteel version of the correspondents’ dinner, featuring skits and jokes performed by reporters and lawmakers. Outside comics are not invited, and the event is not expected to be televised. Mr. Trump skipped the event last year — Vice President Mike Pence spoke in his stead — but there is precedent for spotty presidential attendance: Barack Obama did not speak there until his third year in office. Of course, Mr. Trump’s history with the correspondents’ dinner is more fraught. In 2011, the future president attended the event, only to be brutally mocked by Mr. Obama and the featured entertainer, Mr. Meyers. Mr. Trump’s displeasure that evening has since been cited as a prime motivator for his subsequent presidential run.    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS One subscription.Endless discovery.

 LONDON — Comcast may have found a way to disrupt Walt Disney Company’s plan to buy most of 21st Century Fox: topping Fox’s bid to buy the British satellite broadcaster Sky with its own $31 billion takeover offer. The bid, plans for which were announced on Tuesday, seizes upon 21st Century Fox’s difficulties buying the piece of Sky that it does not already own. British regulators have expressed repeated concerns about giving Rupert Murdoch and his family more control over the country’s media, stretching the approval process out over more than a year and forcing 21st Century Fox to offer more concessions. Comcast has said that buying Sky would help it expand in Europe, where the broadcaster has 23 million customers and owns rights to show the English Premier League and other professional soccer leagues. Disney, too, has been keen on expanding internationally, with the British company serving as an important part of its $52 billion plan to buy a significant portion of 21st Century Fox. Whoever prevails, it will shake up Disney’s plans. Either 21st Century Fox will have to pay more for Sky, or Disney will lose a valuable international property to Comcast. Advertisement In a statement, 21st Century Fox said that it “remains committed to its recommended cash offer for Sky,” which it made in 2016. Advertisement Disney, Comcast and others are rushing to strike major deals in a swiftly changing media landscape. AT&T has bid more than $85 billion to take over Time Warner, a proposed merger that the Justice Department is attempting to block. Consumers increasingly stream their movies and televisions shows over the internet. Upstart technology companies like Apple and Amazon nurture ambitions to rival Hollywood’s big studios. Online broadcasters are even increasingly bidding for the rights to show sports — long a major moneymaking business for traditional broadcasters and cable operators. The saga over Sky has been one of the most drawn out deal-making dramas in media. Mr. Murdoch, the 21st Century Fox executive chairman, has tried for years to take full control of the broadcaster, which he started in 1989. By owning the rest of Sky, 21st Century Fox would be better positioned to take on the likes of Netflix, Amazon and other streaming giants. In 2011, Mr. Murdoch was forced to withdraw a $12 billion offer for the rest of Sky as a firestorm erupted over phone hacking by the news media in Britain. The scandal eventually led to the closing of The News of the World, the first newspaper Mr. Murdoch acquired in Britain in the late 1960s. In December 2016, 21st Century Fox tried again, in an effort to expand its global reach and cement Mr. Murdoch’s legacy. The company agreed to buy the 61 percent of Sky that it does not own for about $16 billion. While the Office of Communications, or Ofcom, ruled in June that Mr. Murdoch and other company executives were “fit and proper” to hold broadcasting licenses in Britain, it also said that the deal warranted more scrutiny. In the regulator’s view, the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News had amounted to “significant corporate failures.” Then last month, Britain’s competition regulator provisionally rejected the deal, saying that it was “not in the public interest.” The regulator said it was concerned that the deal would give the Murdoch family “too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda.” It noted at the time that Murdoch-controlled outlets, which include the newspapers The Sun and The Times of London, were already consumed by nearly a third of Britain’s population. In hopes of winning over regulators, 21st Century Fox has offered to establish a “fully independent” editorial board for Sky News and to continue to fund the Sky News brand after the transaction for at least 10 years. Advertisement 21st Century Fox had hoped to complete the Sky deal before the Disney sale was finalized. But Comcast’s move just adds uncertainty to an already complicated process. Disney, which declined to comment on Comcast’s proposal, must now decide how much it cares about Sky. It is also not clear if Disney would want to end up being partners with Comcast, in the event that Comcast wins majority control of Sky and Disney ultimately has Fox’s 39 percent stake. While announcing the planned purchase of Fox’s entertainment assets in December, Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, singled out Sky as “a real crown jewel” in a television interview with Bloomberg. “We certainly would be looking forward to the opportunity to have Sky be part of our company,” he said.  . Comcast has circled 21st Century Fox in the past. Last year, the cable giant was in preliminary talks to buy the entertainment assets owned by 21st Century Fox, including the minority stake in Sky. Disney ultimately prevailed. At the very least, Comcast has most likely made it more expensive for 21st Century Fox to buy all of Sky. Under the terms of its proposed bid, Comcast said, it would pay 12.50 pounds, about $17.50, a share in cash. That would represent a premium of 13 percent over its closing price on Monday and is about 16 percent above 21st Century Fox’s current offer of £10.75. On Tuesday, shares of the British broadcaster jumped by nearly one-fifth. The stock surge suggested investors expected 21st Century Fox to back away or come back with an even better offer. Comcast shareholders seemed less pleased. The company’s stock price dropped more than 6 percent in midday trading, to about $37. Disney shares fell 4 percent, to about $105.50, and Fox shares declined 2.6 percent, to about $37.80. An influential media analyst, Craig Moffett, who follows Comcast for MoffettNathanson, wrote in a research note that the Sky offer had positive aspects, including offering Comcast’s entertainment unit, NBCUniversal, broader distribution in Europe. Still, “Comcast will have to twist themselves into knots to explain why satellite distribution won’t be just as obsolete in Europe as it already is in the U.S.,” Mr. Moffett said. “Perhaps worst of all, this morning’s bid doesn’t really put to rest the idea that they might still try a topping bid for Fox’s U.S. assets, including the rest of Sky” if the Justice Department ends up approving AT&T’s takeover of Time Warner. Advertisement “The notion that Comcast might make a topping bid for Fox has weighed heavily on Comcast shares,” he added. For either Comcast or Disney, Sky offers a platform for international expansion. Comcast said in a statement that about a quarter of its revenue would come from international operations should it seal a deal with Sky, up from 9 percent currently. In addition to its other businesses, Sky has also announced plans to start streaming services in Spain and Switzerland. “We look at Sky as a media company: Sky News, Sky Sports, Sky Movies,” Brian L. Roberts, Comcast’s chairman and chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts. “There’s tremendous presence in the content creation, not just the distribution.” In a research note on Tuesday, Polo Tang, a UBS analyst, said that Sky could be “strategically interesting” to a variety of bidders, given its content and its broadcast and streaming distribution network. It also recently retained the rights to the Premier League at a lower cost than analysts had expected. Mr. Tang said that the benign outcome of the Premier League auction potentially “gives Fox scope to raise its offers.” Comcast said it was seeking control of more than half of Sky’s shares with Tuesday’s offer but was ultimately interested in acquiring all of the British broadcaster. In a statement, Sky urged shareholders to take no action yet. The broadcaster added that its independent directors “are mindful of their fiduciary duties and their obligations under the U.K. Takeover Code.” Follow Chad Bray on Twitter: @Chadbray Brooks Barnes contributed reporting from Los Angeles.

The offer, writes Liam Proud of Breakingviews, leaves Fox with two unappealing options to save its deal with Disney. Rupert Murdoch can either “revise the terms of the Disney sale to exclude Sky, or enter into a bidding war with” Comcast. Advertisement Sky investors seem to be betting on the latter option. Its stock jumped nearly 20 percent and is now trading above Comcast’s offer. Advertisement The reason for that may be that “both Fox and Disney have reasons for wanting to possess all of Sky,” writes Chris Hughes of Bloomberg Gadfly. “Fox may want full ownership as an insurance policy against the sale to Disney failing. And Disney’s desire to buy Fox’s current stake in Sky suggests it likes the asset, wants more of it and would want to prevent Comcast owning it.” In fact, Robert Iger, Disney’s chief executive, has called Sky the crown jewel of his company’s purchase of Fox assets. Reaction • Frank Louthan, an analyst at Raymond James: “The potential for Fox to return and make a competing bid remains high, in our view, as our European investment team believes Sky is the best-in-class European leader in Pay-TV.” When is an offer an offer can be a fine point under Britain’s complicated takeover rules. On Tuesday, Comcast announced a “possible all-cash offer” to acquire Sky, the British satellite broadcaster, for about $31 billion . Sky and 21st Century Fox, which has been trying to acquire the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own for more than year, both responded that “no firm offer” had been made. That may seem like an odd distinction when Comcast, the owner of NBCUniversal, announced publicly how much it is willing to pay for an asset to kick off negotiations. But, that comes down to Britain’s extensive takeover code, which spans more than 400 pages, and can often trip up American companies not used to operating under those rules. The public disclosure of merger talks is triggered under the code when a number of factors occur, such as rumors in the market that a deal is in the works or “untoward movement” in a takeover target’s stock price. Advertisement Making a public announcement then starts a countdown clock for a potential acquirer to announce a formal offer under the rules, known as a so-called firm intention to make an offer. The rules are intended to make sure all shareholders are treated fairly and have access to the same information about a deal and to establish an orderly framework for takeovers. - Chad Bray We’d waited to see if Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chairman and C.E.O., would challenge Walt Disney for control of 21st Century Fox. Instead, he plans to disrupt Mr. Murdoch’s bid for full control of Sky, the British satellite broadcaster. What Comcast is offering: £12.50, or about $17.50, a share for all of Sky What Fox is offering: £10.75 a share for the 61 percent of Sky that it doesn’t own Behind the maneuvers Comcast had worked on its own offer for Fox, with the chance to expand internationally through Sky being a big reason for bidding. But the Murdochs and their advisers believed that it would be difficult for Comcast to win U.S. regulatory approval. However, Fox’s bid for Sky has been held up by questions by British regulators about whether Mr. Murdoch was fit and proper to control a major broadcaster in the U.K. That presented Comcast’s opportunity. What Mr. Roberts said in Comcast’s regulatory statement: “We already have a strong presence in London, and Comcast intends to use Sky as a platform for our growth in Europe.” Whom to thank for the Comcast bid 
            Someone needs to find this cabbie pic.twitter.com/lH4SFcggcp  Critics’ corner • Paul Richards of the media research firm Numis told the FT that Comcast’s bid is a “very strong competitive offer.” Advertisement • Alex DeGroote at Cenkos Securities told Bloomberg, “The market was anticipating another approach and will be pleasantly surprised.” Market reaction Comcast investors don’t seem pleasantly surprised. Shares of Comcast are down 5.2 percent. Sky’s stock popped nearly 20 percent and is now trading above Comcast’s offer. When Jerome H. Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday, we may see if he has mastered the art of stern but subtle disapproval. Congress has recently enacted tax cuts and spending increases that could stimulate the economy at a time when the Fed may want to tamp things down a bit. A tug of war could end up occurring between elected politicians wanting a boom to continue and a central bank that is concerned about government deficits and inflation. It is highly unlikely that Mr. Powell or any other Fed official would want to get drawn into a direct, public fight with members of Congress or the administration of President Donald Trump. So, how might Mr. Powell express concern about loose government fiscal policies? He can talk about Congress’s stimulus as just one of many factors that can have an impact on the Fed’s mission of creating the economic conditions for maximum employment and stable prices. In other words, he could depersonalize any tensions, and imply that concern about spending and deficits is just the Fed doing its job. And in his prepared testimony for the hearing, Mr. Powell noted the stimulus from fiscal policy. “In gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the F.O.M.C. will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing P.C.E. price inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis. While many factors shape the economic outlook, some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds: In particular, fiscal policy has become more stimulative and foreign demand for U.S. exports is on a firmer trajectory.” (F.O.M.C. is the Federal Open Market Committee, the committee that sets monetary policy, while P.C.E. price inflation is the Fed’s preferred measure of prices, derived from a survey of personal consumption expenditures conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.) Update from the hearing In this testimony before the House committee on Tuesday, Mr. Powell took some questions about the recent loosening of fiscal policy, and how the Fed might respond. Advertisement He followed the careful path outlined above. On the one hand, he noted that government finances can have an impact on economic conditions, saying: “Fiscal policy changes can have an effect.” He also said: “We really need to get on a sustainable fiscal path, and the time for doing that is now.” On the other hand, Mr. Powell said the Fed did not want to directly interfere in government spending decisions. “We don’t do fiscal policy at the Fed,” he said. — Peter Eavis That’s according to GeekWire and confirmed by CNBC.

T1,28-Feb-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin FEB. 28, 2018
 Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Spotify files to go public. • Dick’s Sporting Goods will stop selling assault-style rifles. • The end of an era for Ackman; the start for another one? • What to make of Wall Street’s response to Mr. Powell? • The Federal Reserve is walking a monetary tightrope. • And is Jared Kushner’s weakness his family business? Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Perhaps more than any other streaming service, Spotify has revived the fortunes of recording artists. It is funneling billions of dollars from its subscribers to music companies, which, for the most part, faced a bleak future. But a charity Spotify is not. The company appears to be taking a bigger and bigger cut of the revenue it receives from listeners, according to numbers first made public on Wednesday. Advertisement The numbers are included in Spotify’s financial filing with Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of listing its shares on the United States stock market. They strongly suggest that Spotify has successfully flexed its muscle as it negotiates the price it pays record companies for music. This shows up starkly in the filing’s discussion of an expense item called cost of revenues, which, the filing says, “consists predominately of royalty and distribution costs related to content streaming.” Advertisement The filing says Spotify had €3.67 billion of premium streaming revenue last year. The cost of that revenue last year was €2.87 billion. The difference between those numbers, the gross profit on streaming revenue, was equivalent to 22 percent of that revenue. That is well up from 16 percent in 2016 and 15 percent in 2015. And how did Spotify bolster its margins? A big factor: It signed more advantageous licensing agreements with music companies. “This decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of premium revenue was driven largely by a reduction in content costs pursuant to new licensing agreements,” the filing said. But can Spotify keep turning the screw? The music companies might be willing to compromise on price because the overall amount of dollars they receive is going up, making life easier for the first time in years. But, with Apple, Amazon and others adding subscribers, competition is intensifying. The music industry might be able to exploit that. — Peter Eavis Accounting nerds delving into Spotify’s filing will have stumbled on an odd discrepancy. Two metrics that attempt to capture how much cash a company is taking in had very different totals for 2017. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was negative to the tune of €324 million last year. But net cash flows from operations totaled €179 million in 2017. Both totals benefited from adding back large noncash financing costs. So what items bolstered operating cash flows but not Ebitda? It looks like operating cash flows did better in part because Spotify waited to pay some of its bills. Such items make up what is often called working capital. Spotify wrung €439 million of cash out of working capital in 2017. The question for investors is whether the company can do that every year. — Peter Eavis The streaming music service filed its prospectus for a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange, an unusual route that bypasses the traditional initial public offering process. Direct listings essentially move trading in a company’s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market. Advertisement Wall Street and Silicon Valley will watch Spotify’s listing closely. If it goes well, it could spur other high profile start-ups to pursue a direct listing. Wall Street bankers are unlikely to cheer such a development. Direct listings generate lower fees than the typical I.P.O. Spotify won’t embark on its roadshow, a series of meetings with investor ahead of the listing, for at least 15 days. Here’s a look at the details: Ticker symbol: SPOT Price range for private shares in 2017:  $37.50-$125.00  Price range for private shares this year:  $90.00-$132.50 Valuation range in 2017: $6.3 billion to $20.9 billion Valuation range this year: $15.9 billion to $23.4 billion Valuation based on the midpoint of its 2018 price range: $19.7 billion Loss: €1.2 billion in 2017, up from €225 million in 2015 Operating loss: €378 million, compared with €235 million in 2015. Revenue: €4.1 billion last year, up from €1.9 billion in 2015. Free cash flow: €109 million in 2017 Ebitda: -€324 million in 2017 Monthly average users: 159 million last year, up from 91 million in 2015 Premium subscribers: 71 million, up from 28 million in 2015 Share of global streaming music market: 42 percent Advertisement The amount Spotify has paid in royalties to record labels since its inception: More than $8 billion Percent of total voting power controlled by co-founder and chief executive, Daniel Ek: 37.3 percent Percent of total voting power controlled by co-founder, Martin Lorentzon: 43.1 percent Risks of a direct listing: “Our ability to sell your ordinary shares at or above the price you bought them for due to (i) our listing not having the same safeguards as an underwritten initial public offering, which may result in the public price of our ordinary shares being volatile and declining significantly upon listing, or (ii) the failure of an active, liquid, and orderly market for our ordinary shares to develop or be sustained.” Despite a sharp selloff in financial markets in early February, the market for public offerings started 2018 with a bang. Through late February, 30 companies publicly listed their shares on markets in the United States, raising $11.4 billion from investors. That was the strongest annual start for the market since 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters. The pipeline of listings to come is also strong. On top of Spotify’s listing, which should come in the next few weeks, Dropbox filed paperwork last week to go public. One of the U.S.’s biggest gun sellers, Dick’s Sporting Goods, said that it would stop selling assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines, as well as limit sales of any gun to those 21 and older. In doing so, the retailer is steering directly into the controversy that has embroiled companies that have taken on the American gun lobby. Dick’s C.E.O., Edward Stack, told the NYT: “When we saw what happened in Parkland, we were so disturbed and upset. We love these kids and their rallying cry, ‘enough is enough.’ It got to us.” What’s next: Mr. Stack wants what he calls “common sense” changes to gun laws, like the steps his company is taking and broader universal background checks. Advertisement Why it’s remarkable:  Other companies, big and small, continue to sever ties to the National Rifle Association. Delta has been openly dressed down — and potentially punished — by Republicans in Georgia after eliminating discounts for N.R.A. members. (Gun control is certainly a hot topic in the midterm election campaign.) And then there’s this: FedEx and UPS are feuding over ties to the N.R.A. Over five years ago, Bill Ackman boldly announced that he was shorting Herbalife, declaring the company a pyramid scheme and vowing to see its stock price down to zero. Today, Mr. Ackman finally gave up on that quest. The Pershing Square Capital Management chief told CNBC that his firm had finally exited the short bet. That’s after: • Mr. Ackman’s frenemy, Dan Loeb, took the other side of that bet. • So did Carl Icahn, in one of the most prominent public spats in recent Wall Street history, before the two men made up. (That didn’t stop Mr. Icahn from continuing to bet on Herbalife.) How did Herbalife investors respond Wednesday? They pushed shares in the company up 8.5 percent to $94.04, an all-time high. But Mr. Ackman has found a new investment: United Technologies. Why? The hedge fund mogul told CNBC that he liked the company — which happens to be considering spinning off parts of itself as a way to get more value for the conglomerate’s shareholders. Shares in United Technologies were up 2.1 percent this afternoon, at $136.73. — Michael de la Merced For months, the former real estate investor’s inability to get a permanent top-secret security clearance has been a lightning rod for criticism. Now his interim credentials have been docked to secret and his West Wing portfolio clipped — and people are asking what happened. Advertisement One thing that has come up, per the WaPo, citing unidentified U.S. officials: Officials in China, Israel, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates have discussed how to manipulate him by taking advantage of his business dealings and complicated finances. Speaking of the Kushner business: It’s is in talks to buy Vornado out of 666 Fifth Ave., the troubled Manhattan skyscraper that the two own, according to the WSJ. Critics will ask, where would the money come from? Is it scaring off users? So far the answer seems to be no. CNBC reports Snap’s download rates have remained strong, according to App Annie. And Snap’s shares are up 5 percent. Background Snap’s redesign, which has been rolling out over the past few months, has faced growing criticism from users and weighed on the stock. Last week a tweet from Kylie Jenner, saying she did not open Snapchat, sent the stock tumbling 6 percent. Wall Street has picked up on the customer backlash and a couple of analysts have downgraded the stock. The criticism has also overshadowed Snap’s positive fourth-quarter results earlier this month that pushed its shares up nearly 50 percent. BlackRock thinks that could be a risk to its business. From the risk factors in BlackRock’s annual report: As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of third-party commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing, as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries, known as “common ownership”. The commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows, create stock price bubbles, or conversely, exacerbate a decline in market prices. The filing goes on to say: If the conclusions advanced by such commentators were to gain traction or result in the enactment of policy measures that place limits on asset managers, BlackRock’s business operations, reputation or financial condition may be adversely affected. That is how John D. Herrmann, an analyst who covers the bond markets for MUFG Securities Americas, reacted to the testimony in Congress of Jerome Powell. In a note to clients yesterday, Mr. Herrmann cataloged upbeat remarks that Mr. Powell made, and observed that Mr. Powell seemed optimistic not just about the current economic environment, but also the outlook for the next three to four years. What to make of Wall Street’s response to Mr. Powell? One interpretation is that Mr. Powell wants investors and others to be more prepared for higher interest rates. Wall Street seems to have settled on a scenario in which the Fed raises interest rates steadily over the next two years. Any sign that rates may rise much more quickly than expected could cause a panicky pullback in the financial markets, which could ultimately harm the economy. Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . To help prevent that, Fed officials can say things aimed at prompting investors to give more consideration to certain outcomes. Advertisement Is it working?  Arguably, if investors were more concerned, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note would be higher than the 2.88 percent it traded at on Wednesday morning. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is forecasting the 10-year Treasury yield will be 3.25 percent at the end of this year. Anyone surprised that the yield gets there far more quickly should not be after Mr. Powell’s testimony. — Peter Eavis • Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has floated the idea of rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, more than a year after President Trump walked away.

And Sky has reach beyond the U.K. market. It is a Pan-European operation, with businesses in Britain, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain and Switzerland.
