 WASHINGTON/BEIJING —  U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports and will target the technology and telecommunications sectors, two people who had discussed the issue with the Trump administration said on Tuesday. A third source who had direct knowledge of the administration's thinking said the tariffs, associated with a ""Section 301"" intellectual property investigation, under the 1974 U.S. Trade Act begun in August last year, could come ""in the very near future."" While the tariffs would be chiefly targeted at information technology, consumer electronics and telecoms, they could be much broader and the list could eventually run to 100 products, this person said. The White House declined to comment on the size or timing of any move. Trump is targeting Chinese high technology companies to punish China for its investment policies that effectively force U.S. companies to give up their technology secrets in exchange for being allowed to operate in the country, as well as for other IP practices Washington considers unfair. Advertisement The Trump administration is also considering imposing investment restrictions on Chinese companies over and above the heightened national security restrictions, but details on these were not immediately known. A U.S. Treasury spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Advertisement But lobbyists in Washington expressed concern that Trump's ambitious tariff plan would also include other labor-intensive consumer goods sectors such as apparel, footwear and toys. Higher tariffs on these products would ""hurt American families,"" said Hun Quach, a trade lobbyist for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. ""We're not talking about fancy cashmere sweaters, we're talking about cotton T-Shirts and jeans and shoes that kids wear for back-to-school,"" she added. ""Alarm bells are ringing."" China runs a $375 billion trade surplus with the United States and when President Xi Jinping's top economic adviser visited Washington recently, the administration pressed him to come up with a way of reducing that number. Trump came to office on a promise to shield American workers from imports and his first action as president was to pull the United States out of the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. His administration is in the midst of negotiations to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and last week announced the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. While the tariffs on steel and aluminum, announced last week by Trump, are viewed as relatively insignificant in terms of imports and exports, moves to target China directly risk a direct and harsh response from Beijing. Advertisement ""If this is serious, the Chinese will retaliate. The key question is, does the U.S. retaliate against that retaliation,"" said Derek Scissors, a China trade expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a pro-business think tank. That would spook stock markets, but Scissors said that the more serious the conflict became, the worse China's position would become, due to the importance of its U.S. trade surplus.  . ""Their incentive to negotiate is to head us off from a major trade conflict."" NOT BIG ENOUGH The news website Politico earlier reported that the U.S. Trade Representative's office had presented Trump with a package of $30 billion in tariffs last week, but Trump told aides that this was not high enough. One Washington business source who had discussed the issue with the White House said the figure had now grown to about $60 billion, with a potentially wider array of products under consideration. A second person, who is an industry lobbyist in Washington  familiar with the administration's thinking, said the process was being led by Peter Navarro, an avowed protectionist, and by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who also favors tariffs as a tool to rebalance trade. Speaking to reporters in the Capitol, U.S. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady stressed that Trump was serious about addressing the issue of intellectual property theft with China. ""He's serious about calling their hand on this, and my understanding is they are looking at a broad array of options to do that,"" Brady said. U.S. business groups, while uneasy about triggering Chinese  retaliation, have increasingly pressed Washington to take action on Beijing's industrial policies, such as market access restrictions and the ""Made in China 2025"" plan, which aims to supplant foreign technologies with domestic ones. Shortly after Trump took office, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a U.S. technology think tank whose board includes representatives from top companies such as Apple, Amazon, Cisco, Google, and Intel, called for coordinated international pressure on Beijing. Advertisement While complaints about China's abuse of intellectual property rights are not confined to the United States, Trump's global steel and aluminum tariffs announced last week under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 complicate U.S. efforts to recruit allies to put pressure on China. A senior European diplomat in Beijing said China would be relieved to see Europe and Washington at odds over the metals tariffs. ""China's biggest worry has always been joint push-back from its major Western trading partners,"" the diplomat said. A China-based business source with knowledge of discussion among senior European officials said there had been a ""clear effort"" by the U.S. government over the past six months to introduce a coordinated approach to Chinese industrial policy, but that Trump's metals tariffs had undermined European support. ""Senior Trump administration officials had directly approached European leaders at a senior level. There had been a willingness to do something together on China. That's impossible right now. You can't cooperate when you're getting whacked around,"" the person told Reuters.

 PIERRE, South Dakota —  The woman walked into Cash Hogen's hardware store last fall to ask a single question about a KitchenAid mixer on display: What did the manufacturer call that color scheme? “Tangerine,” replied Hogen. And with that, the woman walked out. It is a kind of customer interaction that happens often these days, said Hogen, who has run his store in Pierre, South Dakota's downtown historic district since 1983. People come in to look at a product, ask a question or two, then leave, presumably to search for it more cheaply online. Retailers even have a name for the practice: “showrooming.”  “It’s just a gut feeling that she’s not buying it from me,” he said. One reason customers shop elsewhere, Hogen says, is that even when he can compete on price, he has to charge sales tax, which ups the ultimate price of his merchandise. The mixer, for example, normally has a $399.99 price tag in Hogen’s store, on top of which he has to charge $26 in state and local sales taxes. Some online retailers sell the mixer at the same price or lower, with no sales tax and free shipping. Advertisement That sales tax differential is at the core of a case that will come before the U.S. Supreme Court on April 17, and the stakes are high not only for store-keepers like Hogen, but also for online retailers, for state governments and for bargain-hunting consumers. Advertisement The case stems from a South Dakota law passed in 2016 by legislators at the state capitol building a few blocks from Hogen's store that requires out-of-state online retailers to collect state sales taxes. The state enacted the law knowing it would be challenged, due to a 1992 Supreme Court ruling in the case of Quill Corp v. North Dakota, which held that states cannot require retailers to collect sales taxes unless they have a “physical presence” in the state. Passing a law certain to draw fire was ""the nuclear option,"" said Republican state Senator Deb Peters, a prominent supporter of the measure, but legislators considered it necessary as internet sales continue to rise. After the law was enacted, the state preemptively sued four online retailers.  Overstock.com Inc, Wayfair Inc and Newegg Inc contested the lawsuits, while the fourth company, Systemax Inc, decided not to. After losing in lower courts, South Dakota appealed to the Supreme Court, which announced in January it would hear the case. The state will argue that the legal precedent dates back to the days of catalog sales and is no longer relevant in the internet age. A ruling in favor of South Dakota could funnel up to $13 billion a year of new tax revenues into the coffers of affected U.S. state governments, according to a 2017 federal government report. It would also make it harder for consumers to find deals online where they can avoid paying sales tax. Advertisement Hogen is following the Supreme Court action, but while a favorable ruling for the state might help him, he said, he knows a single court ruling cannot reverse the e-commerce trend. ""If this sales tax thing goes through, it’s not going to end internet shopping,"" he said. ""That’s here to stay."" ""PHYSICAL PRESENCE"" The rugged, rural, Republican-led state of South Dakota is notoriously stingy when it comes to spending taxpayer dollars. It has no income tax and relies heavily on sales taxes for revenue. The state estimates it loses up to $50 million a year in sales tax on internet purchases, which now account for 8.4 percent of sales nationwide, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. The new law requires out-of-state online retailers to collect sales tax if they clear $100,000 in sales to South Dakota residents or have 200 separate transactions with customers in the state.  . Wayfair, Overstock and Newegg did not respond to requests seeking comment. Amazon.com Inc, the dominant internet sales company, has not taken a position in the legal battle and declined to comment for this story. Amazon has already agreed to collect sales taxes in all 45 states that impose them. The company has not generally collected taxes for items sold on its website by third party vendors, which constitute about half of total sales on the platform, although two states have now enacted laws to require it to do so. The South Dakota law does not directly affect some other large online retailers, such as Walmart Inc. and Macy's Inc., because they have brick-and-mortar stores in the state and so were already required to collect sales tax. Other states have also wrestled with how to collect out-of-state taxes from e-tailers, including New York, which passed a law in 2008 that sought to stretch the definition of “physical presence” without running afoul of the Supreme Court precedent. Advertisement The amount of money states stand to gain from taxing online sales is uncertain. A widely-cited 2009 study by the University of Tennessee, updated in 2012, estimated that $23 billion a year in state and local revenue was being lost nationwide to internet commerce in 2009 and would increase every year. But data from states that have tried to capture online sales tax revenue suggest that number may be high. In New York, for example, the state has said in court papers that between the 2008 passage of its law and February 2012, e-tailers remitted $360 million in sales tax. The University of Tennessee study had estimated that, by 2012, New York could collect nearly twice that amount in a single year by applying state and local sales taxes to internet purchases. In fiscal 2017, South Dakota took in just over $1.4 billion in sales taxes, according to the state's Department of Revenue, which accounted for 71.7 percent of the state’s total revenue. Only Washington state and Tennessee have a higher proportion of sales tax to total tax revenue, according to the Tax Foundation. Despite South Dakota's predictions of major gains, Governor Dennis Daugaard acknowledged in an interview that ""it's really quite difficult to know"" exactly how much additional revenue the state will gain if it wins at the Supreme Court. KENNEDY'S ROLE The impetus for South Dakota's law came from one of the nine people who now hold its fate in their hands: U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. In a 2015 opinion on a related issue, Kennedy questioned the continuing relevance in the internet age of the 1992 Quill ruling that only sellers with a physical presence in a state could be required to collect sales taxes.  He urged those with a stake in the issue to “find an appropriate case for this Court” to reconsider the earlier precedent. A ruling in the case is due by the end of June. Advertisement Carl Szabo, general counsel of NetChoice, an e-commerce trade association urged the court to defer to Congress on the issue, stressing the complexities of allowing states to collect taxes nationwide. ""One of the fears I have is that there’s nothing to limit small businesses from being inundated by demand letters from tax collectors around the country,"" he said.

 LONDON — Toys “R” Us said on Wednesday that it would close all of its stores in Britain after failing to find a buyer, another ominous sign for a once-dominant toy retailer that has struggled under pressure from Amazon and other online sellers. The company, which filed for bankruptcy in the United States last year, said it would close its remaining 75 stores in Britain in addition to the 25 it has already shut. Toys “R” Us has also closed more than 100 stores in the United States in hopes of avoiding liquidation. The company is owned by the private equity firms Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the real estate firm Vornado Realty Trust. The British arm of the toy seller went into administration, which is similar to a bankruptcy, in February. It had set a deadline of Wednesday to find a buyer for its remaining stores. Advertisement “We have made every effort to secure a buyer for all or part of the company’s business,” Simon Thomas, the joint administrator for the British arm, said in a news release. “This process attracted some interest, but ultimately no party has been able to move forward with a formal bid prior to the expiration of the stated deadline.”  . The administrator said the company’s remaining 75 Toys “R” Us and Babies “R” Us stores would stay open to sell off existing stock, and that the process of closing them would take about six weeks. Advertisement About 67 people lost their jobs at the British arm’s headquarters on Wednesday, the administrator said. The company has about 2,500 employees in Britain. The British arm of Toys “R” Us is the latest retailer to be forced to close or go into administration as changing consumer habits have pushed more purchases online. Maplin, a seller of consumer electronics, collapsed into administration in February. BHS, a large department store fixture throughout Britain, went into administration and closed its stores in 2016.

 Toys “R” Us, the iconic retail chain that has sold toys and games to millions of children for generations, is closing shop in the United States. After filing for bankruptcy protection in September and suffering through a brutal holiday shopping season, the company decided on Wednesday to close or sell all of its remaining stores, after executives met with creditors throughout the day, according to three people briefed on the discussions. More than 30,000 American jobs are at risk as the company winds down. It is a colossal failure for a company that started out in 1948 as a small store in Washington selling cribs, strollers and other baby items. The business eventually grew to more than 2,000 stores, with a wide inventory that made it a destination for children and with an advertising jingle — “I don’t want to grow up, I’m a Toys ‘R’ Us kid” — that was embedded in the American consumer consciousness. The company’s headquarters in Wayne, N.J., are on Geoffrey Way, named after its once-ubiquitous giraffe mascot. Advertisement But in the age of internet retailing, Toys “R” Us has struggled with an antiquated sales model that could not keep up with Amazon and Walmart, and was burdened by $5 billion in debt from a leveraged buyout in 2005. Advertisement “They were at the intersection of so many challenging trends, and they were at the wrong end of those trends,” said Michael Dart, a retail expert and a partner at the consulting firm A. T. Kearney. “All of these forces coming together fundamentally tipped them over the edge.” Liquidation sales will take place over the next few months, as the company clears the shelves at its roughly 880 Toys “R” Us and Babies “R” Us stores around the country. The company signaled that it was nearing the end when it said Wednesday morning that it would shut all of its stores in Britain. In the afternoon, executives informed corporate staff in Wayne about the decision to close the United States stores. The global toy industry has been fighting a losing battle for the attention of children obsessed with smartphones and tablets. Global toy sales have been growing slightly each year, but at a slower pace than that of electronics and video games. In addition, online toy sales have increased by more than 55 percent in the past two years to $17 billion in the United States, while e-commerce revenue for toys has exceeded brick-and-mortar performance in parts of Europe, according to Clavis Insight, an e-commerce research firm. After filing for Chapter 11 protection, Toys “R” Us had planned to shed some of its debt load and refresh its operations. But after a languid holiday sales season, the company’s lenders grew worried about whether Toys “R” Us executives were taking steps drastic enough to restructure the business to allow it to compete over the long term, according to the people briefed on the matter. Advertisement In recent weeks, the creditors had begun to lose patience with the management and its turnaround efforts, these people said. In January, the company said it was closing 182 unprofitable stores in the United States and had already started liquidating those locations.  . But a total liquidation of its United States operations, the creditors calculated, may allow them to recover more money than keeping the stores open. The company was bought in 2005 by the private equity firms Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the real estate firm Vornado Realty Trust. Weighed down by the debt that its owners heaped on the company when they bought it, Toys “R” Us has not adequately invested in its fading stores and e-commerce operations. Unable to compete with other retailers, it has lost market share to better capitalized toy sellers. Toys “R” Us controlled 13.6 percent of the toy market in the United States in 2016, according to research from IBISWorld. Walmart held 29.4 percent, Amazon 16.3 percent and GameStop 13.9 percent. For many analysts, Toys “R” Us was a textbook example of disruption by internet retailers — a giant that once appeared invincible, but whose advantage disappeared as consumers went online for wider selections, lower prices and the ease of buying with a click. Even before the news on Wednesday, the company’s financial collapse had taken a toll on workers like Dyann Rosales, who got a seasonal job at the Toys “R” Us in Pittsburg, Calif., before Christmas and then was hired full time. “This was the chance for me to get out of the hole I had been in,” said Ms. Rosales, 48, who has an 8-year-old daughter. “This was going to be my steppingstone.” Advertisement But she was informed by letter in early February that her store was one of the 182 that would be closing for good. The company had originally said it planned to pay severance to many laid-off employees, Ms. Rosales said. But then she was told that was not likely to happen. “I am back in that pit,” she said. OUR, a labor group focused on retail workers across the country, had been trying to help Toys “R” Us workers receive severance pay and find new jobs. Ms. Rosales said customers had also been saddened by the store’s closing. She recalled an 8-year-old boy who came into the store on his birthday. As a tradition, a store manager announces over the loudspeaker when a birthday boy or girl is in the store and plays a special birthday song. “When the mother heard that, she looked at me and said, ‘This is what we are going to miss,’” Ms. Rosales said. Ben Sisario and Tiffany Hsu contributed reporting.

The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday charged Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, with fraud for raising money from investors on the back of false claims about the company’s blood-testing technology. One of Theranos’s main products, called a miniLab, could not perform all the tests the company said it could, the commission asserted. That, according to the complaint, didn’t stop Theranos from claiming that it had a bright future ahead. Advertisement Here are some of the things the commission says Theranos, a private company, did to pull the wool over investors’ eyes. Advertisement It allegedly performed tests on non-Theranos equipment without telling representatives of a pharmacy company that was poised to invest money in the company. Based on Holmes’ presentation, Pharmacy A executives understood that the blood from their demonstration samples would be tested on Theranos’ miniLabs. Holmes never told the executives that Theranos was actually testing some of their blood on modified third party analyzers. Theranos allegedly distributed fake reports by pharmaceutical companies. Investors believed that pharmaceutical companies had written their own endorsements of Theranos’ technology, when the pharmaceutical companies had not. Theranos allegedly made misleading statements about its work with the United States Department of Defense. While Theranos’ technology was used in a D.O.D. burn study, it was never deployed by the D.O.D. in the battlefield, in Afghanistan, or on medevac helicopters. From 2011 to 2014, Holmes had discussions with multiple divisions of the D.O.D. However, Theranos generated only approximately $300,000 from three D.O.D. contracts. Ms. Holmes allegedly told an investor Theranos expected to expand quickly in the stores of a pharmacy chain, but the likelihood of such an expansion was small. Holmes was aware that Theranos’ retail roll out with Pharmacy A was stalled due to, among other issues, some concerns Pharmacy A executives had with regard to Theranos’ performance. The Food and Drug Administration communicated to Theranos that its approval would be needed, but Ms. Holmes allegedly told investors afterward that F.D.A. approval was merely voluntary. Holmes’ statements that Theranos did not need F.D.A. approval or clearance were important to investors because approval or clearance would have been an obstacle in the company’s path to realizing full commercialization. Ms. Holmes allegedly gave investors fake financial results. Holmes also provided historical financial information to one potential investor. In August 2015, Holmes met with a potential investor, during which she provided Theranos’ financial results for fiscal year 2014. These financials showed 2014 net revenues of $108 million, and 2015 and 2016 net revenue projections of $240 million and $750 million, respectively. But Theranos’ actual financial performance bore no resemblance to the financial information Holmes shared with investors. Theranos recorded little more than $100,000 in revenue in 2014 and was nowhere near generating $100 million in revenue by the end of 2014 — Peter Eavis There is an old adage that if it sounds too good to be true, it isn’t. The case filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes describes a litany of falsehoods about a claimed revolutionary method to conduct blood tests that turned out to be pure fiction. Ms. Holmes and the company settled the case, although the former president, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, is fighting the charges. She will pay a $500,000 penalty, return her shares in Theranos, and agreed to a ban on serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years. What makes this case interesting is that Theranos was one of the original unicorns, a private company with a value of more than $1 billion. We usually see the S.E.C. pursue charges against public companies and their executives, while private firms operate largely free from scrutiny – at least until they prepare for an I.P.O. Advertisement The antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, however, apply to any transaction in a security in which there is a misstatement of material fact. Thus, when Theranos raised millions of dollars by selling shares to hedge funds and venture capitalists, the false claims about the viability of its blood-testing labs ended up being a scheme to defraud. For Ms. Holmes, the settlement means that she will be cut off from raising money for any new venture for a long time. The complaint shows a systemic effort to deceive investors over a number of years, no doubt in a desperate hope that somehow the technology could be made to work. It is unlikely anyone in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street will trust her again. — Peter J. Henning Mr. Kudlow, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, said that Mr. Trump offered him the job as director of the National Economic Council and that he immediately accepted. Mr. Kudlow told The Journal that an announcement could come as early as Thursday. Reaction Mark Hamrick, Bankrate.com’s senior economic analyst: “It remains to be seen whether Kudlow can step into the role of a virtual moderating influence in this administration. Unlike others in this White House, he does have experience in government and the private sector. But unlike television where on-air conflict is sometimes mostly for show, the health of the national and global economy is at stake here.” Ten year’s ago almost to the day, JPMorgan Chase acquired Bear Stearns, a troubled investment bank, for what looked like a steal. But Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s C.E.O., has since said he wouldn’t do a deal like it again, citing the high legal costs that came later. But was buying Bear Stearns as bad a deal as Mr. Dimon suggests? While we don’t have all the numbers necessary for a full accounting, there is much in the public domain that can help answer this question. And this information suggests that, while the Bear Stearns acquisition probably wasn’t as profitable as expected in March 2008, JPMorgan may still have benefited from it — even after taking into account the legal expenses. What caused the legal costs and how big were they? The payouts were made mostly to settle allegations that Wall Street firms had stuffed loans into mortgage-backed bonds that did not meet agreed upon standards. How big were those costs? In his 2015 letter to shareholders, Mr. Dimon said that some 70 percent of JPMorgan’s nearly $19 billion in mortgage-related legal costs were related to Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, the thrift JPMorgan also bought during the crisis. For the sake of argument, let’s assume that 35 percent of that $19 billion stemmed from Bear Stearns’ mortgages. The cost to JPMorgan then would be around $6.7 billion. That’s a lot, but when JPMorgan did the deal, it agreed to terms that gave it a lot of financial protection against nasty surprises like this. JPMorgan paid $1.5 billion for Bear Stearns, far below the $11.8 billion of shareholders’ equity that Bear Stearns reported on its balance sheet at the end of 2007. This wide margin for error would have helped the bank absorb the $6 billion of merger-related costs that executives anticipated in March 2008. Advertisement True, JPMorgan almost certainly ended up marking down Bear Stearns’ riskier assets by more than expected in the months after the deal, when market conditions got even worse. But many of these assets could have recovered in the next few years as the financial system stabilized. After 2008, “principal transactions” at JPMorgan’s investment bank, the business line that included the performance of many of Bear Stearns’ assets, produced over $8 billion of annual revenue, far more than the $4.4 billion that JPMorgan on its own generated in 2007. Let’s also not forget that the Federal Reserve took a large slug of the risk in the deal. The Fed made an extraordinary loan to a special entity that bought some $30 billion of Bear Stearns’ assets. According to Kate Kelly’s book on Bear Stearns’ final days, JPMorgan was reluctant to buy Bear Stearns without assistance from the Fed. JPMorgan did provide a $1.2 billion loan to the Fed’s entity, in theory exposing it to some losses on the assets. But in the end, that loan generated a $665 million gain for JPMorgan in 2012. The Bear Stearns deal also came with some straightforward positives. JPMorgan, for instance, got Bear Stearns’ leading prime brokerage unit, a business that provided brokerage services to hedge funds. That and other Bear Stearns operations were expected to add at least $1 billion a year to JPMorgan earnings, the bank’s executives said at the time. And, of course, JPMorgan scooped up Bear Stearns’ trophy tower in Midtown Manhattan. At the time of the deal, the building, at 383 Madison Ave., had an estimated value of $1.2 billion. According to the estimates of developers in the New York real estate market, the building is now worth at least $1.8 billion. -- Peter Eavis with reporting from Charles V. Bagli. Jun Ying, the former chief information officer of Equifax’s core United States consumer reporting division, was charged on Wednesday with insider trading for selling nearly $1 million in company stock after he learned about a major data breach in 2017 but before it was publicly announced. Cybertrails The commission’s complaint against Mr. Ying describes a step he took to estimate what he might lose on his Equifax stock. He took to the internet to find out what had happened to the shares of Experian, a rival credit bureau, after it revealed that hackers had breached its system. At approximately 10:00 a.m. on Monday, August 28, 2017, Ying used a search engine to find information on the internet concerning the September 2015 cybersecurity breach of Experian, another one of the three major credit bureaus, and the impact that breach had on Experian’s stock price. The search terms used by Ying were: (1) “Experian breach”; (2) “Experian stock price 9/15/2015”; and (3) “Experian breach 2015.” — Peter Eavis When he killed Broadcom’s pursuit of Qualcomm, President Trump put his administration in uncharted territory. The White House has made no secret of its concerns about Beijing, and seems to have been motivated by the prospect of Qualcomm losing its lead in 5G. Some now worry that this could be another front in a potential global trade war. Here’s Jason Furman, a senior economic adviser in the Obama White House, talking to the NYT: “If every country in the world conducted policy like that, it would make cross-border investment difficult to the detriment of American and foreign companies,” Mr. Furman said. “Foreign direct investment is an important part of the strength of the U.S. economy.” Of note: Qualcomm spent far more than Broadcom on lobbying. Broadcom officially withdrew its bid this morning. Advertisement What’s next for Qualcomm: The chip maker’s Hail Mary — petitioning the government for a national-security review of Broadcom’s bid — paid off handsomely. But now it has to show investors that it can fix its business. Peter Eavis’s take: National champions have to deliver. Will Qualcomm become less efficient under the government’s protection? If so, U.S. tax payers may feel taken advantage of. Elsewhere in semiconductors: The industry largely ignored a short seller’s report on purported security flaws in AMD chips. (Axios) President Trump announced his metals tariffs to protect American makers of aluminum and steel. But that could put Boeing in the firing line — America’s top exporter, which employs nearly as many people as the U.S. steel and aluminum industries combined. More from Natalie Kitroeff of the NYT: “I’m really worried about what it’s going to do to us,” said James Springer, a mechanic who installs stow bins and class dividers on 787 Dreamliners at Boeing’s plant in North Charleston, S.C. “What will the E.U. and China do, especially China? They are one of our biggest customers now.” And Mr. Trump’s attacks on Chinese metal production are in some ways a relic of past trade battles, as Beijing moves away from basic commodities. Elsewhere in trade: Marco Rubio argues in an NYT Op-Ed that the U.S. should take measures more targeted than the tariffs to punish China for unfair trade practices.

 Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • How foreign is Broadcom? • The markets are worried that free trade has no voice at the White House. • The E.U. formally announced its plan for any Trump tariffs. • Chuck Rosenberg, a former senior official at the Justice Department, is going to Crowell & Moring. Want this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here. As the Trump administration weighs whether to block the chip maker’s $117 billion takeover bid for Qualcomm, a central issue is how much of a threat the deal is to national security. In an effort to assuage concerns, Broadcom pledged Wednesday to increase research spending on 5G wireless tech and to create a $1.5 billion fund to invest in training engineering talent in the United States to help allay those concerns. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, has jurisdiction over the transaction because Broadcom is currently incorporated in Singapore, where the company has been legally headquartered since 2005. But the company is preparing to move its corporate base to the United States, in part to avoid being considered a foreign acquirer. Advertisement Beyond Broadcom’s legal domicile, though, is it a substantially foreign company? Let’s take a look at a number of factors. Advertisement Sales First, a caveat: Both Broadcom and Qualcomm categorize where their revenue based on the location to which the chips that go in the smartphones and other devices are delivered. As Qualcomm puts it:  “China revenues could include revenues related to shipments of integrated circuits to a company that is headquartered in South Korea but that manufactures devices in China, which devices are then sold to consumers in Europe and/or the United States.” According to Broadcom’s most recent annual report, roughly 7 percent of its $17.6 billion in net revenue comes from the United States. The single biggest market for the company is China, which accounted for roughly 54 percent of its net revenue. “Other” markets made up nearly 38 percent. As a point of comparison, 2 percent of Qualcomm’s revenues come from the United States. Some 65 percent of its revenue comes from China, including Hong Kong, according to its most recent annual report. Employees Roughly 55 percent of Broadcom’s employees are based in North America, according to the annual report. About 38 percent are in Asia, and the remainder work in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. About 52 percent of Qualcomm’s employees are based in the United States. Broadcom also said that about 62 percent of the square footage of its properties, both owned and leased, are in the United States. By contrast, Qualcomm has roughly 56 percent of its owned and leased facilities in the United States. Corporate governance The vast majority of Broadcom’s board are American citizens who live in the United States. That includes Jim Diller, its chairman; Henry Samueli, the founder of the original Broadcom; and Ken Hao, the Silver Lake partner who has backed Broadcom for years. Hock Tan, the company’s C.E.O., immigrated to the United States to attend M.I.T. and then Harvard Business School and lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1990. Broadcom does have one Singaporean director, Check Low, to comply with Singapore’s corporate rules. Advertisement Ownership The two companies share 11 of their top 20 shareholders, including big index fund managers like BlackRock and Vanguard. — Michael de la Merced President Trump’s top economic adviser finally announced he would leave, in a sign that the nationalists have won the White House debate on tariffs. The news prompted Tom Nides, Morgan Stanley’s vice chairman, to utter aloud, “Oh, that’s a problem.” More on Mr. Cohn’s decision from Kate Kelly and Maggie Haberman of the NYT, who broke the news yesterday: It leaves Mr. Trump surrounded primarily by advisers with strong protectionist views who advocate the types of aggressive trade measures, like tariffs, that Mr. Trump campaigned on but that Mr. Cohn fought inside the White House. Mr. Cohn was viewed by Republican lawmakers as the steady hand who could prevent Mr. Trump from engaging in activities that could trigger a trade war. Potential replacements, according to Axios: Peter Navarro, the trade adviser who pushed for the tariffs; Kevin Warsh, the former Fed governor; Shahira Knight, a deputy of Mr. Cohn’s; and the pro-free-trade economist Larry Kudlow. But Axios says that there’s no official succession plan, and that other members of the National Economic Council will likely leave (We can rule out Austan Goolsbee.) The timing: CNBC notes that Mr. Cohn’s announcement came hours after Mr. Trump said that “everyone wants to work in the White House.” It also came after Mr. Trump tweeted, “There is no Chaos, only great Energy!” Peter Eavis’s take: Even if there is no plunge, now is a moment for investors to make up their minds about populism. Critics’ corner: The WSJ editorial board said Mr. Cohn’s departure was “a significant blow” to Mr. Trump’s presidency. The NYT editorial board said Mr. Cohn had done “an awful job,” which still probably represented “the high-water mark for economic thinking” for this White House. And his former boss, Lloyd Blankfein, said he had served his country “in a first class way.” The Federal Reserve has helped support the economy when a big event – fears for the survival of the euro, fiscal standoffs in Congress, oil price declines — threatens to dampen growth. But will the Fed have the same leeway to stimulate the economy if rising trade tensions start to weigh on the growth prospects of the United States? Advertisement Maybe not. The Fed had ample room to keep its policy loose when inflation was dormant for years after the financial crisis. But now that inflation seems to be waking up, the Fed might not have the same flexibility. Indeed, amid the current trade tumult, investors still seem to believe that inflation is moving higher. This can be seen in a closely watched bond market indicator flagged this morning by Lisa Abramowicz of Bloomberg. 
            As fears of a trade war heat up, U.S. inflation expectations over the next five years have risen to the highest since 2013, as per 5-year forward breakeven contracts. pic.twitter.com/ZgXyYqxh6c  One outcome: The concerns about a trade war may end up weighing on growth and causing the inflationary pressures to abate. That would give the Fed more room to maneuver, perhaps allowing it to raise interest rates more slowly. But it could get messy. Trade tariffs, applied broadly, could push up the prices of many goods at a time when the Fed has to grapple with the enormous fiscal stimulus that Congress just enacted. - Peter Eavis Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard became the latest policymaker to express confidence that inflation would hit the Fed’s target of 2 percent this year. “Mounting tailwinds at a time of full employment and above-trend growth tip the balance of considerations in my view. With greater confidence in achieving the inflation target, continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate.” What are those tailwinds? “The most notable tailwind is the shift in America’s fiscal policy stance from restraint to substantial stimulus in an economy close to full employment.” Ms. Brainard’s comments are notable because she had previously argued vocally for caution in tightening monetary policy. Major stocks indexes in the United States are down a bit. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 are both off just over 0.5 percent. Futures fell more than 1 percent in the hours after the news broke. Despite the muted response, a number of analysts are warning that investors need to prepare for the possibility that more protectionist/populist policies are on the way. Here’s a look at some reactions: Joe Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM US, wrote:  “The resignation of Gary Cohen from his position at the White House will likely have no to little impact on policymaking out of the West Wing or the bureaucracy. His likely replacement be it Peter Navarro or Larry Kudlow will still be subject to the whims of the occupant of the oval office and a prisoner of the internal inconsistencies of the Trump economic agenda: that it could debt finance a $1.5 trillion dollar tax cut (with a $750 billion fudge factor) and then throw an additional $320 billion in kerosene on top of the debt fueled flames without stoking rising inflation and higher interest rates that are almost certain to follow in its wake. No economic advisor, whatever their academic or professional background will be able to liberate the economy from such internal inconsistencies given the whim like policy making apparatus that exists inside a chaotic White House.” Brian Gardner and Michael Michaud, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote:  “Regardless of whether Mr. Cohn’s replacement comes from the mainstream or is an economic nationalist, investors need to realize that President Trump’s populist rhetoric on trade is real and that protectionist trade policies are more likely than not. To date, investors have been assuaged that Mr. Cohn was the “adult in the room” in an unorthodox and chaotic White House and for most economic and regulatory policy that was the case. However, we think trade policy is different and investors need to understand that the assumptions about a liberal and open global trade framework are being shredded and that the sanctions on steel and aluminum may represent a new paradigm regarding global trade.” What does that mean? The analysts said they think the United States is more likely than not to withdraw from Nafta. Charlie McElligott at Nomura Securities wrote:  “It still feels that collective investor mentality views this as little-more than a political ploy to galvanize Trump’s core constituency into mid-term elections, a game-theory standoff to draw-out trade concessions from China.” But he adds: “It does “pull forward” risk of the “Bad Trump” scenario which that market had largely “priced-out” into the “now.” Between Feb. 12 and Feb. 22, the billionaire investor sold about $31 million of the crane maker's stock. Advertisement To some, that seemed like good timing. Since the day before he started selling, the stock is down 20 percent. The catalyst? The Trump administration’s plans to slap tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Manitowoc stock fell 4.8 percent on Feb. 16 when Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross unveiled a report calling for tariffs on imported steel. The company’s shares then dropped 6 percent Thursday when President Trump announced his plan. On Wednesday, Mr. Icahn said he had no knowledge of the Trump administration’s plans when he moved to reduce his holding. In a statement on his website, Mr. Icahn said: “We don’t generally comment on rumors, but the recent media speculation regarding our sale of Manitowoc stock calls for a response. We state for the record: Any suggestion that we had prior knowledge of the Trump administration’s announcement of new tariffs on steel imports is categorically untrue. We reduced our position in Manitowoc for legitimate investment reasons having nothing to do with that announcement.” The political bloc formally announced its plan to counterattack, including taxing American goods like Harley-Davidsons and bourbon and filing a challenge with the World Trade Organization. Meanwhile, allies continued to fret. South Korea worries that tariffs will complicate its efforts to denuclearize the North. Christine Lagarde of the I.M.F. warned of the perils of a trade war. And fellow Republicans in Washington continued to lobby the White House. The aluminum industry doesn’t want tariffs either In a letter to the White House yesterday, the Aluminum Association (which represents both U.S. and foreign suppliers) said that the move would be a bad idea. Complaints can be heard around the sector. The C.E.O. of Novelis, a big aluminum producer, criticized Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for saying predictions of price increases were “hysteria.” And DowDuPont said it might now build plants in Canada or Argentina rather than the U.S. Bayer said it is in exclusive talks with BASF about the sale of its entire vegetable seeds business as the German chemicals multinational, seeks to win approval for its $56 billion deal for Monsanto from European regulators. European antitrust regulators opened an in-depth investigation into Bayer’s planned acquisition of Monsanto, its American agribusiness rival, in August. European competition authorities are expected to wrap up their inquiry by early next month. The proposed combination is the latest in a series of mergers in the rapidly consolidating seed and agrochemical sector. Advertisement Bayer previously agreed to sell selected businesses with its Crop Sciences unit to BASF for 5.9 billion euros, or about $7.3 billion at current exchange rates, in October. Both deals, if one were to be reached on the vegetable seeds business, would be subject to the Monsanto transaction closing. — Chad Bray Mr. Rosenberg had a long career in government: twice U.S. attorney, he’s been a longtime senior official at the Justice Department (including as chief of staff to James Comey) and acting head of the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Advertisement More from Cecilia Kang and Alan Rappeport of the NYT: “It is the new paradigm,” said Paul Triolo, head of global technology policy at Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consulting company. “That implies technologies with 5G, artificial intelligence, biotech and automation are now considered more sensitive and part of a national innovation base that needs to be protected.” As Michael points out, however, much of Cfius’s letter to the two companies focused on how Broadcom could manage Qualcomm if it took over. Its “private equity” cost-cutting could lead to Qualcomm reducing investment in R. & D. and ceding its 5G lead to Huawei of China, according to the letter. Broadcom said this morning that it was committed to advancing 5G and that it is an American company in everything but legal headquarters.

 FRANKFURT/BERLIN —  German software giant SAP on Tuesday said operating margins hit bottom last year and will begin to arc up this year and rise further through 2020 and beyond, as profitability improves in its internet-based cloud business. Speaking to investors in New York, SAP executives also detailed moves to make it easier for customers to run SAP business planning tools via low-cost Amazon, Google or Microsoft cloud servers or in SAP's own datacenters, allowing it to pare back its capital spending. Chief Financial Officer Luka Mucic told the company's annual capital markets day event that easing up on heavy investments to switch customers to cloud-based software would help margins rise to 29.8 percent in 2018 and reach around 30.7 percent by 2020, with further improvements into the next decade. SAP had reported margins troughing at 28.9 percent in 2017. Board member and products chief Bernd Leukert said the company would let customers interchangeably run their software on SAP datacenters or on public cloud services. The executives' comments were monitored by Reuters via webcast. Advertisement SAP plans to shut down 18 of its 45 datacenters by the end of 2019, as more customers switch to public cloud services, a faster pace than the 10 datacenters it closed in the last two to three years. Advertisement Leukert also said that consolidating a string of cloud software acquisitions running on separate platforms, each separately maintained, onto a single, common platform would be completed by the end of 2018, further shaving costs.  . He said SAP had elected to harmonise its own company-run datacenters by standardising Google as its preferred ""go-to"" infrastructure. ""There is no difference any more running in Google or on SAP infrastructure,"" he said. Nonetheless, Leukert said SAP was working with all major public cloud providers and had no plans to compete with them. ""Our cloud solutions run on the major public cloud providers,"" he said. ""We want to be friends with the best: the Googles, the Amazons, the (Microsoft) Azures"".

T1,6-Mar-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin MARCH 6, 2018
 Good Tuesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Gary Cohn is exiting the White House. • Why Cfius thinks Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm is a national security matter • A top aluminum lobbying group argues against tariffs • Should mutual funds become activists on guns? • Could the Trump tariffs be weakened? Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Will the gains investors have made under President Trump now walk out the door, too? Mr. Cohn was an influential figure in the White House. As the president’s top economic adviser, he opposed policies, like the tariffs announced last week, that go against the prevailing global economic order. Now that Mr. Cohn is leaving, investors may fear that Mr. Trump and others in his administration will step up their assault on globalism, stoking the chances of a trade war and other tensions that damage the real economy. Advertisement Mr. Cohn has telegraphed his unhappiness with some of President Trump’s policies, so his departure may not come as a surprise to investors. They also may believe that the chaos in the White House will limit the administration’s ability to deliver on policies investors don’t like. And of course, investors may hope that Mr. Trump, unwilling to see the stock market’s gains unwind, stays his hand. It’s even possible that Mr. Trump will keep talking to Mr. Cohn after he leaves, or that he will replace Mr. Cohn with someone with similar views, like Larry Kudlow. Advertisement Still, the Dow Jones industrial average may open sharply down on Wednesday morning. The markets were rattled in August when there were rumors that Mr. Cohn might resign. And futures markets on Tuesday evening pointed to a lower open. But even if there is no plunge, now is a moment for investors to make up their minds about populism. For two years, the markets have consistently shrugged off everything from Britain’s departure from the European Union to the election of Mr. Trump to the rise of non-mainstream parties in Europe. Investors could look the other way because global growth was picking up, and Mr. Trump was introducing pro-business policies like tax cuts and deregulation. But investors and populists are entwined in a way that is not obvious. Right now, economies are suffering from what could be called “Toxic Goldilocks Syndrome.” The stimulus of central banks has delivered moderate economic growth and steady returns for investors that keep them happy. At the same time, though, the central bank’s policies have struggled to solve deeper problems like income inequality and low labor market participation. As these persist, they provide fuel for populist candidates. What could change now? With Mr. Cohn leaving, one of Mr. Trump’s policies may end up causing real economic damage. That’s a concern of investors, at least. But then much depends on how the Federal Reserve responds. If, say, Mr. Trump’s tariffs dampened growth this year, the Fed might choose to raise interest rates once, rather than three times, in effect helping investors and the White House. But there is a much brighter scenario. Despite the deeper economic problems and the tumult over trade, growth picks up to a level that causes a real bump in wages this year, and Mr. Trump decides to bask in that success, rather than aiming a wrecking ball at the international economic order. But who’s around now to make that argument? — Peter Eavis Cfius said that Broadcom’s proposed deal to acquire rival chip maker Qualcomm could pose a national security risk and called for a full investigation into the hostile bid, according to a letter from a United States Treasury official. During the time between Qualcomm’s unilateral filing and Treasury’s agency filing, Cfius has been communicating with both parties to obtain additional information to inform its decision on the appropriate path forward in regards to this matter. It was during this time, and as a result of these communications and additional information, that Cfius has come to believe that Broadcom’s successful hostile takeover attempt of Qualcomm, including the related stock purchase, proxy contest for the election of six directors to Qualcomm’s Board as proposed and selected by Broadcom, Proposed Agreement and Plan of Merger, and any potential merger between Broadcom and Qualcomm, could pose a risk to the national security of the United States. The letter goes on to say: Cfius has identified potential national security concerns that warrant a full investigation of the proposed transaction. Articulation of the potential national security concerns, in significant part, is classified. The move complicates an already contentious deal, increasing the likelihood that Broadcom will end its pursuit of Qualcomm. Such investigations are often death knells for corporate deals. Advertisement Cfius said that the potential risk was related to Broadcom’s relationships with foreign entities. A spokesman for Broadcom told DealBook in a statement, “we are fully cooperating with Cfius.” Michael’s take Though Cfius stressed the importance of protecting national security, relatively little of the letter focused on explaining traditional matters of national security. Though the document mentioned Broadcom’s “relationships with third party foreign entities,” it does not go into detail about those ties. The letter does note that descriptions of national security concerns are largely classified. But it makes no mention of Qualcomm’s publicly disclosed partnerships with Huawei, the Chinese rival long considered closely tied to Beijing, on the 5G standard, either. What Cfius appears capable of describing publicly is concern about how Broadcom might manage Qualcomm after a successful takeover. The government panel describes Broadcom’s potential approach as akin to “private equity,” referring to the company’s well-known penchant for cutting costs to help drive profits. To the government, that could pose dangers for Qualcomm’s edge in advancing 5G technology. The chip maker is considered, along with Huawei, to be one of the two leading developers of the superfast wireless standard, and any potential disruption to its business could mean ceding an important advantage to the Chinese, Cfius writes. “While the United States remains dominant in the standards-setting space currently, China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover. Given well-known U.S. national security concerns about Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies, a shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States.” Cfius’s letter also notes that Qualcomm supplies the United States government with important products, and consults on cybersecurity matters relating to 5G and the internet of things. Any disruption of that work, the panel writes, “could have a detrimental impact on national security.” Another take from a friend of DealBook Here are tweets by Steven Davidoff Solomon, long known as our colleague the Deal Professor: 
            Resending as thread: The letter from CFIUS on Broadcm and Qualcomm is remarkable and a must read. One of the security risks cited is the operation of Q in a private equity manner, with underinvestment in R&D! Of course, Huawei and China make an appearance: https://t.co/KlkZXMAOdj  
            The ramifications of a broad-based investment approach by CFIUS to approval of deals has wide-spread ramifications. With the tariffs and CFIUS we are entering into a realpolitik of American trade.         
            This realpolitik acknowledges that China uses its antitrust policy to obtain technology from US companies, China and many other countries prohibit U.S. investment in certain industries and the state apparatus benefits domestic companies. The U.S. is merely playing catch-up.         — Michael de la Merced President Trump said that he is thinking of putting tariffs on imported aluminum and steel to protect the domestic metal industries. But in a letter to the White House today, the Aluminum Association said that the move would be a bad idea. From the group’s letter, signed by its C.E.O., Heidi Brock: We fear that the proposed tariff may do more harm than good, hurting rather than helping the 97 percent of aluminum industry jobs in mid-and-downstream production processes. In the letter, the association says that more narrowly targeted tariffs on Chinese production — which would be more akin to what previous administrations have done — and exemptions for trading partners like Canada and the E.U. would be better. Advertisement Worth noting:  The association’s website says that it represents both U.S. and foreign suppliers. — Michael de la Merced Policy flyaround • Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tells lawmakers: “We are not looking to get into trade wars.” (Bloomberg) • Harley-Davidson is bracing for a one-two punch: President Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum and threats of retaliation from Europe.

BlackBerry argues that Facebook and its Whatsapp and Instagram apps copied technology and features from BlackBerry Messenger, Reuters reports. BlackBerry said in a filing with a Los Angeles federal court. “Defendants created mobile messaging applications that co-opt BlackBerry’s innovations, using a number of the innovative security, user interface, and functionality enhancing features.” Facebook Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal told Reuters: “BlackBerry’s suit sadly reflects the current state of its messaging business. Having abandoned its efforts to innovate, Blackberry is now looking to tax the innovation of others.” “BlackBerry is trying to persuade other companies to pay licensing royalties to use its trove of more than 40,000 global patents on technology including operating systems, networking infrastructure, acoustics, messaging, automotive subsystems, cybersecurity and wireless communications,” Reuters reports. Greg Greeley, an executive at Amazon, is joining Airbnb as president of Homes. He will oversee the company’s core business, including its newly launched Airbnb Plus and Airbnb Collections programs. “Words can’t express how excited I am to join the Airbnb team,” Mr. Greeley said. “I’ve used Airbnb for years, and the chance to work here and expand the positive impact its community is having around the world is a once in a lifetime opportunity.” Advertisement Mr. Greeley has spent the past 18 years at Amazon. Most recently, he led Amazon Prime. Before that, he oversaw the launch of businesses in India and Brazil for the e-commerce giant and managed its European consumer businesses. Context Airbnb has been reorganizing and building out its executive ranks. Last month, Belinda Johnson, the home-rental company’s chief business affairs and legal officer, was named the chief operating officer, and Laurence Tosi, Airbnb’s chief financial officer, left the company to focus on his investment fund. Every expert that Michael and our colleagues spoke to yesterday acknowledged that the national security panel’s review of Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm was extraordinary. (One other time Cfius was involved in a contested situation, recalled by Reuters: BHP Billiton’s bid for Rio Tinto in 2008.) Its move shows Washington’s worries about the selling of U.S. companies to foreign counterparts — and its willingness to act. From Alan Rappeport, Cecilia Kang and Chad Bray of the NYT: With the White House making the case for more government intervention, Cfius is expected to gain more authority. A bipartisan group of lawmakers wants to expand the panel’s scope beyond mergers, giving it the power to review joint ventures and investments in start-ups. The deal context: Qualcomm filed for a review of the proxy fight on Jan. 29, before voting on the board contest began. But as of yesterday, Broadcom looked on course to win at least four seats, with a decent chance of six. Big index funds like BlackRock and Vanguard hadn’t voted yet. Bonus explainer: Everything you’d want to know about Cfius. In other foreign deals: The Chicago Stock Exchange’s proposed sale to Chinese investors is dead. Some institutional investors have talked about divesting their shares in gun makers like American Outdoor Brands and Vista Outdoor. (And some, like the Carlyle Group’s David Rubenstein, say they will never invest in the industry.) But, Andrew asks, what if those giants became shareholder activists to change those businesses? From his latest column: BlackRock has enormous influence over both gun makers and retailers. It could pressure them to raise the minimum age for buying AR-15-style rifles to 25 years old, and impose strict screening and background checks that go far beyond what is required by law. BlackRock could even push gun makers to stop producing such weapons altogether. The rub: Any decision has to be anchored by financial logic, since BlackRock and others have fiduciary duties to their own investors. But then gun makers are facing costs from boycotts by both consumers and businesses like REI. Elsewhere in guns: A bipartisan bill would require federal officials to notify state law enforcement within 24 hours if someone fails a national background check. And the dating app Bumble has banned gun-related images from user profiles.

The foreign bank campaign: Peter Eavis dived into how Deutsche Bank and others are trying to take advantage of a bill that would relax regulations for regional banks.

 LONDON/FRANKFURT —  German broadcaster ProSiebenSat 1 Media rejected a critical report on Tuesday by short-seller Viceroy Research, saying the allegations of questionable accounting contained in it were ""unfounded and distorting reality"". ProSieben's shares fell as much as 9 percent after the release of the report, which coincided with news the company was dropping out of Germany's DAX Index of blue-chip stocks. Viceroy, which has targeted companies including South African retailer Steinhoff, alleged in its 37-page report that ProSieben had overpaid for acquisitions and was inflating revenues from non-cash transactions. In particular, it took aim at ProSieben's media-for-equity model, in which it offers free advertising airtime on its channels in exchange for stakes in companies the broadcaster is investing in. Advertisement ""ProSieben has subsidized a fabricated digital 'growth story' using cash flows from its TV advertising business and idle TV advertising inventory,"" the report said. Advertisement ""As its core business declines, ProSieben can no longer counterbalance its underperforming digital segments - the earnings structure is on the brink of collapse."" Viceroy put a valuation of 7.51 euros (6.69 pounds) on ProSieben's shares, a 75 percent discount to Monday's closing price. In a statement, the Munich-based broadcaster dismissed Viceroy's allegations out of hand and said it would respond in more detail in due course ""The allegations of short-seller Viceroy contained in their report are unfounded and distorting reality,"" ProSieben said, reiterating its 2017 results and outlook published on Feb. 22. Viceroy's report into Steinhoff was followed by an admission of ""accounting irregularities"" that triggered an 85-percent slide in its share price. The South African government has, however, called for an investigation into Viceroy after a separate report on Capitec sparked a sell-off in the bank's stock.  . SHORT-SELLER TARGET ProSieben has for months been in the sights of short sellers - speculators who position themselves to profit from share-price falls - as the company was forced to issue a series of outlook downgrades due to weak TV ad revenues. Despite former CEO Thomas Ebeling's drive to diversify into business lines such as e-commerce, weak ad revenues eventually proved to be his undoing and he stepped down as CEO last month after nine years in charge. Advertisement He was replaced by Max Conze, former CEO at British vacuum cleaner maker Dyson. In December, Swedish hedge fund Bodenholm Capital disclosed a short position in ProSieben, saying the company was losing market share, as well as criticising the number of one-off costs the business reported. Other funds that have shorted Prosieben's shares include AQR Capital Management and Old Mutual Global Investors, according to German regulatory filings. Viceroy founder Fraser Perring told Reuters he had a fundamentally bearish take on the media sector, as young viewers flee and digital platforms attract advertisers. His attitude towards ProSieben's media-for-equity model was that ""it smacks of desperation"". ""They are recognising value of equity significantly higher than what it is worth. If they were a private equity firm, what is their strategy, what are their synergies?"" he told Reuters. More broadly, broadcast media faces an onslaught from platform giants like Amazon and Netflix with their video-on-demand offering of original TV content and Hollywood hits attracting millions of viewers. Netflix, whose shares have risen 64 percent so far this year, has added more than the equivalent of ProSieben's entire equity market value in the last two trading days alone. ProSieben's shares were down 5.2 percent at 28.47 euros as of 1330 GMT, valuing the company at about $8 billion.

 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc was sued on Thursday by a former executive who accused the world's largest retailer of issuing misleading e-commerce results, amid growing pressure from Amazon.com Inc, and firing him for complaining about it. Tri Huynh, a former director of business development, accused Walmart of having betrayed the principles of integrity and honesty espoused by founder Sam Walton in its push to show ""meteoric growth"" in e-commerce. The complaint alleges various wrongdoing, including the mislabeling of products, enabling Walmart to charge excessive sales commissions, and failure to properly process customer returns, enabling it to boost results. ""Wal-Mart cut corners and cheated in a race to expand and gain market-share,"" having been ""desperate to gain the ground it had long lost to Amazon,"" Huynh said in his complaint filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. Advertisement Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the litigation is based on allegations by a disgruntled former employee, who was let go when the business was restructured. Advertisement ""We take allegations like this seriously and looked into them when they were brought to our attention,"" he said. ""The investigation found nothing to suggest that the company acted improperly."" Walmart will vigorously defend itself against the claims, Hargrove added. The retailer's shares closed down 16 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $87.51, after earlier falling as much as 2 percent. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has spent billions of dollars in recent years to compete with Amazon, including through its 2016 purchase of Jet.com, and last month said quarterly online sales, including the December holidays, had risen 23 percent. But Amazon's sales in North America grew 40 percent in the same quarter, and analysts have said its price war has weighed on Walmart's margins. Huynh accused Walmart of charging higher sales commissions from sellers on its online marketplace, where third-party sellers list and sell products, with commissions rising as high as 15 percent compared with the normal 6 percent to 8 percent.  . Walmart's internal controls allegedly failed to detect the problem, causing the retailer to overstate revenue. Huynh also said Walmart failed to process more than $7 million of customer returns, inflating the total value of merchandise sold from September 2015 to March 2016. The plaintiff, who was born in Vietnam and lives in Washington state, said Walmart abruptly fired him in January 2017 in retaliation for his repeated complaints about its e-commerce reporting and internal controls. Advertisement Huynh said he was fired not long after raising concerns with U.S. e-commerce chief Marc Lore, and was dismissed under the ""false pretenses"" of a broader workforce reduction and alleged performance issues. He said he had told human resources the prior May of his efforts to deal with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. ""Wal-Mart sacrificed and betrayed its Founder's key principles of integrity and honesty, pushing those core values aside in its rush to win the E-commerce war at all costs,"" Huynh said. ""In doing this, it realized it must silence any whistleblower who spoke up."" The lawsuit, which accuses Walmart of violating the federal Sarbanes-Oxley whistleblower law and various California state laws, seeks punitive and other damages. The case is Huynh v Wal-Mart Stores Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-01631.

 The mood in the courtroom was hopeful when Toys “R” Us filed for bankruptcy last September. The company’s lawyer, in the first hearing, played a clip of the retailer’s famous jingle “I’m a Toys ‘R’ Us Kid” and vowed to restore the company’s place in the hearts of millions of American families. The reality is that Toys “R” Us, which announced on Thursday that it would shutter or sell all of its stores in the United States, never had much chance at a turnaround. For over a decade, Toys “R” Us had been drowning in $5 billion of debt, which its private equity backers had saddled it with. With debt payments siphoning off cash every year, Toys “R” Us could not properly invest in its worn-out suburban stores or outdated website. Sales plummeted, as Amazon captured more children’s desires — and their parents’ wallets — for Star Wars Legos and Paw Patrol recycling trucks. Toys “R” Us is the latest failure of financial engineering, albeit one that could portend a potentially more ominous outlook for private equity in the digital era. Advertisement Most buyouts tend to work the same way. A private equity firm takes over a troubled company with the goal of sprucing up the strategy, cutting costs and overhauling the business over three or five years. But they often load up a company with debt to pay for the deal, which can prove problematic if the profits do not perk up. Advertisement In the age of Amazon, that formula can be dangerous. Consumer demands are changing so quickly that heavily indebted companies have trouble reordering their business to adapt and compete with better-funded rivals. [ READ MORE: “It’s kind of a punch in the gut for us to see how much online shopping has affected things.” Customers across the United States told us what Toys “R” Us meant to them. Here’s what they had to say » ] A wave of buyouts has collapsed in recent weeks, felled by digital competition. Struggling in the streaming music age, iHeartMedia, the large radio company saddled with debt since its 2008 buyout, filed for bankruptcy this week. The regional New York grocery chain Tops filed for bankruptcy last month, citing competition from Amazon and the debt burden that its former private equity backers had heaped on it. Other buyouts are looking shaky. The television company Univision, which recently scrapped plans for a public offering, is shaking up its leadership. The parent company of the Winn-Dixie supermarket chain said this week it was seeking to restructure its debt, as it planned to close stores. Not all troubled private equity deals end with a company winding down, as in the case of Toys “R” Us. Retailers like Gymboree and Payless ShoeSource have found second lives after emerging from bankruptcy, often with investments from new private equity or hedge fund owners willing to give the business another try. But the deterioration of Toys “R” Us from a potential turnaround strategy to the end of an iconic brand — in a matter of months — shows just how difficult it can be for private equity to compete in a rapidly evolving industry. In retailing, Amazon is reordering everything on the store shelf. And children’s changing interest in games and toys, which now encompasses high-end electronics, adds to the complexity. The company said on Thursday that it had no other option than to begin winding down about 730 stores around the United States. Toys “R” Us was still looking at the possibility of keeping 200 stores open and combining them with its Canadian operations. But no deal had been struck yet. Advertisement “This is a profoundly sad day for us,” the Toys “R” Us chief executive, David Brandon, said in a statement, “as well as for the millions of kids and families who we have served for the past 70 years.” The toy business looked a lot simpler in 2005, when the private equity firms Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the real estate firm Vornado Realty Trust acquired the company for $6.6 billion. The investor group figured the toy industry was ripe for consolidation. After the buyout, Toys “R” Us bought the famed toy seller F.A.O. Schwarz as well as the brand and website of KB Toys. The company had become the world’s largest “toy showroom,” its shelves stocked with thousands of different actions figures, video games and other wares from large suppliers like Mattel and Hasbro as well as smaller brands that make stuffed animals and glow-in-the-dark slime. Sales were strong, even after the recession. The company had considered going public, giving its private equity owners a way to cash out. But the company scrapped the offering in 2013, citing unfavorable market conditions.  . Enter Amazon. In recent years, the company had started to aggressively expand its toy business, creating a comprehensive, online showroom with low prices at the click of a button. Pressed by Amazon, Walmart also pushed hard into toys, dropping its prices to capture more market share. Walmart could absorb the price cuts on toys because it makes up the profit on other items. But for Toys “R” Us, a price war on toys and games, its only offerings, was devastating. In 2015, the company hired Mr. Brandon as chief executive. The former head of the University of Michigan’s athletic department, he helped turn around Domino’s Pizza, another private equity investment. But he lacked extensive experience in the toy industry. By the time he joined Toys “R” Us, the company faced a conundrum. After a lack of investment, its stores were in need of a serious overhaul. Many American customers complained about its sprawling spaces and tired displays. But it was unclear whether those investments would pay off when parents were shopping increasingly on their laptops and smartphones. Money, too, was tight. Most of its debt, totaling about $5 billion, had not been paid down since the buyout 12 years earlier. It was paying $400 million in interest payments each year. Advertisement “This company had a long history of taking on debt and kicking the can down the road for 10 years, and refinancing,” said Douglas M. Foley, a lawyer at McGuireWoods, who is representing a lender in the Toys “R” Us bankruptcy. With sales falling and debt payments mounting, the company’s lawyer said in September that Toys “R” Us had “too much debt.” It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, seeking to shed some of its debt and reorganize its business. The company secured new loans to keep operating into the critical holiday selling season and said it would hire hundreds of seasonal workers to help improve customer service. But the holidays were a bust for Toys “R” Us, even as other retailers reported strong sales. On Thursday, the company said that its earnings during the shopping season were $250 million less than expected. The lenders, which had given the company considerable leeway during the holidays, lost confidence in the turnaround plan. “The business plan was underwhelming, that is best way to say it,” Mr. Foley said. The company has been hemorrhaging money. Mr. Foley calculated that the company had spent nearly $50 million on legal, banking and consulting fees from September through January. The lenders determined that they needed to stop burning through cash and start selling off the company’s inventory and real estate. The company said on Thursday that it talked to several possible buyers of its American operations. But it could not complete a sale, leading to its demise. “The retail industry is going through such a convulsion, it is not clear what the end of the road looks like,” said Stephen B. Selbst, a bankruptcy lawyer at Herrick Feinstein. “If you are an equity investor, you probably think ‘you know what? I have other uses for my money.” A version of this article appears in print on March 16, 2018, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: This Toy Story Foreshadowed Its Sad Ending.

 (Reuters) - Toy retailer Toys 'R' Us Inc on Thursday asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for approval to stop paying all of its suppliers while it tries to line up buyers for its international business ahead of a planned liquidation of its U.S. operations. The iconic toy store's plan to liquidate inventory and shutter or sell its U.S. stores has put 30,000 jobs at risk and left vendors wondering where to send merchandise stuck on ships and trucks, and whether their invoices will ever get paid, lawyers said at a court hearing on Thursday. As shoppers flock to Amazon.com Inc and children choose smartphones and screens over toys, Toys 'R' Us has struggled to boost sales and service debt following a $6.6-billion leveraged buyout by private equity firms in 2005. At a hearing at U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Richmond, Virginia, Toys 'R' Us lawyer Joshua Sussberg said the company was working to avoid any contagion from the U.S. liquidation on the foreign businesses it is trying to sell. Advertisement Part of that effort means separating the U.S. business from foreign operations to ensure that shipments can reach stores in Canada, Europe and Asia, where the company will be reviewing bid proposals in coming weeks. Advertisement But lawyers for vendors said they did not know whether they would ever get paid for those goods. Kenneth Eckstein, a lawyer on behalf of the official committee of unsecured creditors, called the precipitous liquidation ""extremely disappointing and sad,"" noting that hundreds of vendors, thousands of employees and millions of customers will suffer. ""This is the largest and most rapid deterioration of a retailer and maybe that any Chapter 11 has ever entertained,"" he said. LIQUIDATION Toys 'R' Us - the last major retailer focusing solely on toys - plans to liquidate inventory at 735 U.S. stores, including Babies 'R' Us locations, by the end of this year. The wind-down follows a bruising holiday season, when the company failed to stay competitive and sales came in well below projections. The quarter accounts for 40 percent of its annual net sales. With the disappearance of Toys 'R' Us, everything from squishies and slime kits made by small companies, to board games and Barbie dolls by heavyweights Hasbro Inc and Mattel Inc, will lose a top customer. Hasbro said the pending liquidation and closure is expected to be ""disruptive"" in the near term. Lutz Muller, president of consultancy Klosters Trading Corp, estimated a single-digit sales impact on companies like Mattel, Hasbro, Spin Master Corp, Jakks Pacific Inc, Funko Inc and MGA Entertainment Inc. ""Bad but not fatal,"" Muller said. ""But for the little guys that depended on Toys 'R' Us as a major showcase ... a large number will go to the wall."" Jefferies predicted the bankruptcy would depress 2018 revenue across the industry by between 2.5 percent and 5.5 percent. It said 40 percent of the toy sales up for grabs would flow to Amazon and 30 percent to Walmart Inc.  . Shares of Mattel fell nearly 3 percent while shares of Hasbro were trading slightly lower on Thursday; they had tumbled last week on Toys 'R' Us' liquidation reports. Advertisement Toys 'R' Us' creditors said in a court filing that Target Corp, Walmart and Amazon pricing toys at low margins, and a greater-than-expected decline in toy and gift card sales following its bankruptcy filing in September, led to the weak performance in the quarter. TOYS ABROAD Wayne, New Jersey-based Toys 'R' Us was already in the process of closing one-fifth of its stores as part of an attempt to emerge from one of the largest ever bankruptcies by a specialty retailer. In September, when the company operated more than 1,600 stores globally, with roughly 800 stores outside the United States, it got court permission to borrow more than $2 billion to start paying suppliers. But efforts to keep the business going collapsed after lenders decided they could recover more in a liquidation by closing stores and raising money from merchandise sales. Seventy-year-old Toys 'R' Us does not rule out a last-minute offer for all of its stores and said it will announce the winning bidder of a March 29 auction on April 12. More than 8,000 U.S. retail stores closed in 2017, roughly double the average annual store closures in the previous decade, according to data from the International Council of Shopping Centers. Despite the threat of 30,000 job losses, experts do not expect retail employment and wages to be subdued in the near term. Approximately 700,000 jobs in the industry need to be filled, say retail staffing firms and trade federations such as the NRF. Aly Sanchez, a two-year employee of Toys R Us in Kansas City, said, ""It's an overwhelming feeling not knowing what’s going to happen. And if we do close, we don't know if we'll even get severance pay.""

 Good Thursday.

Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. There will be no roadshow. No ringing of the bell. No party or C.E.O interview from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Spotify, the streaming music service, is eschewing the traditional initial public offering for a direct listing and is taking its pitch directly to retail investors, streaming its presentation on its website Thursday. Advertisement Here are a few takeaways: Why a direct listing? The post-I.P.O. lockup period, during which employees can’t sell shares. “We have allowed shareholders and employees to buy and sell stock for years,” said Daniel Ek, Spotify’s C.E.O.and founder, said. “That shouldn’t stop just because our stock is more widely owned.” Advertisement The company is also well capitalized with positive free cash flow and no debt. Room to Grow? The number of smartphone users to continues to grow but Spotify said it only reaches a small portion within the countries it operates. The company is also working with auto makers to integrate its platform with cars, where more than 30 percent of music listening happens. Apple and Amazon are a big risk to Spotify’s business? Tech giants like Apple, Amazon and Google each have their own streaming music services. Spotify’s service is delivered over Apple’s iPhone and Amazon’s Echo. Those companies could prioritize their own services on their devices. What is the next date to watch? March 26. That’s the date when Spotify will release first-quarter results and 2018 guidance. What is “algotorial?” It’s the term that Spotify’s head of research and development used to describe the mix of algorithms and humans that Spotify uses to curate its music. Regulators recently penalized Wells Fargo for years of misconduct, but on Wednesday, the bank gave its C.E.O. a hearty pay rise. How did that happen? The numbers: Timothy J. Sloan’s compensation for 2017 totaled $17.6 million, a 35 percent increase from the $13 million he earned in 2016. His stock award for 2017 was $15 million, a big jump from $10.5 million in 2016. Is the increase justified, given the bank’s issues? Wells Fargo would no doubt point to the fact that Mr. Sloan decided to forgo a cash bonus in 2017. John G. Stumpf, a former C.E.O., got a $4 million cash bonus in 2015, for instance. Also, Mr. Sloan’s stock award was set in February last year and reflects his promotion in 2016 to C.E.O. And if Wells Fargo slips up badly over the next three years, Mr. Sloan may not get the entire $15 million stock award. Advertisement How does Mr. Sloan’s pay stack up against others? He is making less than the C.E.O. of Bank of America, Brian T. Moynihan, who made $21.8 million last year. But Mr. Sloan is making quite a bit more than the chief executives of large regional banks. US Bank’s chief executive, Andrew Cecere, had 2017 compensation of $12 million. But Mr. Sloan looks overpaid on a new metric that public companies must provide. This yardstick compares a C.E.O.’s pay with that of the median employee’s pay. Mr. Sloan’s 2017 pay was 291 times that of Wells Fargo’s median earner. That is above the 250 times for Mr. Moynihan. And Mr. Sloan’s ratio is far in excess of Mr. Cecere’s 205 times. — Peter Eavis One of President Trump’s most prominent supporters in the business world on Thursday said the United States would have the upper hand against China in a trade skirmish. Peter Thiel, a technology entrepreneur with libertarian leanings, told the Economic Club of New York that the United States doesn’t export enough to China to make it vulnerable to Chinese retaliation. If Mr. Trump imposed trade restrictions on Chinese goods, as he may in the coming weeks, China could do the same to United States exports. Mr. Thiel seemed unfazed by that. “It’s quite unclear where China can reciprocate because we are exporting so little,” he said. Mr. Thiel’s views echo those of Mr. Trump. 
            When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore-we win big. It’s easy!         The American exports to China are not small. They totaled $184 billion in the 12 months through the end of September 2017. That makes China the United States’ fourth-largest export market after the European Union, Canada and Mexico. The United States, however, imports far more from China than it exports, which means the deficit with China is far larger than it is with Mexico and the European Union. - Peter Eavis The blood-testing start-up was once one of Silicon Valley’s most lauded unicorns. But, the S.E.C. says, it deceived investors about what its tech could do and how much business it did. And its founder Elizabeth Holmes — a Stanford dropout who was compared favorably to Steve Jobs — has been stripped of her C.E.O. title and her shares. More from John Carreyrou of the WSJ, who first reported on issues at Theranos: Many Theranos investors have lost the entire value of their investment. The losses for [Rupert] Murdoch, once the company’s largest investor, total more than $100 million, people familiar with the matter said. The S.E.C. said in its civil lawsuit Wednesday that Theranos was “on the verge of bankruptcy” in late 2017. The company has been kept afloat by a loan from a private-equity firm that is secured by Theranos’s patents. Matt Levine of Bloomberg View reminds us about the company’s other victims: patients. Peter Henning’s take: The S.E.C.’s case shows that it considers privately held companies as capable of defrauding investors as publicly traded ones. Elsewhere in S.E.C. violations: The agency charged a former Equifax executive with insider trading, saying he sold shares after learning of the company’s data breach before it was publicly reported. It’s official: The CNBC commentator will become President Trump’s chief economic adviser, replacing Gary Cohn. But what will Mr. Kudlow — who on TV is an ardent supporter of free trade — push for? Advertisement He supports a strong dollar and tariffs that make exceptions for allies like Canada and Mexico. And he’s in favor of permanently extending the Republican tax cuts for individuals. As for his stance on China, here’s what he told CNBC: “A thought that I have is the United States could lead a coalition of large trading partners and allies against China, or to let China know that they’re breaking the rules left and right.” One thing to watch for: whether his past admission of substance abuse would affect his work. “We’ll see how that plays out,” Mr. Kudlow said. Critics’ corner: Mark Hamrick, Bankrate.com’s senior economic analyst, writes, “It remains to be seen whether Kudlow can step into the role of a virtual moderating influence in this administration.” And Noah Smith of Bloomberg View asserts, “It also seems like there are just so few credible economic thinkers willing to stand up and sign their name to the Trump economic agenda.” Elsewhere in economic policy: U.S. companies have few ways around the proposed metals tariffs. And U.S. allies might emphasize their toughness against China to win tariff exemptions. Mr. Kudlow has prognosticated on many economic and political issues, often in a way that mirrors his future boss. His predictions, which will soon carry new weight as the president’s top economic adviser, have not always been on the mark. Our colleagues Deborah Solomon and Kitty Bennett take a look at some of Mr. Kudlow’s not-so-on-the-money calls. Here are a few of the ones they found: In 2005 “All the bond bears have been dead wrong in predicting sky-high mortgage rates. So have all the bubbleheads who expect housing-price crashes in Las Vegas or Naples, Fla., to bring down the consumer, the rest of the economy and the entire stock market.” (Well, we all know what happened. By 2008, home prices were in a free-fall, threatening to plunge the financial system and the economy into the abyss.) In 1993 “There’s no question that President Clinton’s across-the-board tax increases on labor, capital and energy will throw a wet blanket over the recovery and depress the economy’s long-run potential to grow.” (The period between 1990 and 1999 was the longest bull market in history. The S&P 500 more than tripled during that time.) Advertisement In 2015 “Given the recent rise of presidential candidate Donald Trump, we should all be thankful that stocks haven’t plunged. Trump’s agenda of trade protectionism, dollar devaluation, and immigrant deportation is completely anti-growth. It’s like Fortress America in an economy that is completely globalized and where the U.S. must compete in the worldwide race for capital and labor. Trump’s policies don’t fit.” (President Trump was elected and the stock market has only climbed. ) • How Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone became a close adviser to President Trump on China — but lost the tariff battle.

(NYT) An extortion plot related to his cocaine addiction. Mr. Skipper told The Hollywood Reporter: “In December, someone from whom I bought cocaine attempted to extort me.” “They threatened me, and I understood immediately that threat put me and my family at risk, and this exposure would put my professional life at risk as well. I foreclosed that possibility by disclosing the details to my family, and then when I discussed it with Bob, he and I agreed that I had placed the company in an untenable position and as a result, I should resign.” The WSJ reports that the Chinese online shopping giant is working on a plan to list shares in its home market. Such a listing would come nearly four years after Alibaba went public on the New York Stock Exchange, in what is the still the world’s largest initial public offering.

Christian Bittar, a former senior trader at Deutsche Bank, pleaded guilty earlier this month to conspiracy to defraud in the manipulation of a global benchmark interest rate known as Euribor, the Serious Fraud Office said on Thursday. A court in Britain lifted an order on Thursday that prevented the media from reporting his plea. “It would not be right to make comment prior to the trial of the remaining defendants and prior to Mr. Bittar’s sentencing,” David Savell, a lawyer for Mr. Bittar, said. Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $2.5 billion in penalties in 2015 related to the benchmark interest rate rigging scandal.

 SAO PAULO —  Amazon.com Inc met in Brazil last week with an array of manufacturers to discuss plans to stock and sell products from consumer electronics to perfume in the country, according to two people that took part in the meetings. The move would take the U.S. e-commerce giant beyond its current role in Brazil as a marketplace for third-party sellers, representing a major advance into the biggest retail market in Latin America. Amazon representatives in Brazil declined to comment on the talks, adding that the company had held ""hundreds of meetings with potential vendors and suppliers about its business in Brazil and possible future plans"" in the past five years. Amazon has waded slowly into Brazil's complex and highly competitive online retail market, starting with e-book sales in 2012, adding physical books two years later and offering third-party sales of electronics in October. Advertisement Yet the company appears to be accelerating its expansion this year as the Brazilian economy exits a painful recession, stiffening competition for local rivals such as Mercado Libre Inc, B2w Cia Digital, Via Varejo SA and Magazine Luiza SA. Advertisement Shares of Magazine Luiza fell 2 percent in Thursday trading and Via Vareja dropped nearly 3 percent. B2W, which reported a quarterly loss and a change of chief executives on Wednesday, tumbled 10 percent, while the benchmark Bovespa stock index was little changed.  . Last month, the same stocks suffered when Reuters reported that Amazon was looking to lease a large warehouse just outside of Sao Paulo. E-commerce accounts for around 5 percent of Brazil's roughly $300 billion retail market — about half its share in the United States — but has doubled in the past four years and is forecast to keep growing annually at a double-digit pace. Amazon representatives, including senior executive Ticiana Mártyres, told several dozen potential suppliers gathered at the Hotel Blue Tree Morumbi last week that the company planned to use its own transportation and call centers in Brazil, according to one of the sources. ""They said they were going to buy directly from the manufacturers and resell,"" said the person, who requested anonymity due to the confidential terms of the talks. Amazon said it would store goods at its facilities in Greater Sao Paulo, the source added.

Foxconnn, whose clients include Amazon, Apple , Cisco, Dell [DI.UL], Huawei [HWT.UL] and Lenovo, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission confirmed the approval in statements issued on Thursday. This followed an earlier Reuters report that the Foxconn unit had obtained the regulatory go-ahead for the planned IPO.

 Judith Pearson’s home in rural Minnesota is stocked with guns for hunting and recreational use, but that didn’t stop her from venting her frustration with the National Rifle Association after the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla. Ms. Pearson, a retired school principal, was irked by the group’s repeated efforts to preserve civilian access to semiautomatic rifles, like the AR-15 the gunman used to kill 17 students and school staff members. “BoycottNRA,” she wrote to her handful of Twitter followers on the day of the attack, becoming one of the first participants in what became a sprawling campaign to force corporate America to dissociate itself from the gun lobby. Across the country, in Los Angeles, Laura Mannino had a similar thought. Drain the NRA, an advocacy group she co-founded in October after a deadly shooting in Las Vegas, developed a public spreadsheet of businesses associated with the gun group. After the attack in Florida, Ms. Mannino helped organize a rally against gun violence in downtown Los Angeles that drew hundreds of people. “Everyone started, in parallel ways, but in tandem, to go after these companies,” she said. Since the Parkland massacre, a range of people and coalitions have converged on the nationwide battleground over gun control. That includes individuals trying to make a statement, activist organizations sensing a shift in sentiment, informal parents’ clubs, marketing executives, niche media groups, celebrities and shooting survivors. Advertisement Through an uncoordinated but simpatico collection of Twitter hashtags, retweeted lists, Facebook groups, online petitions and carefully orchestrated campaigns, the protest has pushed a major bank, several car rental companies, two airlines and other businesses to publicly cut ties with the N.R.A. Advertisement On Monday night, the insurance broker Lockton Affinity was the latest to join a list of more than a dozen companies that includes the insurance provider MetLife, the cybersecurity firm Symantec, and the automobile pricing and information website TrueCar. Unlike hundreds of other boycotts that barely registered with consumers, the current effort has “taken on significant symbolic purpose” and speed, said Lawrence B. Glickman, a history professor and boycotts expert at Cornell University. “This wasn’t a concerted thing — it just took off and took on a life of its own,” Professor Glickman said. “It’s stunning — nothing like this has ever happened before with the N.R.A. as far as I know.” The #BoycottNRA hashtag, the unofficial unifier of the movement, was trending on Twitter on Friday and appeared more than 10,000 times in a single four-hour period on Monday, according to the analytics service ExportTweet. The hashtag has floated around social media since before the Sandy Hook massacre in late 2012, usually bubbling up after high-profile mass shootings only to quickly fade after failing to inspire much action. After the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida on Feb. 14, two dozen tweets mentioned the hashtag, followed by three dozen more the next day. But the calls for a boycott remained vague until last week, when lists of companies linked to the N.R.A. began tearing across social media. Posts from popular accounts were retweeted thousands of times. Advertisement ThinkProgress, a news website with a liberal bent, was among the first to spread the names, updating a list on Feb. 20 that it first published after the Sandy Hook shooting. It also published a report that the website for the N.R.A.’s official credit card was down. On Thursday, the First National Bank of Omaha, which issued the credit card, publicly confirmed its break from the N.R.A. “Then the floodgates were open,” said Judd Legum, who founded ThinkProgress. “Lots of people began moving very, very fast.” The pressure on companies to cut ties with the N.R.A. soon began sprouting up from various sources. Students who survived the Parkland shooting, who have become vocal proponents of gun control — and some of whom now have hundreds of thousands of social media followers — began pressuring specific companies to follow the bank’s lead. The massive asset manager BlackRock demanded information about the gun industry’s presence in investment portfolios. There were also calls for banks and payment processing companies to refuse firearms-related transactions.  . Facebook posts and petitions from parents in Brooklyn, hiking enthusiasts and bike shops urged consumers and retailers like REI not to support CamelBak hydration packs and Bell helmets. Those brands are owned by Vista Outdoor, which also makes guns and ammunition. Celebrities including Alyssa Milano and Denis O’Hare began backing a push to stop Amazon and other streaming sites from supporting the NRATV online video channel. Unaware of the Hollywood campaign, Brad Chase, a communications consultant who in the past has worked with some of the brands that distanced themselves from the N.R.A., staged his own protest against Amazon after seeing screen grabs of the N.R.A.’s content streaming on its platforms. He and a longtime friend, whose son survived the Parkland shooting, initiated a petition on Thursday that asked people to “flood Amazon’s Legal Department with calls.” The pair hoped for 5,000 signatures. By Tuesday afternoon, they had more than 200,000. “We know we’re not going to change this epidemic of gun violence overnight, but this is one of those things people can do right now while we wait for the slow wheels of government to take action,” Mr. Chase said. 
                When a gunman walked into a Florida school on Feb. 14, his rifle let him fire in much the same way that many American soldiers and Marines would fire M16 and M4 rifles in combat.             So far, Amazon has not issued any comment related to the N.R.A. Some companies have resisted calls to sever business relationships with the N.R.A. On Monday, FedEx said that while it disagreed with the N.R.A.’s policies on semiautomatic firearms, it would continue to offer discounts to the group’s members. Advertisement The N.R.A. itself has accused companies of “a shameful display of political and civic cowardice” and said that “in time, these brands will be replaced by others.” Since that statement on Saturday, the divisive debate has inspired some gun rights supporters to post about joining the N.R.A., using the hashtag #TweetYourNRAMembership. Many N.R.A. supporters have also vowed not to patronize the brands that ended relationships with the gun group. Still, the boycott effort — parts of it organic, parts of it carefully orchestrated — was an impressive show of force against the gun lobby. Shannon Watts, who founded the activist group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America after the Sandy Hook massacre, said her group had successfully persuaded hundreds of companies like Starbucks to block guns in their stores. The organization has more than 100,000 active volunteers it can quickly mobilize to create graphics, send email blasts and fan out over social media. But after Parkland, Moms Demand Action adopted hashtags that others had created and cheered on campaigns that others had organized. “The more the merrier — it’s been a cumulative effort of different groups within the same space, all putting pressure on the N.R.A.,” Ms. Watts said. “What this has shown is that it doesn’t have to be any one specific group or person — it’s more about the overall noise than any single hashtag.” Follow Tiffany Hsu on Twitter: @tiffkhsu.

 LONDON — Comcast may have found a way to disrupt Walt Disney Company’s plan to buy most of 21st Century Fox: topping Fox’s bid to buy the British satellite broadcaster Sky with its own $31 billion takeover offer. The bid, plans for which were announced on Tuesday, seizes upon 21st Century Fox’s difficulties buying the piece of Sky that it does not already own. British regulators have expressed repeated concerns about giving Rupert Murdoch and his family more control over the country’s media, stretching the approval process out over more than a year and forcing 21st Century Fox to offer more concessions. Comcast has said that buying Sky would help it expand in Europe, where the broadcaster has 23 million customers and owns rights to show the English Premier League and other professional soccer leagues. Disney, too, has been keen on expanding internationally, with the British company serving as an important part of its $52 billion plan to buy a significant portion of 21st Century Fox. Whoever prevails, it will shake up Disney’s plans. Either 21st Century Fox will have to pay more for Sky, or Disney will lose a valuable international property to Comcast. Advertisement In a statement, 21st Century Fox said that it “remains committed to its recommended cash offer for Sky,” which it made in 2016. Advertisement Disney, Comcast and others are rushing to strike major deals in a swiftly changing media landscape. AT&T has bid more than $85 billion to take over Time Warner, a proposed merger that the Justice Department is attempting to block. Consumers increasingly stream their movies and televisions shows over the internet. Upstart technology companies like Apple and Amazon nurture ambitions to rival Hollywood’s big studios. Online broadcasters are even increasingly bidding for the rights to show sports — long a major moneymaking business for traditional broadcasters and cable operators. The saga over Sky has been one of the most drawn out deal-making dramas in media. Mr. Murdoch, the 21st Century Fox executive chairman, has tried for years to take full control of the broadcaster, which he started in 1989. By owning the rest of Sky, 21st Century Fox would be better positioned to take on the likes of Netflix, Amazon and other streaming giants. In 2011, Mr. Murdoch was forced to withdraw a $12 billion offer for the rest of Sky as a firestorm erupted over phone hacking by the news media in Britain. The scandal eventually led to the closing of The News of the World, the first newspaper Mr. Murdoch acquired in Britain in the late 1960s. In December 2016, 21st Century Fox tried again, in an effort to expand its global reach and cement Mr. Murdoch’s legacy. The company agreed to buy the 61 percent of Sky that it does not own for about $16 billion. While the Office of Communications, or Ofcom, ruled in June that Mr. Murdoch and other company executives were “fit and proper” to hold broadcasting licenses in Britain, it also said that the deal warranted more scrutiny. In the regulator’s view, the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News had amounted to “significant corporate failures.” Then last month, Britain’s competition regulator provisionally rejected the deal, saying that it was “not in the public interest.” The regulator said it was concerned that the deal would give the Murdoch family “too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda.” It noted at the time that Murdoch-controlled outlets, which include the newspapers The Sun and The Times of London, were already consumed by nearly a third of Britain’s population. In hopes of winning over regulators, 21st Century Fox has offered to establish a “fully independent” editorial board for Sky News and to continue to fund the Sky News brand after the transaction for at least 10 years. Advertisement 21st Century Fox had hoped to complete the Sky deal before the Disney sale was finalized. But Comcast’s move just adds uncertainty to an already complicated process. Disney, which declined to comment on Comcast’s proposal, must now decide how much it cares about Sky. It is also not clear if Disney would want to end up being partners with Comcast, in the event that Comcast wins majority control of Sky and Disney ultimately has Fox’s 39 percent stake. While announcing the planned purchase of Fox’s entertainment assets in December, Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, singled out Sky as “a real crown jewel” in a television interview with Bloomberg. “We certainly would be looking forward to the opportunity to have Sky be part of our company,” he said.  . Comcast has circled 21st Century Fox in the past. Last year, the cable giant was in preliminary talks to buy the entertainment assets owned by 21st Century Fox, including the minority stake in Sky. Disney ultimately prevailed. At the very least, Comcast has most likely made it more expensive for 21st Century Fox to buy all of Sky. Under the terms of its proposed bid, Comcast said, it would pay 12.50 pounds, about $17.50, a share in cash. That would represent a premium of 13 percent over its closing price on Monday and is about 16 percent above 21st Century Fox’s current offer of £10.75. On Tuesday, shares of the British broadcaster jumped by nearly one-fifth. The stock surge suggested investors expected 21st Century Fox to back away or come back with an even better offer. Comcast shareholders seemed less pleased. The company’s stock price dropped more than 6 percent in midday trading, to about $37. Disney shares fell 4 percent, to about $105.50, and Fox shares declined 2.6 percent, to about $37.80. An influential media analyst, Craig Moffett, who follows Comcast for MoffettNathanson, wrote in a research note that the Sky offer had positive aspects, including offering Comcast’s entertainment unit, NBCUniversal, broader distribution in Europe. Still, “Comcast will have to twist themselves into knots to explain why satellite distribution won’t be just as obsolete in Europe as it already is in the U.S.,” Mr. Moffett said. “Perhaps worst of all, this morning’s bid doesn’t really put to rest the idea that they might still try a topping bid for Fox’s U.S. assets, including the rest of Sky” if the Justice Department ends up approving AT&T’s takeover of Time Warner. Advertisement “The notion that Comcast might make a topping bid for Fox has weighed heavily on Comcast shares,” he added. For either Comcast or Disney, Sky offers a platform for international expansion. Comcast said in a statement that about a quarter of its revenue would come from international operations should it seal a deal with Sky, up from 9 percent currently. In addition to its other businesses, Sky has also announced plans to start streaming services in Spain and Switzerland. “We look at Sky as a media company: Sky News, Sky Sports, Sky Movies,” Brian L. Roberts, Comcast’s chairman and chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts. “There’s tremendous presence in the content creation, not just the distribution.” In a research note on Tuesday, Polo Tang, a UBS analyst, said that Sky could be “strategically interesting” to a variety of bidders, given its content and its broadcast and streaming distribution network. It also recently retained the rights to the Premier League at a lower cost than analysts had expected. Mr. Tang said that the benign outcome of the Premier League auction potentially “gives Fox scope to raise its offers.” Comcast said it was seeking control of more than half of Sky’s shares with Tuesday’s offer but was ultimately interested in acquiring all of the British broadcaster. In a statement, Sky urged shareholders to take no action yet. The broadcaster added that its independent directors “are mindful of their fiduciary duties and their obligations under the U.K. Takeover Code.” Follow Chad Bray on Twitter: @Chadbray Brooks Barnes contributed reporting from Los Angeles.

 ATLANTA — Delta Air Lines, one of Georgia’s largest private-sector employers, is among the glossiest corporate jewels in the state, contributing billions of dollars a year to the economy. Its hundreds of daily flights in and out of Atlanta’s airport are the main reason Georgia’s capital can brag, with justification, that it is a truly international city. “Delta is the Atlanta international airport, and our airport is, you know, the fuel that generates our commercial community,” said Sam Massell, the city’s former mayor. But prestige, boosterism and corporate coddling — all cherished concepts in Georgia — took a back seat this week to the national debate over gun control. In the wake of the Florida school shooting, the airline announced it was ending a promotional discount with the National Rifle Association, and suddenly found itself in the rare position of being openly dressed down — and potentially punished — by Republicans who control the statehouse. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle of Georgia, a Republican who presides over the State Senate and has received an A-plus grade from the N.R.A., joined other conservative lawmakers this week in threatening to remove a $50 million sales tax exemption on jet fuel that some hoped would encourage Delta to open even more routes — and help Atlanta attract even more national and international companies. Advertisement The conservative backlash highlighted the challenge confronting corporations around the country that are struggling to cater to both ends of America’s increasingly distant political and cultural poles. Advertisement As pressure from social media and advocacy groups has intensified, and calls for boycotts mount, more than a dozen companies have severed business ties with the N.R.A. since the massacre in Parkland, Fla. Just as quickly, a counteroffensive arose from gun supporters excoriating the companies for their stance, forcing business leaders to navigate the treacherous ground where social responsibility, ideology and financial impact converge. Delta did not respond on Tuesday to Mr. Cagle’s threat or amplify its stance regarding the N.R.A. In a statement over the weekend, the company said its decision to stop offering discounted fares to the N.R.A. “reflects the airline’s neutral status in the current national debate over gun control amid recent school shootings.” As of Tuesday afternoon, the jet-fuel tax break, while opposed by Mr. Cagle and some other conservative Republicans, had not yet been stripped out of a broader Senate tax bill. Delta chose to end special discounts, but FedEx took a different approach, one that highlighted the delicate balancing act. In a statement Monday, FedEx said it disagreed with the N.R.A.’s stance on civilian access to assault rifles but would continue to offer discounts of up to 26 percent to the group’s members. “We are very clear that, when we set pricing strategy or look to adjust pricing, it is not based on political positions or points of view,” Patrick Fitzgerald, the company’s senior vice president, integrated marketing and communications, said in an interview on Tuesday. “But we do have a very clear corporate position in terms of gun safety and school safety.” In Georgia, the debate has been surprisingly fiery, even in a state long defined by tensions between the liberal metropolis and conservative countryside, and between the values of global corporate culture and those of Southern Republicans. “Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,” Mr. Cagle, a leading G.O.P. candidate for governor, wrote in a tweet Monday, in which he announced that he would “kill any tax legislation” that benefited Delta unless it changed its position. Advertisement State Senator Josh McKoon said in an interview Tuesday that he was put off by Delta’s assertion that it was trying to remain neutral on the guns issue, when it had taken positions on other social topics in the past. “It just came off as very disingenuous,” Mr. McKoon said of Delta’s statement. Referring to Mr. Cagle’s pushback, Mr. McKoon said, “I think he captured the sentiment and the feeling of a lot of Georgians,” who, he said, were frustrated “with Delta weighing in on an issue that has nothing to do with the topic of transportation, for sure.” But Mr. Massell, the former mayor who is president of the Buckhead Coalition, an influential Atlanta business and civic group, called the entire debate “embarrassing.” He said that he feared the threat against Delta would scare away Amazon, the online retail giant that has listed Atlanta among the finalists for its second headquarters.  . “I don’t believe in blackmail, and I’m sorry to use such a dirty word, but that’s almost what it tastes like,” said Mr. Massell, a Democrat who served as mayor from 1970 to 1974. “That’s terrible. That’s not Georgia’s image. That’s backwoods stuff that doesn’t belong at all.” The story of Delta and the story of Atlanta have been deeply intertwined for decades. The company was founded in Louisiana in the 1920s; it focused, in the earliest days, on crop dusting, in an effort to end the boll weevil infestation that had ruined many Southern cotton crops. The company moved to Atlanta in 1941. In subsequent decades, the city, which was founded as a railroad hub, invested heavily in its airport, and pushed a message that it was more socially tolerant than other Southern cities like Birmingham. It was a winning combination. Today, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the busiest in the world, and Delta employs more than 33,000 Georgia residents. 
                When a gunman walked into a Florida school on Feb. 14, his rifle let him fire in much the same way that many American soldiers and Marines would fire M16 and M4 rifles in combat.             Its current problem with the legislature has prompted leaders in other states to woo Delta via Twitter. “You know, in mathematics, Delta represents the change in something,” wrote Randall Woodfin, the mayor of Birmingham. He added, “Let’s chat.” Michael Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business and faculty director of the Center for Social Impact, said in an interview that “Delta has every right to tell legislators, ‘We’re not of a mind to do your bidding.’ They could easily pack their bags and move away from Atlanta and go to Dallas.” But it seemed unlikely that the airline would move. In 2016, the company signed an airport lease with the city that would keep its headquarters in Atlanta through 2036. Advertisement “Atlanta and Georgia and the business community usually try to work together and Delta is a huge employer in this state,” said another former Atlanta mayor, Shirley Franklin. “So the relationship is damaged, if nothing else.” A broader concern, shared by some liberals, conservatives and members of the Georgia business community, is that gun control may now join other hot-button cultural topics that may damage the state’s reputation among national and global corporations that do not adhere to the same conservative Southern values as the state legislature. In the last few years, the legislature has taken up a number of prominent bills that critics say would allow for discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Gov. Nathan Deal vetoed one of them, a so-called religious liberty bill, in 2016, after some of the state’s most prestigious and powerful companies — including Delta, Home Depot and Coca-Cola — openly opposed the measure. Mr. Deal, a Republican, will soon leave office because of term limits. Mr. Cagle, a leading candidate to replace him, is among a number of Republican hopefuls who say they will continue to support the legislation, which would have strengthened legal protection for opponents of same-sex marriage. Mr. McKoon, a Republican who is leaving the upper chamber to run for secretary of state, said that he had long opposed the jet-fuel tax break on the grounds that it seemed like a handout for a politically connected industry. Mr. McKoon was a vocal supporter of the 2016 religious liberty bill that Mr. Deal vetoed. He said that when that legislation failed, he issued a warning, saying that liberals would continue pressuring companies to embrace progressive social positions. He warned, he said, that “the next logical step would be to attack gun rights. And I think we are seeing the beginning of that.” An earlier version of this article, using information provided by a consulting firm working for Delta Air Lines, misstated the airline’s estimate of its economic impact on Georgia. It is $43.5 billion, not $435 billion.

 Happy Tuesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Comcast is fighting Fox over the British broadcaster Sky. • How will Powell discuss loose fiscal policy? • Delta shows pushing back against the N.R.A. has political costs. • Will the U.S. challenge Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm on national security grounds? Want this in your inbox? Sign up here. Comcast may have found a way to disrupt Walt Disney’s deal for a large part of 21st Century Fox: make a bid to buy the British satellite broadcaster Sky. The offer, writes Liam Proud of Breakingviews, leaves Fox with two unappealing options to save its deal with Disney. Rupert Murdoch can either “revise the terms of the Disney sale to exclude Sky, or enter into a bidding war with” Comcast. Advertisement Sky investors seem to be betting on the latter option. Its stock jumped nearly 20 percent and is now trading above Comcast’s offer. Advertisement The reason for that may be that “both Fox and Disney have reasons for wanting to possess all of Sky,” writes Chris Hughes of Bloomberg Gadfly. “Fox may want full ownership as an insurance policy against the sale to Disney failing. And Disney’s desire to buy Fox’s current stake in Sky suggests it likes the asset, wants more of it and would want to prevent Comcast owning it.” In fact, Robert Iger, Disney’s chief executive, has called Sky the crown jewel of his company’s purchase of Fox assets. Reaction • Frank Louthan, an analyst at Raymond James: “The potential for Fox to return and make a competing bid remains high, in our view, as our European investment team believes Sky is the best-in-class European leader in Pay-TV.” When is an offer an offer can be a fine point under Britain’s complicated takeover rules. On Tuesday, Comcast announced a “possible all-cash offer” to acquire Sky, the British satellite broadcaster, for about $31 billion . Sky and 21st Century Fox, which has been trying to acquire the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own for more than year, both responded that “no firm offer” had been made. That may seem like an odd distinction when Comcast, the owner of NBCUniversal, announced publicly how much it is willing to pay for an asset to kick off negotiations. But, that comes down to Britain’s extensive takeover code, which spans more than 400 pages, and can often trip up American companies not used to operating under those rules. The public disclosure of merger talks is triggered under the code when a number of factors occur, such as rumors in the market that a deal is in the works or “untoward movement” in a takeover target’s stock price. Advertisement Making a public announcement then starts a countdown clock for a potential acquirer to announce a formal offer under the rules, known as a so-called firm intention to make an offer. The rules are intended to make sure all shareholders are treated fairly and have access to the same information about a deal and to establish an orderly framework for takeovers. - Chad Bray We’d waited to see if Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chairman and C.E.O., would challenge Walt Disney for control of 21st Century Fox. Instead, he plans to disrupt Mr. Murdoch’s bid for full control of Sky, the British satellite broadcaster. What Comcast is offering: £12.50, or about $17.50, a share for all of Sky What Fox is offering: £10.75 a share for the 61 percent of Sky that it doesn’t own Behind the maneuvers Comcast had worked on its own offer for Fox, with the chance to expand internationally through Sky being a big reason for bidding. But the Murdochs and their advisers believed that it would be difficult for Comcast to win U.S. regulatory approval. However, Fox’s bid for Sky has been held up by questions by British regulators about whether Mr. Murdoch was fit and proper to control a major broadcaster in the U.K. That presented Comcast’s opportunity. What Mr. Roberts said in Comcast’s regulatory statement: “We already have a strong presence in London, and Comcast intends to use Sky as a platform for our growth in Europe.” Whom to thank for the Comcast bid 
            Someone needs to find this cabbie pic.twitter.com/lH4SFcggcp  Critics’ corner • Paul Richards of the media research firm Numis told the FT that Comcast’s bid is a “very strong competitive offer.” Advertisement • Alex DeGroote at Cenkos Securities told Bloomberg, “The market was anticipating another approach and will be pleasantly surprised.” Market reaction Comcast investors don’t seem pleasantly surprised. Shares of Comcast are down 5.2 percent. Sky’s stock popped nearly 20 percent and is now trading above Comcast’s offer. When Jerome H. Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday, we may see if he has mastered the art of stern but subtle disapproval. Congress has recently enacted tax cuts and spending increases that could stimulate the economy at a time when the Fed may want to tamp things down a bit. A tug of war could end up occurring between elected politicians wanting a boom to continue and a central bank that is concerned about government deficits and inflation. It is highly unlikely that Mr. Powell or any other Fed official would want to get drawn into a direct, public fight with members of Congress or the administration of President Donald Trump. So, how might Mr. Powell express concern about loose government fiscal policies? He can talk about Congress’s stimulus as just one of many factors that can have an impact on the Fed’s mission of creating the economic conditions for maximum employment and stable prices. In other words, he could depersonalize any tensions, and imply that concern about spending and deficits is just the Fed doing its job. And in his prepared testimony for the hearing, Mr. Powell noted the stimulus from fiscal policy. “In gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the F.O.M.C. will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing P.C.E. price inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis. While many factors shape the economic outlook, some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds: In particular, fiscal policy has become more stimulative and foreign demand for U.S. exports is on a firmer trajectory.” (F.O.M.C. is the Federal Open Market Committee, the committee that sets monetary policy, while P.C.E. price inflation is the Fed’s preferred measure of prices, derived from a survey of personal consumption expenditures conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.) Update from the hearing In this testimony before the House committee on Tuesday, Mr. Powell took some questions about the recent loosening of fiscal policy, and how the Fed might respond. Advertisement He followed the careful path outlined above. On the one hand, he noted that government finances can have an impact on economic conditions, saying: “Fiscal policy changes can have an effect.” He also said: “We really need to get on a sustainable fiscal path, and the time for doing that is now.” On the other hand, Mr. Powell said the Fed did not want to directly interfere in government spending decisions. “We don’t do fiscal policy at the Fed,” he said. — Peter Eavis That’s according to GeekWire and confirmed by CNBC.

Howard Schultz, the founder and executive chairman of Starbox, said during an interview with Fox Business that he is not running for president.

Schultz: “I said I am doing everything I possibly can as a private citizen to advance the cause of the country.” Bartiromo: “It sounds like you are running for president, Howard.” Schultz: “No I didn’t say that. Come on, Maria.” Mr. Schultz is one of a number of business executives and celebrities long speculated to be considering a run for president in 2020. The list has included Oprah Winfrey, Mark Cuban, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, Bob Iger of Disney and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. On other topics • Taxes: “We are robbing from the future of young people in America who ultimately are going to have to pay for a $21 trillion tax deficit,” Mr. Schultz said. • Real Estate: “Over the last few weeks, I have been in a number of U.S. cities and observed firsthand the abundance of empty storefronts across the country, in prime A1 locations. We are at a major inflection point as landlords across the country will be forced (sooner than later) to permanently lower rent rates to adjust to the ‘new norm,’” Mr. Schultz said. The tweet from Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle of Georgia, Delta’s home state, shows that it isn’t easy for companies to find a balance between those who want corporate America to push for more gun control and those who think conservatives are being unfairly maligned.

 SAN FRANCISCO —  The Nasdaq blasted through a record high on Friday as traders looking to ride recent momentum piled into Microsoft, Netflix, Amazon.com and other high-performance technology names. The rise came alongside a broad rally in the market. The S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose sharply - up 1.5 percent - as February's jobs report assuaged fears of inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes. The gains came nine years to the day since the bull market began. Microsoft, Apple and Amazon each rose more than 1 percent and hit or closely approached all-time highs, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index surged 1.8 percent to its own record. Those stock moves helped push the Nasdaq Composite Index up 1.4 percent to 7,532 points, which is about a third of a percent higher than its previous all-time high on Jan 26. Advertisement The Nasdaq and the S&P 500, also up about 1.4 percent, were both helped by employment data that tempered fears of faster interest rate increases. Advertisement There was no major news specifically related to the tech sector driving its gains. Netflix jumped 3.6 percent, also hitting a record high and bringing the video streaming service's gain in the past year to 65 percent. ""You look at tech and think, 'What is the catalyst that's going to bring it down?' I don't see one in the short term, and that makes me confident as a trader to go into those stocks that have been the leaders,"" said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC.  . Technology stocks have been widely viewed in recent months as a ""crowded trade,"" a situation where most investors have the same opinion, increasing the potential for a volatile selloff if sentiment changes. For example, Bank of Montreal in January launched an exchange traded fund aiming to triple the return of 10 stocks, including the so-called FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix Inc and Google parent Alphabet. Large cap active fund managers recently trimmed their relative weight in technology stocks to 1.18 times the broader market, down from 1.23 last month, giving up to discretionary stocks its position as the most crowded sector, according to a recent report from Bank of America. The Nasdaq is up 9 percent year to date, compared to a 3 percent increase in S&P 500, which has yet to recover from a February selloff sparked by fears of higher interest rates.

The robust hiring, reported by the Labor Department on Friday, was the strongest in 1½ years. ___ US bull market, 2nd longest since WWII, turns 9 NEW YORK (AP) — The bull market turned nine Friday, extending a run that began in the depths of the Great Recession. On March 9, 2009, the S&P 500 hit a cycle low of 676.53 and has more than quadrupled since. If the market continues on this trend until August 21, it will be the longest bull market in post-World War II history. ___ US stocks soar on strong jobs report; inflation fears ease NEW YORK (AP) — On the ninth anniversary of the bull market, Wall Street gets just what it wanted from the latest jobs report, and stocks and bond yields move sharply higher.

 Walmart has been making big investments in its online business as it tries to adapt to the shifting preferences of global shoppers and to keep pace with its rival Amazon. But Walmart’s online sales growth hit a speed bump in the company’s fiscal fourth quarter, which included the critical holiday shopping season. Online sales grew 23 percent in the United States during that three-month period, the company reported on Tuesday, less than half the rate of growth in each of the previous three quarters. Walmart’s chief executive, Doug McMillon, said “operational challenges” at the company’s fulfillment centers during the holidays were responsible for some of the slowdown. Walmart said that a large influx of electronics, toys and other seasonal items had made it difficult to fulfill sales of everyday products. Advertisement The slowdown reflects a broader challenge at Walmart, which has dominated the retail industry for decades with its extensive store network but is now playing catch-up in the e-commerce realm with Amazon, which captures half of all online spending. Advertisement “We are building a business,” Mr. McMillon said on a call with analysts on Tuesday. “We are learning something new.” Despite the slower pace of online growth, Walmart’s total sales increased 4.1 percent, to $136.3 billion, during the quarter, which ended Jan. 31. That was not enough to impress Wall Street. Walmart shares dropped nearly 9 percent in early morning trading. On a per-share basis, Walmart earned $1.33 in the fourth quarter, short of the $1.37 that analysts had expected. Operating income fell 28 percent, to $4.5 billion. Walmart has expanded its e-commerce offerings by purchasing Jet.com and the online clothing retailers Bonobos and Modcloth. Analysts have nonetheless questioned how Walmart plans to integrate the acquisitions into a cohesive online retail strategy.  . On Tuesday, the company said it would focus its broad push for new customers on Walmart.com and not Jet, a less-recognizable brand tailored to more urban, higher-income customers. Walmart spent $3.3 billion to acquire Jet in 2016. At the time, it was the largest deal ever for an e-commerce company, although it was not clear how the two brands would mesh. “Jet will go through adjustment, but it will grow again,” Mr. McMillon said on Tuesday. Walmart’s lagging growth online was not entirely unexpected given that the Jet acquisition was responsible for the large growth rates of previous quarters. But Mr. McMillon acknowledged that the fourth-quarter slowdown “was a bit more than we planned.” Advertisement To increase growth again — Walmart said it expected online sales to rise 40 percent over the next year — the company is accelerating its web-based grocery business, increasing the number of stores where customers can order food online and pick it up in stores. Walmart is also experimenting with home delivery in the United States and in Asia, where it recently signed a partnership with the Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten to deliver groceries. Still, finding ways to integrate Walmart’s stores with its e-commerce strategy is costly. Last week, Walmart announced that it would offer members of its Sam’s Club unit free shipping of online orders for an annual fee of $100. As part of that effort, Walmart said it would convert a Sam’s Club store in Memphis into an e-commerce distribution center and planned to open more such centers elsewhere in the United States in the coming year. The company closed a total of 63 Sam’s Club stores during the fourth quarter, affecting more than 9,000 workers. Walmart said that it would try to find new positions for as many of the employees as possible, but that some would probably end up out of work. The restructuring at Sam’s Club was among the factors that drove profits down for the quarter. Even without the restructuring and other one-time charges, the company said, operating income would have fallen for the quarter. We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. The telecom company had asked for internal communications between the White House and the Justice Department regarding AT&T’s $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner. Advertisement On Tuesday, a judge ruled that AT&T was not entitled to those documents, saying the companies had not “made a credible showing that they have been especially singled out.” Advertisement AT&T has argued that the Justice Department has unfairly singled out its proposed merger with Time Warner partly to stay in favor with the White House. President Trump has been a vocal critic of Time Warner’s news network, CNN, and said before the election that the deal should be stopped. The bigger picture Cecilia Kang of the NYT:  The decision puts a crimp in AT&T’s defense for its $85 billion proposed merger with Time Warner. And it is a big win for the Justice Department, which would like to avoid attention on the role of politics in its decision to stop the deal. The merger would transform the media landscape by combining a television and movie giant with one of the nation’s biggest media distributors. The trial is set to begin on March 19. For the first time, and after much protest, public companies must report their employees’ median pay and compare it with that of the chief executive. The Dodd-Frank Act, passed nearly eight years ago, required the disclosure, and firms are now disclosing it in proxy reports for 2017. Companies, lobbyists and some compensation experts spent years criticizing the rule, arguing that it revealed little about pay trends and was of little use to shareholders. The Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal-leaning think tank, on Tuesday noted that Honeywell was the first United States corporation to release the ratio. The company’s C.E.O., Darius Adamczyk, had a total pay package of $16.8 million in 2017, which was 333 times the pay of the median employee. The rule allows certain companies to exclude some foreign employees from the calculation of the ratio. Honeywell excluded workers from several countries where pay is most likely lower than in the United States. “The 333:1 ratio that Honeywell is reporting most likely would be even wider if Honeywell took all its workers into account,” the Institute said. — Peter Eavis A federal judge in Manhattan, in a brief order, rejected a motion filed by lawyers for Mr. Cohen and his firm, Point72 Asset Management, to temporarily seal a complaint filed last week by Lauren Bonner, an employee of the firm. Mr. Cohen’s lawyer had asked the judge to seal the lawsuit, which alleges the firm underpays female employees and fosters a hostile workplace for women, pending the resolution of another motion to push the matter into arbitration. Judge Analisa Torres of Federal District Court in Manhattan said the request to seal the entire complaint was “not narrowly tailored” and was inconsistent with the “presumption of public access” to court records. Lawyers for Mr. Cohen had sought to seal the order because it contained details of other employees’ compensation packages. The lawsuit also detailed a testosterone-fueled “boys’ club” atmosphere in which men commented frequently on women’s bodies and belittled their abilities. Advertisement — Matthew Goldstein Andrew writes: My latest column, on how banks and credit card companies could restrict support of gun sales in the wake of last week’s school shooting, has stirred up chatter in the business world. I’ve heard from people throughout corporate America overnight since it was published. Many said privately that they want to look at what they can do. More from the column: There is precedent for credit card issuers to ban the purchase of completely legal products. Just this month, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America banned the use of their cards to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. To be clear: Those three banks won’t let you use your credit card to buy Bitcoin, but they will happily let you use it to buy an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle — the same kind of gun used in mass shootings in Parkland; Newtown, Conn.; San Bernardino, Calif.; Las Vegas; and Sutherland Springs, Tex. Elsewhere in gun regulation: President Trump expressed some openness to tightening background checks. The United States Treasury Department is flooding the market with debt. On Tuesday, the government sold $179 billion worth of debt. Bloomberg reports: “Concerns about the U.S. borrowing cap had forced the Treasury to trim the total amount of bills it had outstanding, but that’s no longer a problem and the government is now busy ramping up issuance. Financing estimates from January show that the Treasury expects to issue $441 billion in net marketable debt in the current quarter and the bulk of that is likely to be in the short-term market.” That’s been a regular question since the tax overhaul was signed into law last year. Analysts at Goldman Sachs in a note over the weekend shed some light on the answer. • “Companies have pointed to a modest increase in investment as one destination for the incremental cash flow from tax reform. Consensus estimates for 2018 capex have increased by $17 billion (3 percent) since the passage of tax reform.” • Last month 39 S.&P. 500 companies increased their dividend, while for the first since 2012 no companies cut their payments. • Buying back shares remains a priority of companies, Goldman writes. Over the past 2 ½ months, S.&P. 500 firms have announced $171 billion of buybacks, $67 billion of which has come this year, a 22% increase from the same period in 2017. In the same note, Goldman also took a closer look at this earnings season. By many measures, corporate earnings are the strongest they have been in the past decade. Goldman points out: • Companies in the S.&P. 500 are set to report that profit grew 15 percent last quarter. That’s the fastest pace since 2011. Advertisement • The percentage of companies beating estimates is at its highest level since 2010. The percentage beating sales forecast is at its highest since 2004. But the stock reaction to S.&P. 500 companies either beating or missing expectations “has been muted relative to history.” The reason? Investors are more focused on tax reform and earnings forecasts for 2018, Goldman writes. Analysts have raised their 2018 earnings estimates for companies in the S.&P. 500 by 7 percent so far this year. Some context Higher profit margins because of the lower corporate tax rate are driving much of the increase in this year’s earnings forecast. A point that becomes clearer by looking at 2018 sales estimates. Analysts have increased their revenue forecasts by only one percentage point and much of that increase comes from higher oil prices boosting forecasts for energy companies. Remember when the company said that it was changing its name from Long Island Iced Tea and shift its corporate focus to virtual currencies? Well, new developments have come up: • Long Blockchain has named a new C.E.O., Shamyl Malik. • It plans to spin off its beverage division into the publicly traded Long Island Brand Beverages by June 30, and the company’s last C.E.O., Philip Thomas, will be on the new business’ board. • And last week, Nasdaq informed Long Blockchain that it planned to delist the company because its stock price had traded too low. Long Blockchain’s market cap as of this morning was $31.9 million, below Nasdaq’s threshold, after shares in the company tumbled amid the great crypto crash of early 2018. The company is appealing. — Michael de la Merced Here’s why the company’s shares are down 10percent — their biggest fall since 2015 — after its fourth-quarter earnings report: • The company earned $1.33 a share, while analysts had expected $1.37. • Operating income fell 28 percent, to $4.5 billion, thanks to charges tied to the closing of Sam’s Club stores. Advertisement • E-commerce sales rose 23 percent during the quarter, a slower pace than in previous quarters. • Full-year sales growth expectations went down by close to half, to 1.5 percent to 2 percent, in part because of Sam’s Club and a curb on the sales of tobacco products. What the company’s chief, Doug McMillon, said: “We’re making real progress putting our unique assets to work to serve customers in all the ways they want to shop.” — Michael de la Merced Days after Rob Goldman, its vice president of advertising, tried to clear up misconceptions about the company’s role in the 2016 presidential election, Facebook still finds itself in hot water. President Trump took the tweets as proof that Russia didn’t try to help him win, while critics said they contradicted Robert Mueller’s indictment. Mr. Goldman apologized in an internal Facebook post. But his tweets — which contained inaccuracies — suggested that Facebook executives still don’t understand how central the company was to Russia’s misinformation campaign, according to Nicholas Thomson of Wired. More from Kevin Roose of the NYT: In real-world terms, a part of Facebook still sees itself as the bank that got robbed, rather than the architect who designed a bank with no safes, and no alarms or locks on the doors, and then acted surprised when burglars struck.

Broadcom has said a higher NXP bid would be a deal-breaker (as of this morning, however, Michael hears that it isn’t clear whether it will walk away). The new offer may have come at an opportune time: I.S.S., the influential proxy adviser, recommended that Qualcomm shareholders vote for four of Broadcom’s six board nominees. (But that too falls short of Broadcom’s goals. The company’s C.E.O., Hock Tan, has said he would walk away if the entire slate wasn’t elected.) A question: Elliott Management, which campaigned against the $110-a-share offer, is on board with the new one. But will Qualcomm’s shareholders accept paying more for NXP?

T5,26-Feb-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin FEB. 26, 2018
  Good Monday. Here’s what we’re watching: • We’ve been parsing Warren Buffett’s annual letter to shareholders. • Stock investors beware: Inflation could soon jump. • Broadcom moves closer to striking a deal with Qualcomm, but the two remain far apart on price. • The Weinstein Company will file for bankruptcy. • Fidelity is rethinking its stock-picker system. • Businesses are reconsidering their relationships with the gun industry. • United Parcel Service has sued the European Commission after it blocked a 2013 deal for the Dutch delivery company TNT Express, which was later bought by its shipping rival FedEx. Advertisement Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Warren Buffett's annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders, released on Saturday, showed that the company had substantially increased its holdings of Apple stock. Advertisement The wager has done pretty well already. Berkshire Hathaway started gobbling up Apple stock just over a year ago. At the end of last year, its Apple position had a market value of $28.2 billion, according to the letter. The position cost Berkshire $21 billion, the letter said, which suggests a gain of $7.2 billion, or over 30 percent. The bet also outperformed a soaring stock market. In the past 12 months, Apple stock is up 31 percent, versus 17 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 index. What do the numbers say now? Apple, by some metrics, looks cheap. Its price-to-earnings ratio, a valuation yardstick that compares a company’s per-share profits to its stock price, is 15.5 times forecasted earnings for 2018. Facebook’s stock is at 26 times, Google is at 27 times, and Amazon is at a dizzying 184 times. Apple’s ratio is even smaller than the overall market’s. The bullish theory: Apple’s stock price will keep rising as investors come to see that it is undervalued. But shouldn’t investors have realized this years ago? Apple, after all, is a famous company, and investors have long been aware of its fat profit margins, its grip on consumers and its ability to generate billions of dollars of cash flow. But Apple is unimpressive in a way that often worries investors: It is a slower growing company. Google, Facebook and Amazon are all expected to increase their sales at a significantly faster clip than the 10 percent that Apple achieved in 2017. It would take a large number of additional iPhone sales, at higher prices, for Apple to have the sales growth of Google. And for premium priced products in a saturated market, generating higher sales can be tough, as weak demand for Apple’s iPhone X shows. Could investors become more bullish? It’s hard to know exactly why investors become willing to pay a lot more for certain companies. Amazon’s share price is up over 160 percent over the past two years, a period when business was strong, but not markedly stronger than investors expected. Sometimes the herd just changes its mind. And there are plenty of ways in which Apple excels. Speaking to CNBC on Monday, Mr. Buffett enthused about one. Once consumers own, say, an iPhone, they have a tendency to stay loyal to Apple products. “You are very, very, very locked in, at least psychologically and mentally, to the product you are using,” he said. — Peter Eavis With the stock market regaining much of the ground it lost after its steep sell-off earlier this month, it might seem like investors are done worrying about higher inflation. They may want to keep fretting, though. James W. Paulsen, a stock market strategist at the Leuthold Group, put out some new research on Monday that suggests that the inflation rate, 2.1 percent in January, could move a lot higher in coming months. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York calculate a metric that draws on both economic and financial data to try and assess the amount of inflation that is brewing in the economy. One version of the New York Fed’s “underlying inflation gauge” rose by 3 percent in January. Mr. Paulsen took historical data for this yardstick and found that, in the past, it was quite a good predictor of actual inflation. “Although not perfect and while the lead/lag relationship varies over time, the underlying inflation gauge has done a good job of forecasting future movements in the core inflation rate during the next 18 months,” he wrote. If this relationship holds up, inflation could be 2.6 percent by the end of this year, and 3 percent by the middle of 2019, Mr. Paulsen wrote. Of course, the relationship might break down in the near future. Advertisement Higher inflation would lead to higher bond yields (bond investors require a larger payout to protect themselves against inflation.) In turn, the higher bond yields would make stocks look more expensive (why pay up for stocks when bond payments are increasing in value?) As a result, stocks could sell off, if the yields on bellwether bonds like the 10-year Treasury note keeps spiking. On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 2.86 percent, from 2.87 percent on Friday. Stocks moved higher. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index closed up 1.2 percent and is now just 3.2 percent off the high it reached just before its plunge at the start of this month. — Peter Eavis But the two remain far apart on price. On Monday, Qualcomm’s board in a letter to Hock Tan, Broadcom’s chief executive, said the two sides have made progress addressing Qualcomm’s regulatory concerns and proposed the two companies hold a meeting that focuses on negotiating the price. From the statement accompanying the letter: The Qualcomm Board believes the meeting led to further progress toward a possible negotiated transaction on key issues other than price. The Board authorized providing Broadcom with a mark-up of Broadcom’s previously released draft merger agreement that, if agreed to by Broadcom, would resolve all issues between the two companies other than price. But Broadcom reiterated in the February 23 meeting that its reduced $79.00 per share proposal is its best and final proposal. The Qualcomm Board is unanimous in its view that each of Broadcom’s proposals, including its prior $82.00 per share proposal, materially undervalues Qualcomm, and the Board encourages Broadcom to enter into mutual due diligence and price negotiations. So what price is Qualcomm pushing for? The FT reports that “Qualcomm is insisting that Broadcom raises its offer by at least 15 percent to above $90 per share, up from its current $79 per share bid.” Republican politicians in Georgia, where Delta Air Lines is headquartered, are hitting back at the company, reports Leslie Josephs of CNBC. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle tweeted: 
            I will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA. Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back.         Rick Jeffares, a candidate for lieutenant governor and former Georgia state senator, weighed in with: 
            I stand with the NRA & support our 2nd Amendment rights. Delta Airlines is now seeking $40 MILLION TAX BREAK from the GA Legislature. I'm leading the charge to let Delta know their attack on the NRA and our 2nd Amendment is unacceptable. #StandWithJeffareshttps://t.co/YQ16VcGch2 pic.twitter.com/1x256htX9u  Writes Ms. Josephs: After its tweet announcing the end of the NRA discounts, Delta said in a statement that the “decision reflects the airline’s neutral status in the current national debate over gun control amid recent school shootings” and that it was taken “out of respect for our customers and employees on both sides.” The airline added that “it continues to support the Second Amendment.” He certainly sees the need. In his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders, Mr. Buffett said: Berkshire’s goal is to substantially increase the earnings of its non-insurance group. For that to happen, we will need to make one or more huge acquisitions. We certainly have the resources to do so. At year end Berkshire held $116.0 billion in cash. But will he have the opportunity? Mr. Buffett bemoaned the sky-high purchase prices that “proved a barrier to virtually all deals we reviewed in 2017.” Critics’ corner • Tara Lachapelle of Bloomberg Gadfly writes: “The best way Buffett can solidify his legacy is by returning to the M&A market with the same force and determination he’s always shown. He may need to pay more than he wants to, but what’s a little extra to Berkshire in the long run?” • Mr. Buffett is on the wrong side of a generational shift, writes John Foley in Breakingviews. In contrast, BlackRock and Vanguard have waded in and called for companies to do good. That attitude is already baked into the Buffett view, Mr. Foley writes, “But notions of what’s now referred to as ESG — environmental, social and governance factors — are otherwise fuzzy in Berkshire’s universe.” Advertisement Other highlights from the letter • Berkshire’s windfall of $29.6 billion from the U.S. tax overhaul was only slightly offset by $1.4 billion of tax payments on repatriated earnings. Mr. Buffett did not expand on his recent criticisms of tax cuts. Read more about what he did focus on here. • Mr. Buffett railed against a new accounting rule that will affect future quarterly and annual reports. The change requires companies to include in earnings the gains and losses on stocks they hold but have not sold. Because Berkshire holds $170 billion of stocks, the impact on Berkshire’s bottom line could be significant. Peter Eavis of The Times notes: It would indeed be notable if Berkshire started to publish “adjusted earnings,” or financial statements that exclude certain items. In last year’s annual report, Mr. Buffett criticized companies that publish adjusted earnings that leave out costs like stock awards to executives. At the annual meeting on May 5, a shareholder may want to ask why shareholders should be asked to overlook losses on stocks. Related Michael Kives, a longtime Hollywood agent at Creative Artists Agency who has consulted and represented Mr. Buffett — as well as Mikhail Gorbachev, Katy Perry and Jessica Alba, among others — is striking out on his own with a new firm, K5. It will provide advisory services for companies “across media, sports, technology, finance, politics, and a variety of other industries,” according to an announcement expected to go out later today. United Parcel Service has sued European antitrust regulators for a decision they made five years ago that blocked its takeover of the Dutch delivery company TNT Express, according to a record of court proceedings published on Monday. U.P.S. had pursued the TNT merger in the hope of gaining a larger presence in Europe and in emerging markets, but European officials rejected it because of concerns that the transaction would decrease competition and increase prices. The General Court of the European Union annulled the decision by European Commission regulators last year, in part because the commission had used different economic models at different times to evaluate the deal. The commission, the executive arm of the European Union, has appealed that ruling to Europe’s highest court. Facing a deadline to seek damages, U.P.S. filed a claim in December seeking 1.74 billion euros, or about $2.14 billion, plus interest, according to a notice published on Monday. U.P.S. is also seeking court costs and compensation for any taxes it may have to pay on the damage amount. U.P.S. agreed to acquire TNT in a transaction valued at $6.8 billion in March 2012, but European regulators said they would block the deal because they were worried that a merger would effectively leave the Continent’s shipping market with just two main players: U.P.S. and DHL. U.P.S. withdrew its offer in January 2013. Advertisement A shipping rival, FedEx Corporation, agreed to acquire TNT in a $4.8 billion deal in 2015, completing the deal after receiving approval from European regulators the next year. — Chad Bray Talks about a sale to a group led by Maria Contreras-Sweet have collapsed. The group had offered to pay about $275 million for the company, plus the assumption of $225 million in debt. The Weinstein board blamed Ms. Contreras-Sweet and one of her primary backers, Ron Burkle. “Late last night, you returned to us an incomplete document that unfortunately does not keep your promises,” it said in a letter. “That is regrettable, but not in our power to change.” The board, which includes Bob Weinstein, accused Ms. Contreras-Sweet’s team of failing to provide funding to keep the studio operating while the deal was completed and said she had proposed new sale conditions that meant the transaction would take much longer to close.

Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . The context  The change comes after an outside review of behavior within the stock-picking unit and reports of sexual harassment allegations. More from the WSJ’s Sarah Krouse and Kirsten Grind: Stock picking has been under unprecedented pressure in recent years as investors have poured money into low-cost index-tracking funds. The star-manager system helped fuel careers of top fund managers at the family-run firm, but it also created a system in which portfolio managers wielded outsize power over analysts, more than a dozen current and former employees said. Blackstone asked outside fund managers to detail their ownership in companies that make or sell guns by Sunday evening, according to unnamed sources that spoke to the WSJ. Bank of America said it was examining its relationship with the weapons industry, too.

Many have watched warily as Mr. Xi has used his power to imprison scores of dissidents, stifle free speech and tighten oversight of the economy, the world’s second largest.

 NEW YORK —  Walmart wants a bigger slice of the crowded meal kits business, announcing Monday that it will offer easy-to-make dinners in more stores this year. The move puts the world's largest retailer in direct competition with meal-kit companies such as Blue Apron and HelloFresh, which deliver boxes of raw meat and chopped vegetables to subscribers' doorsteps. After Walmart's announcement Monday, Blue Apron's stock tumbled 5 percent. Walmart said its meal kits, which will expand from 250 stores to more than 2,000, will be available in its deli section or can be ordered online and picked up later that day. It is offering three types of kits: pre-portioned meals that need to be cooked; ingredients that pair with its rotisserie chicken; or one-step dishes that just need to be heated up. The meals feed two people and are priced between $8 and $15. Several companies already offer meal kits, both online and in stores. Amazon, which bought grocer Whole Foods last year, sells meal kits on its site and at its recently-opened convenience store in Seattle. Albertsons Cos., the owner of Safeway, Carrs and other supermarkets, bought online meal-kit service Plated last year to sell the kits at its 2,300 stores. Blue Apron Holdings Inc., meanwhile, has struggled since it became a publicly-traded company in June; it recently said it lost 15 percent of its customers last year compared with the year before. Its shares are down 74 percent since its initial public offering price of $10. Walmart Inc., based in Bentonville, Arkansas, said its meal kits will be made in stores. Its dishes will include meatloaf, spaghetti and meatballs and chicken fried rice. We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.

 NEW YORK — U.S. stocks rallied on Monday as fears of a global trade war ebbed with investors betting that U.S. President Donald Trump would back down on his threat to impose hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Strategists also cited rising oil prices and ebbing concerns after an Italian election for a relief rally in the three major U.S. equity indexes. Investors started to eye Trump's threat as a negotiating tool after he tweeted that Canada and Mexico could avoid his proposed tariffs if they ceded ground in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) talks. A lack of specific retaliatory measures from other countries was also reassuring, said Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist, Allianz Global Investors in New York. Advertisement ""It felt like (Trump) revealed some of his cards with that Twitter comment.

 Shane Smith is preparing to cede his position as Vice Media’s chief executive officer to Nancy Dubuc, who announced on Monday that she was stepping down as chief executive of A&E Networks, according to people briefed on the matter. Mr. Smith, 48, is expected to remain at Vice Media — potentially as its chairman, said one of the people, who requested anonymity because the moves were not yet final. Ms. Dubuc, 49, was in talks to take on the chief executive job after she leaves A&E Networks, the television group owned by Hearst and Disney, the people said. Ms. Dubuc has built close ties with Vice since A&E Networks invested $250 million in the company in 2014. Ms. Dubuc, who serves on the board of Vice and is known to be close with Mr. Smith, oversaw the joint venture that started the Viceland TV network in 2016. In recent years, Mr. Smith emerged not only as the face of Vice but as the media mogul for the digital age. The combination of a brash maverick and a consummate salesman, Mr. Smith helped transform Vice from a freebie punk magazine started in Montreal in 1994 into a global company with about 3,000 employees, a TV network, a digital outlet, a film-production company and programs on HBO. Vice is backed by corporate giants like Disney and Fox. Advertisement But there was a dark side to that ascent. In December, a New York Times investigation detailed the mistreatment of women at the company and found four settlements involving allegations of sexual harassment or defamation against Vice employees. In addition, more than two dozen women said they had experienced or witnessed sexual misconduct at the company, including unwanted kisses, groping, lewd remarks and propositions for sex. Advertisement In response to the article, Mr. Smith and Suroosh Alvi, who founded Vice Media with Mr. Smith, said in a statement that “from the top down, we have failed as a company to create a safe and inclusive workplace where everyone, especially women, can feel respected and thrive.” They said that a “boys club” culture at Vice had “fostered inappropriate behavior that permeated throughout the company” and pledged a number of changes, including pay parity by the end of 2018. Since then, Vice’s leadership has been in turmoil. Its chief digital officer, Mike Germano, left the company after it looked into harassment allegations against him. The company’s president, Andrew Creighton, has been on leave while the board reviews a $135,000 settlement involving sexual harassment allegations against him from a former employee. And in February, a former employee sued the company, claiming that it had marginalized women and systematically discriminated against them by paying men substantially more for similar work. News that Ms. Dubuc was in talks to take on the chief executive job at Vice was first reported by Variety.  Her future has been the subject of intense speculation in the media industry over the past two months.  . Ms. Dubuc was a finalist for the top job at Amazon Studios, a position that ultimately went to the NBC executive Jennifer Salke (Ms. Salke started at Amazon on Monday). Around the time that Ms. Salke was offered the job last month, a person close to Ms. Dubuc said that she had grown weary of the extended interview process and removed herself from the proceedings with the plan of signing a contract that was waiting for her at A&E Networks, which counts A&E, History and Lifetime among its stations. Her return seemed like a settled matter. Even in the chatty confines of the media business, few people foresaw that the top Vice job would be in Ms. Dubuc’s future. Ms. Dubuc and Ms. Salke are prominent female media executives who have made huge moves in recent months, at a time when female leadership is at a premium. The Fox TV group co-chief executive, Dana Walden, has a contract that is expiring this summer, and her next move is also being watched with keen interest within the entertainment industry. Advertisement Ms. Dubuc plans to step down from her post at A&E on April 16. Abbe Raven, a longtime A&E executive who retired from the company in 2015, will lead the company until a replacement is found, Hearst and Disney said in a statement announcing Ms. Dubuc’s departure. In the statement, Ms. Dubuc said that she had called A&E Networks home for nearly 20 years and was ready for a new challenge. “Anyone who knows me well knows I am an entrepreneur, creator, rebel and disruptor at heart,” she said. “I have a famous neon sign in my office that blares ‘Who dares wins.’ After 20 years at A&E, the hardest thing will be to leave the people and company I love. But, as a creative executive and leader, and to stay true to my personal mantra, I need my next dare and my next challenge.” John Koblin contributed reporting.

 ___ Bids to curb health care costs offer little more than talk WASHINGTON (AP) — What began as bipartisan attempt to curb soaring health care premiums in the nation's health insurance markets is faltering in Congress. At fault are escalating demands from each party and erratic positions by President Donald Trump. Democrats want bigger federal subsidies for consumers under President Barack Obama's health care law. Republicans aim to relax its coverage requirements and win abortion restrictions. The bickering could collapse the whole effort, with each side blaming the other. ___ Trump says commerce secretary will talk tariffs with EU WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump says his commerce secretary will be talking to the European Union about tariffs that he argues have been unfair to the United States. Writing on Twitter, Trump says Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will speak with EU representatives about ""eliminating the large Tariffs and Barriers they use against the U.S.A."" The president announced last week that the United States would impose heavy tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, with some countries potentially exempted. ___ Get Started: Can't pay the IRS? You do have options NEW YORK (AP) — With a little more than five weeks until this year's tax filing deadline of April 17, many small business owners are tussling with the question, how am I going to pay my taxes? When owners haven't set aside enough money to cover their taxes, they do have options, including using savings, borrowing money or working out a payment plan with the IRS. But not filing a return because you can't pay isn't one of them. The IRS levies hefty penalties when a tax return is filed after the deadline. ___ Apple adds more 'Texture' to its services with magazine deal SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple has bought digital magazine distributor Texture to extend its subscription services beyond music and online storage. The deal announced Monday puts Apple in control of a service that is often described as a Netflix of magazines. Texture offers readers access to articles in more than 200 magazines for $10 per month, much like Netflix sells unlimited access to its video programming. Apple didn't disclose the price it is paying for Texture. Advertisement ___ Goldman Sachs CEO succession clearer with Schwartz retiring NEW YORK (AP) — Harvey Schwartz, a top executive at Goldman Sachs, is retiring next month, clearing the way for David Solomon to eventually become the next chief executive of the Wall Street firm. Schwartz and Solomon jointly hold the positions of co-chief operating officer and president. Both had been considered likely successors to Lloyd Blankfein, the current CEO. Advertisement ___ House Democrat seeks data on Trump firm donation to Treasury WASHINGTON (AP) — A senior House Democrat is asking the Trump Organization and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to provide more information on a $151,470 donation the Trump family firm turned over to the government. President Donald Trump pledged last year to donate profits from foreign government patronage at his company's properties. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., asked a Trump Organization lawyer to provide documents on the company's foreign government payments and how it calculated its donation.  . ___ China shrinks steel industry slowly, drawing Western ire BEIJING (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump's blanket tariff hike on steel and aluminum reflects American ire over a flood of low-cost exports from China, whose steel output accounts for half the world's supply. The industry swelled over the past decade to support a history-making Chinese construction boom. China has closed some steel mills but is moving too gradually to defuse American and European anger at a flood of low-cost exports. ___ US budget deficit jumped to $215.2 billion in February WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal government recorded a budget deficit of $215.2 billion in February, up significantly from a year ago as the impact of the GOP tax cuts passed in December begin to surface. The Treasury Department reports that the February deficit was 12.1 percent higher than a year ago, reflecting in part a drop of $5 billion in individual withholding taxes paid last month compared to a year ago. ___ Tech gains but industrials slide, leaving indexes mixed NEW YORK (AP) — Technology companies continue to rally Monday while industrial companies slump, leaving stock indexes mixed at the close of trading. The tech industry has led the market's recovery from its recent lows while industrials were coming off a big gain Friday. Retailers including Amazon and Starbucks also made gains. ___ The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 3.55 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,783.02. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 157.13 points, or 0.6 percent, to 25,178.61. The Nasdaq composite finished at another record high after it added 27.51 points, or 0.4 percent, to 7,588.32. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks rose 3.91 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,601.06. Benchmark U.S. crude declined 68 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $61.36 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed 54 cents to $64.95 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline lost 1 cent to $1.89 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.86 a gallon.

T3,2-Mar-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin MARCH 2, 2018
 Good Friday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Would a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal really shift the 5G race? • Mrs. May’s reasonableness may not win over Europe. • Has Gary Cohn reached a breaking point? • The silver linings in President Trump’s tariff plans. • The questions BlackRock is asking gun makers. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Lawmakers have pressed the government panel that scrutinizes deals for national security concerns — known as Cfius — to take a close look at Broadcom’s hostile bid for its fellow chip maker, which includes a proxy fight to gain a majority of Qualcomm’s board seats. (The shareholder vote is scheduled for Tuesday.) Advertisement Most notable among them is Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, whose letter to Cfius raises two issues: • Whether foreign companies like Singapore’s Broadcom can gain control of American counterparts through proxy fights Advertisement • Concern that Broadcom would sell off parts of Qualcomm to win regulatory approval, disrupting the work of the main American developer of 5G wireless technology — and therefore ceding the race for a superfast internet to China The WSJ recently reported that members of Cfius have been examining the former point. It’s an interesting issue since the panel generally doesn’t get involved until a potential transaction has been submitted to it for review, and obviously, there’s nothing of the sort yet. Some officials pointed out that the panel has the jurisdiction to consider board takeovers as a form of foreign acquisition, though the article said that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin isn’t sold yet on the argument. But let’s consider the second point. The WSJ reported that some Cfius members share Mr. Cornyn’s concerns about a weakened or distracted Qualcomm falling behind Huawei of China in the 5G contest. But that ignores Qualcomm’s very public collaboration with Chinese tech companies on 5G. The American chip maker said in January that it has shared information on some of its hardware with Lenovo, Xiaomi and other Chinese companies. And last week, Qualcomm and Huawei announced that they have jointly conducted significant tests for a 5G standard. Here’s what Serge Wilenegger, a Qualcomm Wireless executive, said in the news release: “As the industry works toward the goal of commercial launches of 5G NR products and networks in 2019, close collaboration among global mobile industry leaders is necessary to validate the technologies and continue to build and improve our capabilities.” The research analyst Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein isn’t convinced by Mr. Cornyn’s point either, arguing in an investor note that Intel can also play a role in developing 5G tech and that, more importantly, Broadcom itself is very interested in the wireless standard. Broadcom has a reputation for being a cost-cutter, which Qualcomm has argued would likely stunt its ability to keep innovating. That question hasn’t been settled. But the question of whether a deal would endanger the U.S.’s role in the 5G race appears to go a bit too far. A related consideration: Cfius’s ability to review Broadcom’s moves depends on that chip maker being considered a foreign company. But shareholders of the manufacturer are scheduled to vote on moving its legal residence to the U.S. from Singapore on May 6. It’s unclear whether the panel will act before then — or if it would ultimately have to decide that it has no jurisdiction after that change in address. Advertisement — Michael de la Merced President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs are unlikely to amount to effective policymaking. They target stanch allies and ignore far greater problems in the world trading system. But there may something to salvage from the wreckage. First, on the face of it, the president seems willing to risk a stock market plunge to pursue a policy that Wall Street opposes. Too often, the disfavor of investors is taken as evidence that a policy is terrible when it might be just inconvenient to powerful interests. Second, Mr. Trump’s tariffs have kept an important debate over trade going. One hope for Mr. Trump’s administration is that its skepticism toward free trade leads to policies that help workers whose jobs are vulnerable to free trade. The proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum are unlikely to provide longer-term assistance to workers in those industries. Still, the skepticism toward free trade may now be permanent and provide future administrations with greater leeway to address its drawbacks. — Peter Eavis Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday described the highly preferential relationship her government is seeking to establish with the European Union after it leaves the bloc next year. And to win over skeptics, she attempted to make Britain’s goals seem as reasonable as possible. Her requests for a unique relationship will no doubt get short shrift from those who say Britain cannot be allowed to enjoy the benefits of trading with Europe without accepting most of the obligations. Mrs. May’s response is that both sides can benefit under a new arrangement. She said: We both want good access to each other’s markets; we want competition between us to be fair and open; and we want reliable, transparent means of verifying we are meeting our commitments and resolving disputes. But what is clear is that for us both to meet our objectives we need to look beyond the precedents, and find a new balance. And Mrs. May said Britain would not, as some fear, reduce regulation to win business from the European Union and still expect a high degree of access to the bloc’s markets. She said: But in practice we are unlikely to want to reduce our standards: not least because the British public would rightly punish any government that did so at the ballot box. The big questions: Will the European Union be willing to set up a whole new regulatory infrastructure to oversee a stand-alone trading arrangement with Britain? Why would the bloc go to such lengths when it has the clout to insist that Britain abides by its rules? What would Britain do if the European Union says no to most of what’s in Mrs. May’s speech? It would almost certainly deepen tensions within the British government between those who want a deeply entwined trading relationship with Europe and those who favor a looser one. Mrs. May, who has spent weeks trying to build a consensus in her cabinet, may then find it even harder to present a coherent position to the European Union, giving it even less reason to want to compromise. — Peter Eavis President Trump’s national economic adviser has threatened to quit before, most notably in the wake of the controversy over the violence in Charlottesville, Va. But now that Mr. Cohn apparently has been outplayed in the battle over trade, will he finally decide to depart? The former Goldman Sachs president had managed to hold off trade hard-liners like the policy adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross during previous debates on tariffs. But an exodus of like-minded White House officials diminished Mr. Cohn’s standing — and let his rivals reassert their positions. Advertisement From Damian Paletta and Josh Dawsey of the WaPo: “Gary got rolled and was entirely kept in the dark,” a person close to the White House said of Trump’s top economic adviser. Or as Mike Allen and Jonathan Swan of Axios put it: The tariffs call was also a big middle finger to economic adviser Gary Cohn, who has fought for more than one year to kill tariffs that would provoke a trade war or higher prices for consumers, a de facto tax increase. Our colleagues Mark Landler and Maggie Haberman have reported that Mr. Cohn threatened to resign if the president followed through on the tariff threat. (That cost him standing with Mr. Trump, though he seemed to regain much of his political capital, particularly after the passage of the tax overhaul.) Mr. Landler and Ms. Haberman point out that Mr. Cohn is still waiting to see if Mr. Trump actually rolls out the tariffs — a fair question, given how quickly his boss appears to switch policy positions. But if the White House does impose tariffs on imported aluminum and steel, will Mr. Cohn finally pull the trigger? On a related note, let’s talk about the resuscitation of Mr. Ross’s political fortunes: • Axios, on Jan. 21: “President Donald Trump has put Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross out to pasture,” the publication reported, noting that Mr. Ross had been criticized for falling asleep in meetings. • Axios, today: “White House staff, most of whom were in the dark about Trump’s planned tariffs announcement, are referring to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, the victor in the policy coup, as ‘Chief Ross.’” — Michael de la Merced Expect today to be rough in the markets, after President Trump doubled down this morning on his threat to impose tariffs on international steel and aluminum. S. & P. 500 futures are down in premarket trading, after falling yesterday. 
            When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore-we win big. It’s easy!         
            We must protect our country and our workers. Our steel industry is in bad shape. IF YOU DON’T HAVE STEEL, YOU DON’T HAVE A COUNTRY!         
            When a country Taxes our products coming in at, say, 50%, and we Tax the same product coming into our country at ZERO, not fair or smart. We will soon be starting RECIPROCAL TAXES so that we will charge the same thing as they charge us. $800 Billion Trade Deficit-have no choice!         The current plan: A 25 percent tariff on steel and a 10 percent one on aluminum. The winners: U.S. sellers of industrial metals, like AK Steel and U.S. Steel, whose stocks jumped yesterday; trade hard-liners like Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, Robert Lighthizer, the White House’s top trade negotiator, and Peter Navarro, its trade policy guru. The losers: Big metal consumers like Ford, G.M., Boeing and United Technologies; free-trade proponents like Gary Cohn, who has threatened to resign; many Republican lawmakers; Brazil; and Canada. Advertisement The world’s response: China could retaliate with tariffs on some U.S. goods. The E.U. could, too. Japan and Korea are hoping that, as allies, they would be exempted — but they appear prepared to fight back. The context: George W. Bush imposed tariffs on imported steel in 2002. He lifted them a year later. Peter Eavis’s take: Mr. Trump’s tariffs may be quite narrow in focus and exist for a relatively short period. Investors could learn to live with those. But the U.S. economy and stock markets have some vulnerabilities that could magnify the damage from a trade war. Goldman Sachs’s economists wrote that while the potential tariff’s on imported steel and aluminum “could alleviate political pressure on the White House to pursue other trade restrictions in the near-term,” it would increase “the probability of trade-restrictive outcomes to other pending issues.” On Nafta: “We believe the most likely outcome in the near-term is the announcement of a few small agreements on technical trade issues, but we continue to expect negotiations to stall on major issues like rules of origin and government procurement. There is a good chance that this could eventually lead the President to announce he intends to withdraw from NAFTA, but such an announcement does not appear likely in the near term, in our view.” On China’s practices regarding intellectual property and technology transfer: “We expect that the Administration will ultimately announce restrictions on investment by Chinese companies in the US, and possibly broader trade restrictions, in response to its ongoing Section 301 investigation. The deadline for that decision is not until August, however, and it is not clear when an announcement in this area will be made.” The Commerce Secretary appeared on CNBC and downplayed the impact of President Trump’s planned tariffs, using a can of Campbell Soup. “In a can of Campbell Soup, there are about 2.6 pennies worth of steel. So if that goes up by 25 percent, that’s about six-tenths of one cent on the price on a can of Campbell Soup,” Ross argued. “I just bought this can today at a 7-Eleven ... and it priced at a $1.99. Who in the world is going to be too bothered?” Not everyone agrees with that view: 
            Like most brewers, we are selling an increasing amount of our beers in aluminum cans, and this action will cause aluminum prices to rise. It is likely to lead to job losses across the beer industry. (2/3)         BlackRock, the largest investor in the world, is doubling down on pushing gun makers to consider their responsibilities to the public. BlackRock said that in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., shootings it has been speaking with public gun manufacturers and retailers. “For manufacturers and retailers of civilian firearms, we believe that responsible policies and practices are critical to their long-term prospects.

We have already had constructive discussions with some, and we are continuing to pursue our engagement with them all.” Blackrock said it is asking companies to answer questions like: • “What is your strategy and process for managing the reputational, financial and litigation risk associated with manufacturing civilian firearms?” • “How do you assess the financial, reputational and litigation risk of the various aspects of your product lines and how each of those products is distributed?” — Andrew Ross Sorkin An article in The Intercept says that not only did the real estate firm — which Jared Kushner led until joining the White House — try to convince Qatar to invest in its embattled 666 Fifth Avenue property in Manhattan, but that it spoke directly with the emirate’s top money man. Advertisement The meeting between Charles Kushner, Mr. Kushner’s father, and Ali Sharif Al Emadi of Qatar was last April, a month before Saudi Arabia and others set up a blockade of the emirate. Mr. Kushner supported the move, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson did not. More from Clayton Swisher and Ryan Grim of The Intercept: The 30-minute meeting, according to two sources in the financial industry who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the potential transaction, included aides to both parties, and was held at a suite at the St. Regis Hotel in New York. A follow-up meeting was held the next day in a glass-walled conference room at the Kushner property itself, though Al Emadi did not attend the second gathering in person. A Kushner Companies spokeswoman said that the company doesn’t “do business with any sovereign funds.” The context: Mr. Kushner’s family business has appeared to become more of a liability to his work in the White House. Remember that he held meetings with top financiers whose firms later lent money to Kushner Companies, which has aroused concerns. Or that several countries have reportedly discussed using his complicated financial ties as negotiating leverage over him. — Michael de la Merced Mr. Trump has long thrived on chaos as an organizing principle. But how much disorder is too much? Remember that the White House has suffered from: very public infighting; off-the-cuff policy proposals by the president; a historically high 34 percent turnover rate; officials threatening to quit to win policy arguments; and an array of investigations into advisers (including Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka) and cabinet members. Jim Stewart spoke with a number of experts for their takes on how the president has been running his White House. Here’s a taster: • Jeffrey Pfeffer of Stanford University, said of the White House’s turnover rate, “This reflects badly on his leadership.” Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . • Charles Elson of the University of Delaware said, “He isn’t bound by any traditional norms of management.” Here’s what the Federal Reserve chairman told the Senate Banking Committee: “Nothing is suggesting to me that wage inflation is at a point of accelerating. I would expect that some continued strengthening in the labor market can take place without causing inflation.” Advertisement But new data from the Commerce Department suggest the opposite: • Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE, rose 0.4 percent, the biggest increase since September. • So-called core PCE, which excludes food and energy, advanced 0.3 percent in January — the largest gain since January 2017. • Year-over-year core PCE, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, rose 1.5 percent in January.

(Bloomberg) Facebook has drawn criticism for inconsistencies regarding which body images are allowed in ads on its platform: a man’s bare chest was found acceptable, but a woman’s bare back was not. (The company later said the latter should have been.) Advertisement More from Sapna Maheshwari and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT: The company has flagged a photo of a woman in a T-shirt reading in dim lighting, for example, while allowing a provocative image of a man’s bare stomach for an ad from a Facebook group dedicated to “steamy romance novels” called Beyond 50 Shades. That image, in which the man had his thumb on the inside of his pants, was incorrectly approved, a Facebook spokeswoman recently said.
