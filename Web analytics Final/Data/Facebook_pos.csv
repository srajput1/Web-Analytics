 Should Facebook pay us for our puppy pictures? Of course, the idea sounds crazy. Posting puppies on Facebook is not a chore. We love it: Facebook’s 1.4 billion daily users spend the better part of an hour on it every day. It’s amazing that we don’t have to pay for it. And yet the idea is gaining momentum in Silicon Valley and beyond: Facebook and the other technological Goliaths offering free online services — from which they harvest data from and about their users — should pay for every nugget of information they reap. The spring break pictures on Instagram, the YouTube video explaining Minecraft tactics, the internet searches and the Amazon purchases, even your speed following Waze on the way to spend Thanksgiving with your in-laws — this data is valuable. It will become more valuable, potentially much more so, in the not-too-distant future. Getting companies to pay transparently for the information will not just provide a better deal for the users whose data is scooped up as they go about their online lives. It will also improve the quality of the data on which the information economy is being built. And it could undermine the data titans’ stranglehold on technology’s future, breathing fresh air into an economy losing its vitality. Advertisement The idea has been around for a bit. Jaron Lanier, the tech philosopher and virtual-reality pioneer who now works for Microsoft Research, proposed it in his 2013 book, “Who Owns the Future?,” as a needed corrective to an online economy mostly financed by advertisers’ covert manipulation of users’ consumer choices. It is being picked up in “Radical Markets,” a book due out shortly from Eric A. Posner of the University of Chicago Law School and E. Glen Weyl, principal researcher at Microsoft. And it is playing into European efforts to collect tax revenue from American internet giants. In a report obtained last month by Politico, the European Commission proposes to impose a tax on the revenue of digital companies based on their users’ location, on the grounds that “a significant part of the value of a business is created where the users are based and data is collected and processed.” Users’ data is a valuable commodity. Facebook offers advertisers precisely targeted audiences based on user profiles. YouTube, too, uses users’ preferences to tailor its feed. Still, this pales in comparison with how valuable data is about to become, as the footprint of artificial intelligence extends across the economy. Data is the crucial ingredient of the A.I. revolution. Training systems to perform even relatively straightforward tasks like voice translation, voice transcription or image recognition requires vast amounts of data — like tagged photos, to identify their content, or recordings with transcriptions. Advertisement “Among leading A.I. teams, many can likely replicate others’ software in, at most, one to two years,” notes the technologist Andrew Ng. “But it is exceedingly difficult to get access to someone else’s data. Thus data, rather than software, is the defensible barrier for many businesses.” We may think we get a fair deal, offering our data as the price of sharing puppy pictures. By other metrics, we are being victimized: In the largest technology companies, the share of income going to labor is only about 5 to 15 percent, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl write. That’s way below Walmart’s 80 percent. Consumer data amounts to work they get free. “If these A.I.-driven companies represent the future of broader parts of the economy,” they argue, “without something basic changing in their business model, we may be headed for a world where labor’s share falls dramatically from its current roughly 70 percent to something closer to 20 to 30 percent.”  . As Mr. Lanier, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl point out, it is ironic that humans are providing free data to train the artificial-intelligence systems to replace workers across the economy. Commentators from both left and right fret over how ordinary people will put food on the table once robots take all the jobs. Perhaps a universal basic income, funded by taxes, is the answer? How about paying people for the data they produced to train the robots? If A.I. accounted for 10 percent of the economy and the big-data companies paid two-thirds of their income for data — the same as labor’s share of income across the economy — the share of income going to “workers” would rise drastically. By Mr. Weyl and Mr. Posner’s reckoning, the median household of four would gain $20,000 a year. A critical consideration is that if people were paid for their data, its quality and value would increase. Facebook could directly ask users to tag the puppy pictures to train the machines. It could ask translators to upload their translations. Facebook and Google could demand quality information if the value of the transaction were more transparent. Unwilling to enter in a direct quid pro quo with their users, the data titans must make do with whatever their users submit. The transition would not be painless. We would need to figure out systems to put value on data. Your puppy pictures might turn out to be worthless, but that college translation from Serbo-Croatian could be valuable. Barred from free data, YouTube and Facebook might charge a user fee for their service — like Netflix. Alternatively, they might make their money from training A.I. systems and pay some royalty stream to the many people whose data helped train them. But whatever the cost, the transformation seems worthwhile. Notably, it could help resolve one of the most relevant questions coming into focus in this new technological age: Who will control the data? Today, the dominant data harvesters in the business are Google and Facebook, with Amazon, Apple and Microsoft some way behind. Their dominance cannot really be challenged: Could you think of a rival search engine? Could another social network replace the one all your friends are on? This dominance might matter less if companies had to pay for their users’ data. Advertisement Google and Facebook and Amazon would not be able to extend the network effects that cemented their place at the top of the technology ecosystem to the world of A.I. Everybody wants to be on Facebook because everybody’s friends are on Facebook. But this dominance could be eroded if rivals made direct offers of money for data. Companies with different business models might join the fray. “This is an opportunity for other companies to enter and say look, we will pay you for this data,” Mr. Posner said. “All this is so new that ordinary people haven’t figured out how manipulated they are by these companies.” The big question, of course, is how we get there from here. My guess is that it would be naïve to expect Google and Facebook to start paying for user data of their own accord, even if that improved the quality of the information. Could policymakers step in, somewhat the way the European Commission did, demanding that technology companies compute the value of consumer data? In any event, there is probably a better deal out there, in your future, than giving Facebook free puppy pictures.

 Supported by Square Feet New “hyperscale” data centers from the tech giants, part of a wave of global development, helped lead Prineville to a path of recovery. By Keith Schneider PRINEVILLE, ORE. — A decade ago, when five shuttered sawmills and 20 percent unemployment defined Crook County, Ore., nobody envisioned that the path to recovery would be tied to Facebook and Apple. But on the rimrock summit overlooking this city, the county seat and home to 10,000 residents, Facebook is sinking the footings for the first of two 450,000-square-foot data centers that together will cost $1 billion when completed in 2021. The immense buildings will join the four existing data centers, totaling 1.27 million square feet, that Facebook has built here since 2010 at a cost of $1.1 billion. They are among 11 centers the company has built in the United States and overseas. Nearby, Apple built its own $988 million, 660,000-square-foot data center, which the company will soon expand to one million square feet. It is one of seven built by Apple in the United States. One more is under construction in Iowa, and three others are planned in China, Denmark and Ireland, according to an Apple spokeswoman. The Facebook and Apple projects here are part of a wave of global data center construction and development, a market valued at $88 billion last year, according to Synergy Research Group, a market research firm in Reno, Nev. There’s not much architectural excitement about a data center. But the windowless, big-box buildings form the climate-controlled central nervous system of online commerce and communications. They are as essential to the basic economic infrastructure of the 21st century as iron ore mines and auto assembly plants were to the 20th. What distinguishes them is their size. Prineville’s Facebook and Apple centers are among 386 “hyperscale” data centers around the world, built and operated by the 24 biggest internet and technology companies, including Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, eBay, Microsoft and Yahoo. A study this year by Cisco, the Silicon Valley networking company, projected the number of hyperscale data centers to grow to 628 by 2021. Those centers could command more than half of all data center internet traffic. The United States accounts for more than half of all data center construction, Cisco said, followed by Asia, Western Europe and Latin America. A study in 2017 by CBRE Research found that certain metropolitan regions — Chicago, Detroit, New Jersey, New York, Northern Virginia and Silicon Valley — were the most active areas for data center construction in the United States. Like the big industrial projects of the previous century, the investments that Facebook, Apple and their competitors have made in land, buildings and equipment are considerable, typically more than $1 billion each. The centers consume prodigious amounts of electricity and water, just like factories. Property tax breaks that Oregon and other states use to lure data centers also are comparable. What is different is slim staffing. Facebook employs around 200 people here to manage buildings 1,000 feet long. Inside are aisle after aisle of computer servers networked to receive, store, stream and transmit the flood of digital bytes that steer daily life for more than two billion people. “The market is very big because the demand is huge,” said Rob Johnson, chief executive of Vertiv, a $4 billion global technology company in Columbus, Ohio, that designs, builds and supplies equipment to data centers. “Data centers serve the requirements for all the smartphones, streaming, high-definition video and all the new applications like autonomous vehicles. The technology is driving immense amounts of data and traffic.” Lucrative tax incentives are the rare area of data center development that has come under criticism. Iowa last year awarded Apple $208 million in tax breaks to build a $1.3 billion center in rural Waukee that would employ 50 people. “The big tech companies are getting huge tax breaks to build things they would build anyway,” said Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, a research group in Washington. “The cost to taxpayers is enormous for data centers that create very few permanent jobs.” Oregon’s incentive package allows both companies to avoid property taxes for 15 years, saving Facebook and Apple roughly $45 million each over that period. State law also has a sweetener for cities. Companies receiving the tax break are required to pay employees 150 percent of the median regional wage. Prineville data center workers earn at least $60,000 a year. Prineville counts 400 permanent jobs in the data centers, influencing its small-town culture, filling the municipal treasury and transforming its sagebrush and juniper landscape. Mayor Betty Roppe noted that Facebook and Apple provided Prineville with income from other municipal accounts. For instance, the city receives a 5 percent “franchise” fee on all electricity sales in its jurisdiction. Because Facebook’s and Apple’s centers consume nearly $40 million in electricity annually, total franchise fees last year reached $2.2 million, up from $340,000 in 2010. When the abatements expire midway through the 2020s, the value of Prineville’s taxable property will increase by roughly $2 billion, more than doubling the total from the $1.5 billion in property currently assessed by the city. Revenue is projected to reach $9 million annually, up from $4 million currently. “We were a cowboy and timber town,” said Steve Forrester, Prineville’s city manager and a former sawmill executive. “We went from ‘I got to go feed my cows’ to the most technically advanced companies in the world siting data centers in our little town. It freaked some people out.” Once-struggling Prineville has become a factor in turning central Oregon into a dynamic region of demographic and economic transition. It is becoming a bedroom community for Bend, 36 miles away, where the population has nearly doubled since 2000, making it the sixth-fastest-growing city in the country. The data centers also are changing the region’s electrical market. Avangrid Renewables just opened one of Oregon’s largest solar-generating stations outside Prineville, a $120 million, 56-megawatt plant to supply clean energy to Apple. Crook County authorities say they have entertained inquiries for building four more solar stations of similar size to supply data center needs. In 2009, when Ms. Roppe was a member of the City Council, she convened planning meetings with city executives to save Prineville from sawmill shutdowns and a deep recession. Her economic goals were straightforward: diversifying the economy and seeking companies willing to pay living wages. “Our unadjusted employment was 24 percent,” she said. “So we did whatever we had to do to change that.” When seven lawyers arrived in town to scout land for a company called Vitesse, she learned how competitive Prineville was to data center developers. The city and region fill all basic requirements — available land, ample electricity, access to fresh water, proximity to markets and generous tax breaks. Another advantage was cool summers — Facebook cools its data centers with fresh air. Ms. Roppe and her aides soon were made aware that Vitesse was a disguise for Facebook. The company bought 127 acres near the airport for $2.7 million and publicly revealed itself at a groundbreaking ceremony in January 2010. A year later, Apple’s scouts arrived as agents of a front company called Pillar. “We always were left guessing as to who we were dealing with,” Ms. Roppe said. In 2012, after buying 160 acres for $3.6 million, Apple started construction of its big data center. The presence of two big Silicon Valley companies once unnerved Prineville. Though most data center employees are from Crook County, young people wearing hoodies and driving late-model electric hybrid cars were a new presence in bars and on streets where cowboy hats and pickups once dominated. “There was anxiousness,” Mr. Forrester said. “The mill types were going around saying: ‘We don’t want the Mark Zuckerberg types. They’re going to ruin our town.’” Anxiety about newcomers has been replaced by relief over local business generated by the data centers, and new stress over rising housing costs. Residential and office vacancy rates are under 5 percent. “Facebook and Apple brought a lot to this community,” said Erika Vaughan, the owner of Cougar Cuts barbershop. “They are big, but they support small business.” Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS One subscription.Endless discovery.

 PARIS —  France's competition authority may open investigations into Facebook and Google ""in the next few months"" after an in-depth examination concluded the pair dominate the French online advertising market. The regulator said it was considering a full inquiry on Tuesday amid growing scrutiny from European authorities of the biggest internet companies, whose size and sway over data collection have rapidly made them advertising giants. ""What is clear is the overwhelmingly dominant position of Google and Facebook,"" president of the French competition body, Isabelle de Silva, said. The authority's report highlighted that the two companies acted as both publishers and technical intermediaries for advertisers, giving them a competitive advantage. Advertisement ""Facebook is only one option among many others for advertisers to reach audiences,"" Delphine Reyre, Facebook's director of policy for Europe, said in a statement. Advertisement Facebook and Google, which did not immediately comment, accounted for 76 percent of internet ad spending outside China in 2016, a report by Publicis agency Zenith found. The situation is the same in France, where the internet has become the number one vehicle for advertisers, ahead of television, with more than a third of total ad spending in 2017, up 3.4 percentage points from 2016.  . ANTI-COMPETITIVE ""We've seen many players complain about certain behaviors,"" de Silva said, referring to meetings the authority had with French advertisers, service providers and publishers. These include strategies involving bundling or tied sales, low prices, discriminatory treatment and restrictions on the possibilities of collecting and accessing certain data. The French competition authority can impose fines of up to 10 percent of a company's total yearly revenues. Any investigation takes about two years to reach a conclusion and any sanction. ""Broadcasters, traditional media, and a range of other online platforms are increasingly using data and sophisticated targeting techniques to deliver relevant ads to users, and there is no barrier preventing other new entrants doing the same,"" Facebook's Reyre said.

— The changing dynamics of the U.S. workforce — its shrinking pool of available workers and ever-increasing use of technology — have led some small business owners and managers to be more creative when recruiting staffers. Some companies use online messaging or chatting programs to screen a candidate, even before they have a phone or in-person interview. Other companies use Facebook, Instagram and other social media channels to lure potential hires. Others go low-tech: They offer free training to prospective hires because of a shortage of skilled workers, or meet with candidates in casual atmospheres like coffee shops away from the office. Owners say they're changing the way they hire because the workplace, as well as society, is also changing. Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS One subscription.Endless discovery.

 BEIJING — In a country where the Communist Party makes all the big decisions, Chinese lawmakers hold very little political power. But they have plenty of money — $650 billion of it — and that’s growing. According to the Hurun Report, a research organization in Shanghai that tracks the wealthy in China, the net worth of the 153 members of China’s Parliament and its advisory body that it deems “super rich” amounts to $650 billion, up by nearly a third from a year ago. That is just a touch below Switzerland’s annual economic output. While President Xi Jinping has pledged to close the income gap and alleviate poverty, the wealth of the nation’s lawmakers has kept soaring. In 2017, it topped $500 billion, more than doubling from the year before. The surge in wealth reflects the strength of the Chinese economy, which grew 6.9 percent in 2017, and stock markets all over the world. Delegates to Parliament, or the National People’s Congress, rubber-stamp most of the policies set out by the party’s leadership and are expected to approve Mr. Xi’s plan to scrap term limits and allow him to rule indefinitely when they meet in Beijing next week. But the gathering provides businesspeople with an opportunity to hobnob with one another. The title of delegate also gives them extra cachet in making business deals. Advertisement The number of billionaires in China’s legislature could contribute to the perception that the government is out of touch in a country where disposable income per capita was just over $4,000 in 2017. But many Chinese are proud of how quickly the ranks are growing. China added 210 billionaires over the past year — about four a week — 40 percent more than the United States, according to a separate list of the global rich by Hurun. Advertisement The wealthiest lawmaker is also China’s richest person, Pony Ma, whose net worth is $47 billion. He is the founder of Tencent, which owns WeChat, a social media mobile app that is indispensable in Chinese life. Tencent is now valued at $540 billion, more than Facebook. Mr. Ma was trailed by Xu Jiayin, the chairman of the property developer Evergrande Group, whose net worth is $41 billion. Mr. Xu was China’s richest person in 2017, according to Hurun.  . Other Chinese property developers also dominated the list. Lee Ka-kit, vice chairman of Henderson Land Development, is worth $34 billion, while the net worth of Country Garden Group’s founder, Yang Guoqiang, reached $32 billion. The fortunes of China’s entrepreneurs have changed significantly since the Communist Party, which was founded to work for the interests of workers and stamp out capitalism, welcomed businesspeople into the party more than a decade ago. About 20 percent of the nearly 3,000 delegates to Parliament are businesspeople, according to government news media. Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, and an expert on money and politics in China, said that being a member of the National People’s Congress “affords a considerable protection for the wealthy.” “If you’re part of the NPC, you become a state cadre, and so the local police can’t arrest you easily without cause,” he said, referring to the congress. “That’s not the case for a wealthy person who has no affiliation with the Chinese government, and wealth becomes very vulnerable to predatory action by a local government.” Zhang Tiantian contributed research.

 The House on Tuesday passed a bill that gives victims and prosecutors more power to sue websites that knowingly aided sex trafficking, adding a new level of accountability for internet companies. Silicon Valley had strongly opposed the bill, because it would chip away at an existing law that gives internet companies broad immunity for the content that people put on their services. Tech companies that argued against the bill said that the current law has encouraged free speech online and helped the internet thrive. But sex trafficking victims and law enforcement officials say the existing law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, has been too loosely applied by sites like Backpage.com, a site known for prostitution and sex trafficking. Some large online companies, including Facebook, eventually backed off from their opposition to the bill after its scope was narrowed. “Congress never intended for the internet to be a haven for criminal activity,” said Representative Ann Wagner, a Missouri Republican who introduced the bill, known as the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act. “This is not a slippery slope. It is a narrow amendment to stop crimes by businesses online that they weren’t able to commit offline.” Advertisement A similar bill in the Senate was expected to pass soon. The new legislation would not affect most internet companies. A victim would need to prove a site had knowingly facilitated sex trafficking to successfully sue the company. But not all online companies could hide behind the Section 230 shield. Advertisement The bill’s passage in the House signaled an important turning point for an industry that has largely operated free of regulations. Pressure has been mounting for social media companies and other internet giants to be better stewards of their powerful platforms. Facebook, in particular, has come under pressure over the spread of misinformation and the exertion of foreign interference during the 2016 presidential election. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have called for regulations, including disclosures on political advertising, but those efforts have been slow to gain wide support.  . “Clearly the environment has changed a lot for big internet companies over the past year,” said Paul Gallant, a tech and telecom industry analyst at Cowen & Co. “But I still don’t think there is a willingness for the government to pursue fundamental business model changes.” Facebook began to change its position on the bill last fall, before congressional hearings on sex-trafficking bills and an intelligence committee hearing on Russian influence on social networks. “We all have a responsibility to do our part to fight this,” Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, wrote in a post on the site this week. “We at Facebook support efforts to pass amended legislation in the House that would allow responsible companies to continue fighting sex trafficking while giving victims the chance to seek justice against companies that knowingly facilitate such abhorrent acts.” Some large tech companies, including Oracle, IBM and HP, have supported the new legislative effort all along. But many start-ups, including those represented by Engine Advocacy, a trade group, remained opposed to the bills. Engine Advocacy said part of the bill would hurt start-ups that lean heavily on user-generated content, and could lead Congress to take more actions to weaken the openness of the internet.

 Many months after it became clear that Russians exploited Facebook to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, the reach and impact of Russia’s activities on the social network are still not fully known. The indictment announced on Friday in the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, charged 13 Russians and does not accuse Facebook or Instagram of any wrongdoing. But the names of those two networks appear 41 times in the indictment. The dribble of information about Russian actors’ use of Facebook, as well as confusing messages coming from the company, has raised even more questions. Here’s a look at what we know and what other information Facebook might be able to provide. So far, Facebook executives have implied that the influence campaign was minor in the scheme of things. Advertisement The company has released numbers that suggest the Russians reached a large number of people. In testimony to Congress last year, Colin Stretch, Facebook’s general counsel, said that roughly 126 million people may have been “served content” from a Facebook page associated with the Internet Research Agency, the notorious Russian troll factory, over a two-year period. Advertisement But Mr. Stretch added that this content was a smidgen of the total content available across Facebook: “This equals about four-thousandths of 1 percent (0.004 percent) of content in News Feed, or approximately one out of 23,000 pieces of content.” And on Friday, Rob Goldman, Facebook’s vice president for ads, noted that more than half of the Russian Facebook ads (56 percent) were served after the 2016 election. 
            The majority of the Russian ad spend happened AFTER the election. We shared that fact, but very few outlets have covered it because it doesn’t align with the main media narrative of Tump and the election. https://t.co/2dL8Kh0hof  Quoting tiny fractions suggests content on Facebook gets drowned out in a torrent of information. But the company’s whole business model is based on giving ads and posts prominence in the feeds of well-targeted users. Questions for Facebook: Has Facebook performed any analyses that looks at smaller groups of people? If so, can Facebook share them? And how did the ads perform before and after the election? Mr. Mueller’s latest indictment says that, after the middle of 2016, Russians often talked about targeting “purple states,” or those in which the number of Republican and Democratic voters are close. The indictment also describes the Russians as focused on Florida, which Mr. Trump ended up winning. “On or about August 4, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators created and purchased Facebook advertisements for the ‘Florida Goes Trump’ rally. The advertisements reached over 59,000 Facebook users in Florida, and over 8,300 Facebook users responded to the advertisements by clicking on it.” Others have asserted in the past that Russia did not appear to focus its social media efforts on swing states. As Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, noted last year: “What you haven’t heard is that almost five times more ads were targeted at Maryland than Wisconsin. Maryland, which was targeted by 262 ads in comparison to Wisconsin’s 55, wasn’t up for grabs; it was a state the Democratic candidate carried by 26 percent.” Questions for Facebook:  Do the company’s records show that Russia-backed ads and posts reached a higher number of people in certain states or regions of the United States? If so, how responsive were Facebook users in those targeted regions to the Russian posts and ads? Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia, has done revealing work on Facebook’s Russia-linked pages that is more detailed than anything the company has made public. Mr. Albright’s data, obtained using CrowdTangle, an analytics tool owned by Facebook, shows the speed with which the Russia-backed groups grew. Blacktivist, a Russia-linked group whose often inflammatory content set it apart from legitimate groups championing African-American rights, had 14,000 followers at the end of 2015. By the time its Facebook page was shut down last year, it had 390,000, according to Mr. Albright’s data — a hugely successful ramp up that took Blacktivist’s total followers above that for Black Lives Matter. Other Russian-created groups, like Heart of Texas, also showed huge increases in followers. Questions for Facebook: How exactly were these groups able to scoop up so many members so quickly? Did the speed of the increases wave any red flags internally at Facebook? To what extent did Facebook’s ad targeting tools, which allow advertisers to reach specific groups of people, enable Russia to put incendiary posts in the feeds of certain groups? And one from Mr. Albright: What were the follower totals and other data for any private Facebook pages that were backed by the Russians? It may well be the case that Russian disinformation did not swing the election for Mr. Trump. But it may have had far more of an impact than the public knows. And Facebook is almost certainly sitting on data that could deepen the nation’s understanding of what went on. “I can’t imagine what it would it look like if we had all the data,” Mr. Albright said.

 SEATTLE —  Microsoft Corp on Monday said 200,000 organizations are now using Teams, its year-old workplace collaboration software, up from 125,000 in September, a sign the company may be making some progress in its battle with Slack Technologies Inc. Microsoft also announced a slate of new features for Teams, including instant language translation. Slack's emergence as a popular platform for workplace messaging and document-sharing is a threat to Microsoft's long-standing dominance in office productivity software. Teams now comes bundled with Microsoft Office 365 as the company battles rival offerings from companies including privately-held Slack, Alphabet Inc's Google, Atlassian Corp PLC, Cisco Systems Inc and Facebook Inc. ""These group messaging tools go far beyond just chat and are becoming a central hub for integrating a variety of business applications into a single user interface,"" said Alan Lepofsky, analyst with Constellation Research. ""They are essentially the new inbox."" Advertisement Microsoft has raced to make Teams a viable competitor after realizing several years ago that Slack was making inroads with big customers. A former Microsoft Office executive told Reuters that learning of the widespread adoption of Slack at Walt Disney Co in early 2015 was an especially important wake-up call. Advertisement ""It's one thing when an app gains traction with startups in Silicon Valley, that happens all the time,"" said the former employee, who asked not to be named. ""But it's another when your biggest, longest-tenured customers start adopting it, and then you realize you have to respond."" San Francisco-based Slack said in September that it had 6 million daily users and more than 50,000 paying teams. It has not published new figures since then. Microsoft has not released comparable figures for Teams. Slack has a big lead when it comes to third-party applications, with more than 1,000 compared to 250 for Teams.  . Teams is still not as simple to use as Slack and lacks the depth of functionality, said Wayne Kurtzman, an analyst with the research firm IDC. ""As great as Microsoft Teams has done in the past year, it's still not as mature of a product,"" Kurtzman said. Microsoft says it is gaining ground, pointing to customers such as Navistar, the manufacturer of trucks and buses. Navistar moved about a thousand employees onto Teams last year, choosing it over Slack due to its long-time relationship with Microsoft, said Terry Kline, Navistar chief information officer. ""We looked at Slack, and we didn't see any significant advantage,"" Kline told Reuters in a phone interview. The move has reduced the company's use of email by 3 percent, he added. Other Teams customers include Macy's, General Motors, General Electric, ConocoPhillips and Nascar, according to Microsoft. ""It's surprised all of us how extremely well it's doing,"" Microsoft Teams General Manager Lori Wright told Reuters.

 In a sunny office in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, Mike Schmidt spends his time ferreting out fake Instagram accounts. Some are obvious, like the one that had never posted a photo and lacked a profile picture yet followed about 7,500 accounts — the maximum allowed by the social media site. Others are trickier. Mr. Schmidt had to scroll down a little on an account with the name @ailebnoblk before the same stock image of a car showed up three times in a row, a clue that there was no real person behind the profile. “The amount of bot activity that’s happening on these platforms is pretty insane,” Mr. Schmidt said. “Just the amount of new accounts and times these folks are liking and commenting with spam and positive comments and happy-face emojis.” Dovetale, a four-person software company Mr. Schmidt co-founded in 2016, has devised a range of tactics to identify large numbers of fake accounts that follow popular Instagram personalities. It then packages that information for marketers, who are increasingly skeptical of the audience numbers that often determine how much money social media stars can command from advertisers. Marketers are flocking to businesses like Dovetale, prompted by revelations like those in a recent investigation by The New York Times that detailed the booming industry of people buying fake followers and fraudulent engagement on Twitter and other social media sites. Some of these fake accounts, in an attempt to seem legitimate, use personal information from real people without their knowledge. That has provoked concern among brands and their agencies, which often rely on metrics like the number of followers an account has when hiring people on YouTube and Instagram to promote their products. These social media stars can often fetch thousands of dollars for one post promoting a product. “We knew this kind of day of reckoning would come,” said Erick Schwab, the co-founder of Sylo, which vets influencers for fraud and aims to assign a numerical score to their content akin to a Nielsen rating. “We’ve gotten tons of brands, agencies, vendors emailing us, who we’ve been having conversations with for a while, but now they’re sort of like, this is being demanded.” Krishna Subramanian, a founder of Captiv8, which connects brands with influencers, has seen a surge in requests for fraud detection from agencies. “Everyone is definitely scrambling because they don’t want to be held responsible,” he said. The interest in such firms reflects how easy it is to fake popularity on platforms like Instagram, where bots seem to run unchecked even on accounts where people have not paid for them. While many advertisers have become aware of this, and tried to place more emphasis on content quality or favorable comments, follower numbers still tend to loom large. “Even though brands are looking for engagement more, the actual pay and compensation that influencers are getting is still based on the follower number,” said Alivia Latimer, a photographer with about 102,000 Instagram followers. Ms. Latimer, who has worked with brands including Lush Cosmetics and Hollister, said that she charged about $1,200 for a branded post. She added that she knew people with two million followers who charge $40,000 per post. That means new kinds of detective work are needed for brands that still want the endorsements of the young and hip online. Dovetale said it uses more than 50 metrics to analyze the Instagram followers of popular accounts, including the language in the bios, the rate at which they hit “like” and “follow,” and their country of origin. (An influencer with a high number of followers from Turkey, Brazil and China, for instance, can raise red flags for Dovetale, which has frequently seen fake followers come from those countries.) The clues can be complex. Dovetale flagged one account that claimed to be someone named Meg Cragle because it was part of a group of profiles that had made one or two unrelated posts and contained similarly worded bios of exactly 99 characters that ended with ellipses. The discovery was reinforced by a Google search for phrases in the account’s bio like “award-winning bacon fanatic,” which matched the terms in a now-deleted Twitter bio generator online. Dovetale acknowledged that its methods were not foolproof, but they are valuable enough in a murky landscape that the agency 360i said it was now unlikely to hire influencers for campaigns if Dovetale’s database said more than 2 to 3 percent of their followers were bots. Dovetale said that, on average, 16.4 percent of the followers on Instagram’s top 20 accounts were fraudulent. Sylo, which requires influencers to share access to their public and private post statistics, said it had rejected 77 percent of influencers who have tried to register on its platform after their accounts showed issues like abnormal spikes in engagement on posts or a large number of generic, emoji-laden comments that bots are known for. “In the absence of direct pressure on the platforms, it’s a way for advertisers to take more control of their own spend and not be at the mercy of the platforms themselves,” said Jeff Semones, head of social media at MediaCom, which has recommended Sylo to clients. While he said Instagram had removed many accounts that were flagrantly violating its terms and conditions, “a lot of one-off activity goes unchecked.” A spokeswoman for Instagram said that the platform’s “internal estimates show that spam accounts make up a small fraction” of Instagram’s 800 million monthly users. Some believe that the new awareness around bots highlights the misguided expectations that marketers have for how many people they can reach through influencers. Changes to algorithms on Facebook and Instagram have significantly reduced the number of people who will see a person’s posts without paid promotion. And unless advertisers are paying Instagram for the information, they typically have to rely on screenshots from influencers for data on how many people saw a post. Influencers like Ms. Latimer said that even then, not all brands request those screenshots. Tyler Stark, director of marketing at Traeger Grills, said that many influencers, particularly on Facebook, reach only 2 percent of their audience. That has made smaller influencers more appealing and put a focus on engagement, he said, with the thought that a post with a large number of likes and comments will end up in the feeds of more people. Still, Bob Gilbreath, chief executive of Ahalogy, a marketing technology company in Cincinnati, said that he recently heard a major retailer recommend that brands work only with influencers who have at least 200,000 followers. “Most brands would say that a follower is someone who’s definitely going to see the post,” Mr. Gilbreath said. “Not only are most people not seeing the posts even if they’re real people, but many of them are not real people.” Soapbox Influencer Marketing, a company that connects brands with influencers, features a case study on its website for a new hummus from Bush’s Beans. The site claims that the campaign, which featured 519 influencer posts, resulted in a whopping 891 million impressions — nearly triple the American population. When asked about the figure, Beth Stephens, the company’s president, said it was “incorrectly listed on our website and needs to be corrected.” She added that Bush’s Beans also worked with “a number of other influence and social service providers,” making it difficult for Soapbox to directly assess the figure. Bush’s Beans didn’t return requests for comment. Others tout the “total reach” of fashion and food influencers on their websites. In other types of media and Instagram’s own business analytics, “reach” refers to the number of different people who actually saw an ad. But in influencer marketing, it often refers to an aggregation of followers across platforms and can even include monthly unique visitors to blogs. Mr. Gilbreath is still a proponent of the work that comes out of social media mavens, but has instead focused on hiring creative “micro” influencers with 10,000 or more followers. The firm pays to promote their recipes or tips and tracks subsequent visits to their websites, he said, adding that the data is otherwise too unreliable. Corey Martin, head of influencer marketing at 360i, said that the agency was increasingly paying Instagram to promote posts from influencers, which allows the agency to “track and trace consumer behavior in a way we previously hadn’t.” Some hope for more action from Instagram, especially since it plans to restrict access to some of its data later this year, which may impede the work of bot-hunters like Dovetale. “It will be unfair until Instagram really just cleans out the bots and the lurkers,” said Caitlin Sakdalan, who runs the account @BeFatBeHappy. “There’s so many different programs that people use and algorithms and we can all say this and all say that, but until Instagram itself kind of does it for the community, I think it will be an unfair playing field.” Email Sapna Maheshwari at sapna@nytimes.com or follow her on Twitter: @sapna.

 (Reuters) - Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google corporate brands dropped in an annual survey while Amazon.com Inc maintained the top spot for the third consecutive year, and electric carmaker Telsa Inc rocketed higher after sending a red Roadster into space. IPhone maker Apple dropped to 29th from its previous position of No. 5, and Google dropped from 8th to No. 28. Apple had ranked No. 2 as recently as 2016, according to the annual Harris Poll Reputation Quotient poll released on Tuesday. The poll, conducted since 1999, surveyed 25,800 U.S. adults from Dec. 11 to Jan. 12 on the reputations the ""most visible"" corporate brands. John Gerzema, CEO of the Harris Poll, told Reuters in an interview that the likely reason Apple and Google fell was that they have not introduced as many attention-grabbing products as they did in past years, such as when Google rolled out free offerings like its Google Docs word processor or Google Maps and Apple's then-CEO Steve Jobs introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad. Advertisement ""Google and Apple, at this moment, are sort of in valleys,"" Gerzema said. ""We're not quite to self-driving cars yet. We're not yet seeing all the things in artificial intelligence they're going to do."" Advertisement Meanwhile, Amazon.com held on to the No. 1 spot, which it has held for five years with the exception of 2015, when it slipped to No. 2. Gerzema attributed Amazon's ranking to its expanding footprint in consumers' lives into areas like groceries via its Whole Foods acquisition. Elon Musk's Tesla climbed from No. 9 to No. 3 on the strength of sending Tesla Roadster into space aboard a SpaceX rocket - despite fleeting success delivering cars on time on earth, Gerzema said.  . ""He's a modern-day carnival barker - it's incredible,"" Gerzema said of Musk. ""This 'The Right Stuff' attitude is able to capture the public's imagination when every news headline is incredibly negative. They're filling a void of optimism."" For its part, Facebook Inc's reputation improved in the 2018 study, despite being the target of questions from U.S. lawmakers about the role of social media in Russia's efforts to influence the U.S. presidential election in 2016. Facebook ranked 51st, its best showing since 2014 when it ranked 38th, the highest the firm ever ranked in the poll. This year, film production company The Weinstein Co made its debut at 99th out of 100 on the list after more than 70 women accused co-founder Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, including rape. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Last place went to Japanese auto parts supplier Takata Corp, whose air bags can explode with too much force and have been linked to at least 22 deaths and hundreds of injuries, prompting the largest recall in automotive history and forcing Takata and its U.S. unit, TK Holdings Inc, into bankruptcy. 1.

 WASHINGTON —  First lady Melania Trump is bringing together tech giants to talk about ways to fight cyberbullying and promote internet safety, representatives of three companies said Tuesday. Among the companies expected to attend the March 20 meeting: Amazon, Snap, Facebook, Google and Twitter. The meeting was confirmed by Amazon and representatives of two companies speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the plans publicly. Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Trump, said in a statement that Mrs. Trump ""has simply asked for a meeting to discuss one of the many things that impacts children — as she has done many times in the past, on several different topics."" The meeting, first reported by The Washington Post, would mark Mrs. Trump's first public event on a subject she has previously expressed interest in. During the first year of her husband's administration, she played a low-key role. Advertisement Her interest in children has been clear, with visits to schools and hospitals. In her first public remarks at the United Nations last year, Mrs. Trump called on world leaders to come together for the good of their children, saying: ""We must remember that they are watching and listening, so we must never miss an opportunity to teach life's many ethical lessons along the way.""  . During the presidential campaign, Melania Trump mentioned doing work to address bullying — a notable choice given the president-elect's penchant for name-calling on social media. It can take some time for a first lady to launch personal projects. Michelle Obama began her ""Let's Move"" initiative about a year into her husband's first term.

 Within hours of announcing its decision to end a credit card relationship with the National Rifle Association, the First National Bank of Omaha found itself thrust into the center of the resurgent national gun debate. Its Twitter and Facebook pages were flooded with comments. Some customers applauded the 160-year-old bank’s decision. Others said they would take their business elsewhere. In the aftermath of the deadly school shooting in Florida last week, businesses were making the same financial and moral calculus, quickly discovering that there is no neutral ground. As pressure mounted across various social media platforms on Friday, a number of corporations, including several car-rental companies, MetLife insurance, Symantec security software and the car pricing and information site TrueCar, abruptly announced plans to cut ties with the organization. The actions continued on Saturday. Delta and United Airlines both issued statements saying they were ending discount programs with the N.R.A. and would ask the association to remove their information from its website. Advertisement Over the last couple of years, social media has become the preferred vehicle for the rise of consumer activism, turning the everyday purchase of dresses or shoes or, now, renting a car or buying insurance, into a form of protest or demonstration of ideology. Advertisement “MetLife didn’t shoot anyone, but I just can’t pay them,” Clark Bacon, a research assistant at a children’s hospital, said in an interview Friday morning, after posting about his frustration on the company’s Facebook page. He had pledged to cancel his MetLife auto and home insurance package, for which he spends nearly $9,000 a year, after learning that the company offered N.R.A. members pre-negotiated discounts. For companies like MetLife that are caught in the middle of these angry social media storms, actions tied to divisive social issues can be a lose-lose proposition. A year ago, Nordstrom first faced calls for a consumer boycott because it carried the Ivanka Trump line of clothing. But it quickly drew another round of boycott cries from the other side of the ideological spectrum when it quietly stopped selling her products. Marketing experts say it’s difficult to determine whether calls for boycotts can truly have an impact on a company’s business. Rather, they say, once-angry customers either forget or move on to the next event or debate. “Memories fade. The intensity of the feelings that people have on this subject right now will feel different one month or five months from now,” said Maurice Schweitzer, a professor of operations, information and decisions at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. In the aftermath of nearly all of the mass shootings in the United States, there have been attempts to pressure lawmakers and companies that manufacture or sell guns to change. After the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, both the California’s state pension fund and the California teachers pension fund divested their stakes in gun manufacturers. And after a gunman used an accessory called a bump stock in a mass shooting in Las Vegas last October, two retailers, Walmart and the outdoors store Cabela’s, removed the products from their websites. But in the days since the Florida school shooting, the push for boycotts and meaningful change has mobilized faster than with previous mass shootings. Professor Schweitzer noted that reflected the fact that the survivors are teenagers who are well versed in the usage and power of social media. Advertisement On Twitter, the hashtag #stopNRAmazon was a rallying cry aimed at pressuring Amazon to stop streaming content from NRATV, the gun group’s online video channel. The effort quickly drew support from Hollywood as actors like Alyssa Milano, Denis O’Hare, Evan Handler and Misha Collins posted on social media in support of the campaign; several noted that Amazon prohibits the sale of firearms on its e-commerce site. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. Leading retailers including Cabela’s, Walmart and Bass Pro Shops also came under renewed boycott calls on Twitter for selling guns or sponsoring N.R.A. events. The retailers did not respond to emails seeking comment.  . Still, in some cases, the rapid assembly on Twitter and Facebook may have resulted in a speedy response. In less than 24 hours, at least eight companies that had offered N.R.A. members discounts or special deals announced plans to separate or end affiliations with the organization, including Hertz, Enterprise and Avis Budget; SimpliSafe, which gave N.R.A. members two months of free home security monitoring; and North American and Allied Van Lines. “North American and Allied Van Lines no longer have an affiliate relationship with the N.R.A. effective immediately,’’ the company said in an emailed statement. “We have asked them to remove our listing from their benefits site.” Even companies that do not have ties to the N.R.A. nevertheless rushed to distance themselves from the group. Wyndham Hotels said in a statement that it ended its relationship with the trade group in late 2017. Best Western Hotels & Resorts tweeted to dozens of customers that it “does not have an affiliation with and is not a corporate partner” of the N.R.A. Earlier this week, lists of companies that were part of the N.R.A. membership program began circulating over Facebook and Twitter. A Change.org petition asked 25 companies, including North American Van Lines and the hearing aid company Starkey Hearing Technologies, to break their connection with the N.R.A. The petition had more than 1,100 signatures by midday Friday. With lists of companies circulating widely, Facebook users swarmed the profiles of Avis, MetLife and others, announcing their plans to end their patronage and switch to competitors. Rob Bradford, a designer who travels frequently, said Friday morning he would take the $600 he spends each year renting vehicles from Avis to competing rental companies if Avis did not disavow the N.R.A. “I know that boycotts work, especially in the age of social media,” he said. “I will go out of my way to avoid businesses associated with that group even if that means spending more money.” Advertisement By Friday afternoon, Avis Budget Group, which owns the car rental companies Avis and Budget, said it had decided to end its discount partnership with the N.R.A., effective on March 26, according to a representative. Late Thursday, the First National Bank of Omaha, which calls itself the largest privately owned bank holding company in the country, said that it would not renew its contract with the trade group to issue an N.R.A.-branded credit card. The card had been advertised as “the official credit card of the N.R.A.,” and cardholders were offered a $40 credit with their first purchase. But the move drew strong, even extreme, reaction on the bank’s Facebook page. “You are doing the right thing by dropping the NRA,” one user wrote. “They are a hate group with blood on their hands. Thank you for walking away from them.” But the opposing viewpoint was evident as well. “I discontinued my account with you last night for discontinuing the relationship with the NRA,” another user wrote. “I will encourage all NRA members and gun supporters to do the same. There are 100 million gun owners and 5 million NRA members. Good luck.” A version of this article appears in print on February 24, 2018, on Page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: Connection To N.R.A. Can Be Bad For Business.

 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc's 65 percent jump so far in 2018 has been so fast that Wall Street analysts earlier this week were as much as $60 behind the curve on a stock most say is a buy. The online video streamer's shares have remained well above analysts' average 12-month target for much of this year, and the gap between the actual share price and the mean target hit a two-year high earlier this week, as the graphics below show. (GRAPHIC: Binge-buying - http://reut.rs/2FpQrI4) (GRAPHIC: Netflix leaps past Wall Street - http://reut.rs/2FncVK5) Like the other FAANG technology stocks, Netflix shares have soared over the past few years, driven by subscriber growth. Advertisement While the mean 12-month price target that brokerages have on the shares of Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc, Google-owner Alphabet and Apple Inc are a little above their actual share price, in contrast the mean target for Netflix is well below its current share price. Advertisement That suggests either that shares in the video streaming pioneer are spectacularly overbought, or Wall Street's biggest names have a lot of work to do.  . Three brokerages scrambled to raise their price targets this week, with Pivotal Research raising its target by $100 to $400, while UBS raised its target by $50 to $345. One of the top-rated analysts for the stock, Stifel's Scott Devitt, cut Netflix from ""buy"" to ""hold"" on Thursday while raising his target to $325 from a previous $283.

 Good Friday. Here’s what we’re watching today: • Is Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, planning on stepping down? • The list of those hoping Broadcom fails in its pursuit of Qualcomm keeps growing. • When will wage growth pick up? • Senator Elizabeth Warren has some questions for Apollo and Citi. • How much is Martin Shkreli’s Wu-Tang album worth? • The Trump tariffs have many exceptions. . Don’t already get this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here. Advertisement The Wall Street Journal reported that Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, will step down “as soon as the end of the year,” citing anonymous sources. Advertisement But some important context is necessary: Neither Mr. Blankfein nor the board has set a timeline for him to step down, people briefed on the matter said. Mr. Blankfein has not discussed the possibility of leaving at the end of the year, these people said, though there is a general view that he likely would retire in the next couple of years. And it is very possible that this story may force Mr. Blankfein to move faster to explicitly lay out a timeline than he had originally planned. Is it possible that Mr. Blankfein would step down at the end of 2018? Sure. It is absolutely a possibility, these people said. But it is hardly a certainty. And it is also a possibility that he could step down as C.E.O. but remain chairman, the people said. Is it possible that he could still be at Goldman for part or all of 2019? Sure, these people said. But that’s not a certainty either. Is it possible he is at Goldman in 2020?  That’s less likely, these people agree. Goldman’s board has held discussions about who should succeed Mr. Blankfein ever since Gary Cohn left the firm at the end of 2016, these people said. The board has designated Harvey Schwartz and David Solomon as likely successors, but has not set a specific date for when they need to decide on who will take the reins, these people said. Both men have privately been making plans to take over, these people said. — Andrew Ross Sorkin Here’s Mr. Blankfein’s response to the WSJ story: 
            It's the @WSJ's announcement...not mine. I feel like Huck Finn listening to his own eulogy.         The order President Trump signed on Thursday imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum provided him with wiggle room to exempt countries down the road. In fact, even before signing the order, he suggested the possibility of later excluding allies like Australia. Well, that seems like more of possibility now. Late Friday President Trump said he is working with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on an agreement so Australia will not be subject to the tariffs. 
            Spoke to PM @TurnbullMalcolm of Australia. He is committed to having a very fair and reciprocal military and trade relationship. Working very quickly on a security agreement so we don’t have to impose steel or aluminum tariffs on our ally, the great nation of Australia!         The Wall Street Journal reports that Intel “is considering a range of acquisition alternatives in reaction to Broadcom’s hostile pursuit for Qualcomm.” Advertisement Those options include a possible bid for Broadcom, the WSJ reports citing anonymous sources. Shares of Broadcom jumped 5 percent after hours. Details from the WSJ • Intel is worried about the competitive threat a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm would pose. • Intel has been weighing its options since late last year and has engaged advisers. • Intel might make a bid if Broadcom looks likely to succeed in its pursuit of Qualcomm. Caveats • Any move from Intel is far from certain and one of WSJ’s sources said it is unlikely. Context Washington isn’t so sure a merger of Broadcom and Qualcomm is a good idea. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government panel that reviews transactions’ national security implications, moved to stall the potential takeover of Qualcomm The panel’s intervention put Broadcom’s bid in jeopardy. In practice, reviews by Cfius often lead to the demise of deals. MARCH 9, 2018
 The February jobs report is in. The number of jobs added was the strongest in two years, but wage growth remained lackluster. Advertisement Here are the numbers: • 313,000 jobs were added last month, the most since October 2015. Economists had anticipated a gain of about 200,000. • With revisions to previous months, the three-month average job growth was 242,000 a month. • The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent, the same as in January. • The average hourly wage grew by 0.1 percent. It grew by 0.3 percent in January. The year-over-year increase fell to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent. • The labor force grew by 806,000, pushing the labor force participation rate back up to the 63 percent mark. MARCH 9, 2018
 Context A leap in job gains in February clears the way for the Federal Reserve to raise the benchmark interest rate when it meets this month. The wage figures were disappointing. The jump in hourly earnings in January — which pushed the year-over-year figure to 2.9 percent, from 2.3 percent just three months earlier — was cited as a cause of a market sell-off. With February’s puny growth of 0.1 percent, the year-over-year increase dropped to 2.6 percent. MARCH 9, 2018
 Investors could not have asked for much more from Friday’s jobs report. The numbers for February show the United States economy was able to add a surprisingly large number of new jobs without creating the sort of surge in wages that can prompt investors to worry about inflation. The 10-year Treasury note, which might have sold off on inflation fears, barely budged when the report came out. Futures markets pointed to higher opens for stock markets. Advertisement The economy created 313,000 jobs in February, the most since October 2015. Wages rose 2.6 percent from a year earlier, below the 2.9 percent rate for January that stoked inflation concerns. In theory, as employers add large numbers of new employees, the competition to hire workers should drive wages much higher. Why is that not happening right now? It seems a large number of people who previously weren’t looking for jobs are now entering the work force. That, in part, explains the 800,000 person increase in the labor force. 
            Monster household survey this month: 800k gain in labor force, participation rate and employment-population ratio both up 0.3 percentage points.         But investors will no doubt find something to fret about. Some may decide that the growth in employment is so strong that it won’t be long before wage pressures build up. The amount of slack in the labor force is unknown, so investors shouldn’t rely on it to dampen wage growth indefinitely, according to this view. — Peter Eavis It’s the unknown that torments investors every time the jobs report comes out. Maybe we can shed some light. As Friday’s jobs report showed, the economy is adding large a numbers of jobs without stoking the sort of surge in wages that makes investors worried about inflation. Investors favor these economic conditions because it reduces the chances that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates more quickly than they expect. But how long might wage growth remain moderate? Much depends on how much slack exists in the jobs market. The headline unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, suggests there is very little. But the unemployment rate does not count the people who aren't in the workforce – and who may now enter it. No one knows for sure how many of these people are really looking for a job at any one time, or might do so in the near future. But if there are a lot of them, companies will not struggle to find workers — and wage growth might remain tame. Conversely, if the number of prospective workers on the sideline is small, wage pressures could soon build up. One way to get an idea of the size of this group of people is to look at the employment rate, which measures people with jobs as a percentage of the population (over 16 years old and excluding prisoners.) At 60.4 percent in February, that rate is still well below the level it was at before the 2008 financial crisis. That would imply that there are still a lot of people who could enter the jobs market. Advertisement But our colleague Ben Casselman, who covers economics, has devised an adjusted employment rate that readers might find interesting. How did you adjust the measurement of the employment rate – and why did you make your tweaks? Let me start with the “why?” The employment rate is great in that it avoids all the issues that bedevil the unemployment rate in terms of deciding who should “count” as unemployed. But the problem is that it’s too broad. It includes a huge group of people who no one would expect to work, namely retirees. And that group is growing rapidly because baby boomers are aging. So if we want the employment rate to tell us anything meaningful about the state of the economy, we have to account for that big demographic trend in some way. One easy way to do this is to look at the employment rate among so-called “prime-age” workers, those ages 25 to 54. That excludes both retirees and most college students, which means it filters out a lot of the demographic noise in the employment rate. The problem is, it filters out a lot of valuable information, too. Lots of 55-year-olds work! And indeed, 55-year-olds are much more likely to work now than they were a generation ago. My calculation, which borrows from an approach used by economists (and occasional Upshot contributor) Ernie Tedeschi, adjusts for demographic shifts by controlling for age and sex. It essentially asks, “What would the employment rate look like today if the U.S. population still had the same demographic profile as it did before the recession?” What does your adjusted employment rate tell us about the jobs market right now? By my calculation, the demographics-adjusted employment rate was at 62.8 percent in February, which is almost exactly where it stood in December 2007, which was the first month of the recession. But it’s still significantly below where we were in 2000, the last time the unemployment rate got this low. Can we use your adjusted employment rate to get an idea of how much slack is left in the labor force? Yes, but it doesn’t give a definitive answer. What it tells us is that the employment rate has fully recovered from the recession. It doesn’t necessarily mean that all the slack is gone. Let me expand on that slightly. Between the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the peak of the housing bubble in 2007, the age-adjusted employment rate fell by about a percentage point. There are two reads on that. One is that the job market just never got as good in the mid-2000s as it did in 1999 and 2000. The other interpretation is that there has been a fundamental shift in the economy, and for some set of reasons — technology, globalization, video games — the share of Americans who are willing or able to work has fallen. Advertisement If you buy that second story, then the fact that the age-adjusted employment rate is back to prerecession levels should tell you that we’re basically at full-employment today. The slack is gone. This is as good as it gets. But I would argue the last couple years should lead to significant skepticism about this kind of structural-change thesis. The labor force has grown dramatically over the last few years. Job growth has continued unabated. Unemployment rates for marginalized groups such as black Americans have fallen sharply. And this has all happened in an environment where wage growth has been sluggish, which suggests that employers are able to attract workers without boosting pay, at least by much. All of that suggests that there are still people out there who are willing to work if opportunities become available. I don’t know if we can get back to that 2000 employment level, but today’s report suggests we can at least keep moving in that direction. • Joseph Song and Michelle Meyer, BofA Merrill Lynch: Today’s “Goldilocks” report suggests the business cycle still has another leg to go: the labor supply is increasing to meet the gain aggregate demand, preventing price pressures from building too aggressively. • Ellen Zentner, Morgan Stanley: Straight lines don’t exist in economics. Despite the move lower in the year-over-year pace of average hourly earnings (AHE), the underlying trend in wage growth continues to firm, in line with continued tightening in the labor market and rising productivity. • Joe Brusuelas, RSM US: “The job market continues to sizzle as the economy is in the early stages of absorbing a late cycle fiscal boost that will support a growth rate well above the long-term trend in 2018. The 313,000 job gain is more than triple that necessary to meet the demand of new entrants into the work force, which if it sustained will continue to put downward pressure on the unemployment rate. This will not be lost among an F.O.M.C. that leans hawkish in 2018 and points toward an increasing probability that the central bank will hike rates four times this year. How strong is this labor market? The increase of 806,000 in the labor force and 785,000 in the household employment estimate are robust and statistically significant, which is a rare two-for in the monthly labor report. This labor market is on fire and wage gains are in train.” • James Ingram, MB Capital: “February’s fall in average wage rise data takes some of the pressure off. But the creation of more than 300,000 jobs in February suggests it will return in the months to come. Throw in a potential trade war between the US and the EU and the US economy could be headed for a perfect inflationary storm later this year. An interest rate hike in March from the US Fed must now be all but nailed on.” Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . • Capital Economics: “We suspected that the flu epidemic and the unseasonably cold weather in January had depressed payrolls, but even we were caught out by the strength. Illness and weather also affected the earnings and hours worked data in January, with those effects unwinding in February.” Specifically, Ms. Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, is interested in the loans Apollo and Citigroup extended to Jared Kushner’s family real estate firm, reports Politico’s Playbook. Ms. Warren, along with Representative Elijah Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, Senator Tom Carper, Democrat of Delaware, and Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, sent letters to Apollo (the letter) and Citigroup (the letter) asking: “For the dates the loans were offered, conditions of the loan and a description of the process by which the Kushner Companies got the loans. It asks for ALL MEETINGS between the two firms and Kushner, and various details about those meetings. They request ALL DOCUMENTS from the loan process and whether any of the loans included foreign financing.” Context The New York Times reported last week that:  • Josh Harris, a founder of Apollo Global Management, was advising Trump administration on infrastructure policy last year and met with Mr. Kushner several times. Among other things, the two men discussed a possible White House job for Mr. Harris, which never materialized. In November, Apollo lent $184 million to Kushner Companies. The loan was to refinance the mortgage on a Chicago skyscraper Advertisement • Michael Corbat, Citigroup’s C.E.O., met with Mr. Kushner in the spring, and shortly afterward the bank lent Kushner Companies $325 million. Stephanie Clifford of the NYT reported: Martin Shkreli, a former pharmaceutical executive notorious for sharply increasing drug prices, mounting sneering defenses of his actions and even issuing a bounty for one of Hillary Clinton’s hairs, was sentenced on Friday to seven years in prison after being convicted of fraud last year. Last summer, a jury convicted Mr. Shkreli, nicknamed Pharma Bro, on three of eight counts , concluding that he had lied to investors about, among other things, how the hedge funds were managed, what they invested in and how much money they had. The jury found that he had also secretly controlled a huge number of Retrophin shares. Prosecutors had sought a sentence of at least 15 years; the defense had pushed for 12 to 18 months. Ben Sisario of the NYT writes: When Martin Shkreli, the disgraced former pharmaceuticals executive, is sentenced for securities fraud in Brooklyn on Friday, the government will have its pick of a number of his assets to satisfy the $7.36 million judgmentagainst him. There is a brokerage account with $5 million in cash, shares in his company Vyera Pharmaceuticals, even a Picasso. And then there is an item that has been the subject of worldwide intrigue: the sole copy of the Wu-Tang Clan album “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin,”packaged in a custom silver-and-nickel case and accompanied by a 174-page leather-bound book. It may be the most famous album ever kept in the possession of just one person. But what is it worth? The answer? It is complicated, though experts all doubt that the album could yield anywhere near the $2 million Mr. Shkreli apparently paid for the album at auction three years ago. President Trump authorized tariffs on imported steel and aluminum yesterday, defying allies and Republicans alike. But as Peter Eavis notes, the presence of exemptions for Canada and Mexico show more wiggle room than expected: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has leeway to exempt certain steel and aluminum imports from the restrictions if he determines that the United States lacks the capacity to produce them. There is also a national security exemption, notable since national security concerns are the legal basis for the tariffs. And Neil Irwin of the Upshot reckons that while we’re seeing a trade skirmish, it won’t necessarily become a trade war. (He also thinks it’s partly a negotiating tactic in the Nafta talks.) That hasn’t stopped trade partners  protesting. And in its lead editorial, The Economist wrote, “Not since its inception at the end of the second world war has the global trading system faced such danger.” The other China trade story: Mr. Trump tweeted that he has asked Beijing to reduce its trade deficit with the U.S. by $1 billion, adding, “We must act soon!” Elon Musk subsequently beseeched him on Twitter to tackle China’s restrictions on auto imports.

Mr. Navarro isn’t in the lead — other candidates include a top lieutenant to Mr. Cohn, Shahira Knight — but can’t be counted out.

(Politico) Behind Cigna’s $67 billion (with debt) acquisition of Express Scripts is the idea that health insurance on its own is a challenged business. The C.E.O.s of the two companies said the union would help lower costs. But it’s also meant to help Cigna counter both UnitedHealth, the giant of the industry, and a combined CVS and Aetna. There’s skepticism: Cigna’s shares fell 11 percent yesterday. Matthew Borsch of BMO Capital Markets said that investors had hoped the insurer would buy something other than a business “under pressure, under scrutiny and to some degree in decline.” About that pressure: The F.D.A. has shown interest in lack of competition among drug benefits managers. David Balto, an antitrust expert, told the NYT, “History has shown where there are multiple mergers going on in a single industry, the Justice Department goes on high alert.” Advertisement Critics’ corner: Charley Grant of Heard on the Street writes, “Cigna has increased its vulnerability to industry changes rather than reduced it.” And Lex says of Express Scripts’ industry, “Like Seth Rogen comedies, they are a U.S. institution whose utility eludes other nations.” The deals flyaround • Toys “R” Us, yet to find a buyer, is preparing to liquidate its U.S. operations, unnamed sources say.

He’s also drawn interest from Apple and Amazon. Our questions: • How much would Netflix pay? Remember that it gave the showrunner Ryan Murphy $300 million for a five-year content deal. The Obamas already signed book deals reportedly worth $60 million. • While Mr. Obama doesn’t intend to take on his successor directly, will his likely choice of topics — like health care, immigration, voting rights — be seen as a counter to President Trump anyway? Elsewhere in media: The actor and producer Michael B. Jordan will adopt the use of “inclusion riders” in his production company’s projects. Disney will add a live-action “Star Wars” series to its forthcoming streaming service, to be directed by Jon Favreau. And Disney shareholders voted down a nonbinding endorsement of Bob Iger’s pay package. While the now nine-year-old bull market may still have some legs — even if it isn’t likely to top last year’s performance — there’s more for investors be anxious of. Not so for traders.

 ZURICH —  Upmarket social network ASMALLWORLD is listing on the Swiss stock market next week in a deal that could value the company at 79.3 million Swiss francs (59.84 million pounds)it said on Thursday. The Swiss company that has been dubbed the ""Myspace for millionaires"" or ""Facebook for rich kids"" said it will not be selling new shares when it starts trading on Tuesday because it does not need more cash to grow. Instead, the Zurich business, which requires new members to be invited by an existing member or be approved by a committee, said it was listing to generate publicity. ""We're excited to become the first social media company to be listed on the Swiss exchange,"" said Chairman and majority owner Patrick Liotard-Vogt. The Swiss businessman is the grandson of former Nestle CEO Pierre Liotard-Vogt and is a regular in Swiss society pages. Advertisement ""With the listing we can raise the visibility and boost strategic options,"" he added. About 8.1 million shares will be listed, the company said, citing what it called a ""reference price"" of 9.75 francs per share, with a free float of at least 40 percent. Advertisement WEINSTEIN At a news conference on Thursday, Liotard-Vogt told Reuters he bought his stake in 2009 from disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who faces lawsuits after being accused of sexual harassment and misconduct by Hollywood actresses including Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie and Ashley Judd.  . Weinstein, who denies having non-consensual sex with anyone, sold his stake nearly a decade ago amid a reorganisation in which the producer was focusing on his movie assets, Liotard-Vogt said.

 NEW YORK —  A long rally in technology stocks has left investors thirsting for more, but that could be a mistake as the strengthening U.S. economy points to better value in other stocks. Heavyweights like Apple, Alphabet and  Facebook have especially helped growth indexes in the past year rise more than value indexes, which right now are heavily weighted in financials. Tech so far in 2018 is the best-performing sector too, leading the recovery from the market's steep selloff in early February, with the Nasdaq hitting record highs again in recent sessions. That's reflected in the performance of major benchmarks for portfolio managers, including the Russell 1000 growth index, up 6.1 percent so far this year, compared with the Russell 1000 value index, down 0.5 percent since Dec. 31. Advertisement But some money managers are betting that trend may have gone on for too long. They argue that value stocks, which tend to have lower valuations, will look especially appealing relative to growth as the economy accelerates above its historic growth rates. Advertisement ""That growth has continued for as long as it has and as lopsided as it is doesn't mean the world has changed. It means we're overdue for the pendulum to swing back to value,"" said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors in New York. Growth and value are two classic approaches to investing, with growth investors typically searching for companies that have higher profit growth and margins, while value investors look for stocks that seem undervalued. A shift from growth to value could come slowly. Based on Thomson Reuters Lipper data, so far in 2018, U.S. fund investors have been pulling more money out of value funds than growth. CLS Investments Chief Investment Officer Rusty Vanneman, who has already shifted to favoring value over growth, said investors tend to chase performance, and ""tech names have been the glamor names."" To be sure, many tech stocks do well when the economy improves, and every sector has stocks in both value and growth. Katz thinks banks, energy and some stocks in health care, including Gilead Sciences, make good value buys right now. Helping the argument for value, some strategists say, is a robust economic expansion in the United States. The economy is also being given additional fiscal stimulus through sweeping changes to the tax law approved by Congress late last year, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate.  . Growth stocks mostly have outperformed value since the bull market began nine years ago and far outpaced them last year, when the S&P technology index rose nearly 37 percent compared with the S&P 500's gain of 19.4 percent. Advertisement In 2017, the Russell growth index rose 28.4 percent versus a gain of 10.9 percent in Russell value. ""It's definitely more difficult to find the proper risk-reward ratio in growth right now,"" said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc., an investment advisory firm, based in Toledo, Ohio. (GRAPHIC: Russell 1000 growth vs value since late 2007 - http://reut.rs/2Hy6X5v) The price-to-earnings ratio for the Russell growth index last year hit its highest since 2002. The index is now trading at about 20 times forward earnings, down slightly from recent levels. The value index is trading at less than 15 times earnings, its lowest since 2016, according to Thomson Reuters DataStream data. (GRAPHIC: Russell 1000 growth PE vs value PE - http://reut.rs/2p8TKJS) ""It's a valuation argument. Growth has done phenomenally and the valuations reflect that,"" said Ernesto Ramos, head of quantitative equity strategy at BMO Global Asset Management. Multiples have risen ""across the board,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. But, he said, ""if everything is expensive, value offers a higher margin of safety."" Financials, which benefit from higher interest rates and would get a boost from reduced regulations that are expected under the Trump administration, have the biggest weighting in the Russell value index, accounting for about 28 percent of the index, according to Thomson Reuters data. Technology as a sector has the biggest weighting in the Russell Growth 1000 index, accounting for roughly 39 percent. JPMorgan Chase, Berkshire Hathaway, Exxon Mobil, Bank of America and Wells Fargo represent the biggest weightings in the Russell 1000 value index, while Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Facebook and Alphabet are the biggest weightings in Russell 1000 growth. Besides telecommunications, financials have the lowest valuation of any S&P 500 sector, trading at about 13.9 times forward earnings compared with technology, which has among the highest, at 19.2 times forward earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. The benchmark S&P 500 is trading at 17.3 times forward earnings. With value, ""you're basically trading tech exposure for financials exposure,"" Ramos said.

 (Reuters) - U.S. media company Meredith Corp has hired advisers to explore a sale of its Time, Fortune, Money and Sports Illustrated magazines following its $1.84 billion acquisition of Time Inc in January, people familiar with the matter said. The move illustrates how Meredith sees some of Time Inc's titles that attract primarily male readership as not playing to its core strength in women's magazines, which include Better Homes & Gardens, Family Circle and Martha Stewart Living. The Des Moines, Iowa-based company has tapped investment banks Citigroup Inc and Houlihan Lokey Inc to find potential buyers for the magazines, the sources said this week. There is no certainty that a divestiture will occur, the sources added. While it's possible that media, telecommunications or technology companies could express an interest in the magazines, a sale to wealthy individuals, such as philanthropists or billionaires, is viewed by Meredith as more likely, according to one of the sources. Advertisement The sources asked not to be identified because details of the sale process are confidential. Citigroup declined to comment, while Houlihan Lokey did not immediately return a request for comment. Advertisement ""We are in fact exploring a number of additional changes to the (magazine) portfolio, including divestitures of brands and businesses that might perform better under a different owner,"" Meredith CEO Steven Lacy told investors at a Deutsche Bank conference earlier this month. Time Inc referred calls to Meredith, which declined to comment beyond reiterating that the company is reviewing its portfolio.  . It was not clear how much the magazines could be worth. Fortune and Money generated more than $20 million in 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBIDTA), while Time generated more than $30 million in 12-month EBITDA, according to one of the people. The potential divestitures underscore how Time Inc's primary attraction for Meredith was building scale in digital advertising. With its roots in traditional publishing, Meredith has been in a fierce competitive online race against internet giants such as Alphabet Inc’s Google and Facebook Inc for consumer eyeballs and advertising dollars. The deal with Time Inc expanded Meredith's reach with internet-savvy millennials, creating a digital media business with 170 million monthly unique visitors in the United States and more than 10 billion annual video views. Meredith's acquisition of Time Inc was aided by a $650 million investment from the private equity arm of Charles and David  Koch, the billionaire brothers known for championing conservative political causes.

 A few swipes into the popular dating app Bumble, and the diversity of interests is obvious: Users post photos of themselves swinging from trapezes, playing French horns, posing with freshly caught fish and, occasionally, brandishing a handgun or aiming a semiautomatic rifle. But following a string of mass shootings and nationwide calls for gun control in recent weeks, Bumble is setting plans in motion to ban images of firearms for its nearly 30 million users. The company joins a long list of businesses that have cut ties with the National Rifle Association or sought to clarify their relationship with the industry since a deadly shooting in Florida last month. Some 5,000 moderators around the world will scour new and existing profiles and remove gun-related content, said Whitney Wolfe Herd, Bumble’s founder and chief executive. Bumble will not censor images that appear in users’ Instagram feeds, which can be integrated into Bumble profiles. Advertisement The new policy, which resembles how Bumble already handles nudity, fake photos, hate speech and other transgressions, will extend to dangerous weapons like knives as well as firearms, she said. Users with military or law enforcement backgrounds will be allowed to post photos of themselves carrying firearms while in uniform. Advertisement “We just want to create a community where people feel at ease, where they do not feel threatened, and we just don’t see guns fitting into that equation,” Ms. Herd said. Ms. Herd started Bumble in 2014 to create a “kinder, more accountable” online space where women initiate conversations. The app’s user base has expanded to include a wide range of users, including gun control advocates as well as people who use firearms for recreation and hunting. Ms. Herd acknowledged that most gun owners consider themselves to be hobbyists and do not endorse violence. She said that users — such as competitive sport shooters — could appeal to have their photos restored. “This is not super black and white,” she said. “It’s a very tricky battle we’ve chosen to taken on, but I’d rather pursue this than just ignore it.”  . Bumble has received complaints about gun photos, but Ms. Herd said the new policy was not an attempt to “sweep up a mess” involving unhappy Bumble users. The company, which is based in Austin, Tex., and also operates a networking service for professionals and a friend-matching function, is donating $100,000 toward a nationwide protest against gun violence planned for later this month. “Compared to what’s going on with Facebook and Twitter, we take a very proactive approach,” she said. “If I could police every other social platform in the world, I would.” Bumble’s policy is likely to meet with “significant backlash” from certain users and could even spawn niche dating apps for firearms aficionados, said Sarah Roberts, an assistant professor of information studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. (Some matchmaking services for gun advocates already exist.) “It’s an interesting demonstration of the ways in which apps and social media platforms both reflect and are sensitive to cultural change and serve as a cultural barometer but can also codify what is acceptable behavior,” she said. “They have immense power to make changes like that, seemingly overnight, typically behind closed doors.” Ms. Herd plans to eventually filter out mentions of guns in written content as well. “This is not a politically driven decision, nor a decision driven by hatred of people’s personal beliefs or choices,” she said. “Not everyone’s going to love us for it, but it’s the right thing to do.” Follow Tiffany Hsu on Twitter: @tiffkhsu.

 If headlines about an “Instant Pot recall” or an “Instant Pot meltdown” have been making you anxious, there’s reason for relief. Your beloved pressure cooker is probably fine. Instant Pot, the Canadian company whose electric multifunction pressure cookers became a must-have gift for many over the holiday season, said last week that it had received a small number of reports about overheating in the Gem 65 8-in-1 Multicooker. The company said it would replace the affected models of the device, which is not a pressure cooker. Instant Pot said that the only models of the Gem affected were those from five batches, marked with the batchcodes 1728, 1730, 1731, 1734 and 1746. Customers can check to see whether their Gems were included in those batches by finding a silver label on the bottom of the cooker. The batchcode is on the bottom right of the label. That said, if you do have a Gem in one of those batches, you should stop using it. Instant Pot has assured affected customers that they will be sent instructions on how to receive a free replacement. Advertisement The Gem multicooker, which (perhaps surprisingly) does not include pressure cooking among its eight functions, is not one of the company’s more popular models. It does not appear on the company home page and was introduced relatively recently, a company spokeswoman, Anna Meglio, said.  . She could not immediately answer questions about how many customers had reported that their device had overheated or when the first reports were received. She also did not know how many of the gadgets the company was prepared to replace. Instant Pot has said it was working with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission on the replacement. Advertisement Hip Cooking, a website for fans of pressure cooking, said in an article last month that the recently released Gem was the first model introduced by the company that was not an improvement on earlier devices. The writer, Laura Pazzaglia, cited an Amazon review that pointed out “there was nothing ‘instant’ about slow cooking.” (The review is no longer available online.) Instant Pot, a privately held company, experienced a wave of success last year, as sales of electric multicookers took off. The Instant Pot product was among the top five items sold by Amazon and Target on Black Friday and among the top three best-sellers at Kohl’s. The company told The New York Times in December that the Instant Pot’s sales have more than doubled every year since 2011. Fans of the device — so-called potheads — share recipes on Facebook and on other online forums. So breathe easy, Instant Pot owners. And just make sure you’re cleaning those condensation collectors. Otherwise, you might have real problems. Follow Jonah Bromwich on Twitter: @Jonesieman. We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.

 AUSTIN, Texas —  Since it was founded in 1987, the annual South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, has grown from a little indie, grassroots event that locals barely noticed to a phenomenon that attracts 400,000 people and generates some $300 million in spending. For attendees, it can all be a little overwhelming. How do you know what's worth your time and where the buzz is going to be? In the latest episode of the AP Travel podcast ""Get Outta Here,"" we offer some strategies for conquering FOMO (fear of missing out) at SXSW, along with some other tips for visiting Austin during the March 9-18 festival or any other time. WHY IS SXSW SUCH A BIG DEAL? It's a weeklong music, movie and tech juggernaut. It's 2,000 bands. It's film premieres and TED-like talks about the future of everything from virtual reality to politics to the economy. Participants have included Bruce Springsteen, the Obamas, Mark Zuckerberg. This year's festival includes Bernie Sanders, the premiere of Wes Anderson's new movie, ""Isle of Dogs"" and some type of actual town representing HBO's ""Westworld"" series. HOW HAS SXSW CHANGED? It began as a very insider event in a few clubs over a long weekend where recording labels could discover new and unsigned bands. It was so small in the early days that you could live in Austin and really have no idea it was taking place. But over time the idea of getting ""discovered"" at SXSW crept into the culture and it got bigger and bigger, expanding far beyond music. It's not just a venue for emerging artists anymore. And there's a debate: Has it gotten too big? Has it lost its soul? It's a fair argument to make. There's a lot of marketing and product placement these days. At the same time, there are still 2,000 bands performing. If you can put aside red carpet premieres and megastars, what it was made for is still happening. Advertisement Austin has grown too in the last 25 years or so, from roughly a half-million people to a million. A favorite local pastime is complaining about how much better Austin was 20 years ago, and the sheer size of SXSW brings out the curmudgeon in locals. But others make a buck off of it. You can make good money renting your home or condo, though you might get the stink-eye from your neighbors. Advertisement HOW DO YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO AND SEE? Fear of missing out is this boulder you lug around for the week. Social media amplifies that. You're standing in line, hoping to get into one show, and all of a sudden on Twitter or Facebook, you'll see some big name or maybe someone is rumored to attend or people you weren't expecting to come are playing. Drake famously showed up last-minute a few years ago. One way to create some leeway in your schedule is to let the nostalgia acts go — the former big-name bands that use the festival to promote comebacks. Instead, pack your schedule with artists that are coming into their moment and have their best years ahead of them. Also, you need a plan. You really can't just wing it. That's a lesson you're going to learn fast given the lines to get into the better, buzzy shows. And it's not just concerts: The lines are at premieres and keynote speeches too. Be ready for the lines. But have some backups. And consider venues outside downtown, which will be less crowded. There are film screenings at theaters all over, and bands coming here to promote themselves tend to play a lot of shows.  . PRICES, GETTING AROUND, FOOD Wristbands are around $200 but a badge that gets you priority entry is around $1,000. The tiered system means it's hard to get into the bigger headline events or hottest shows without the badge. Hotels easily run hundreds of dollars a night. Rentals and Airbnbs can be had for less farther away from downtown, but lodging fills up fast. The core of SXSW is walkable but for outlying venues, there are pedicabs, Uber and Lyft among other ride options. Barbecue wars are real here. You might stand on line for three hours for barbecue. Salt Lick is a famous barbecue outpost about 20 minutes south of town but the trendier one these days is Franklin's. ATTRACTIONS Austin is a great town for live music any time of year. It's also a great destination for outdoor activities, with greenbelts, biking and more. Mount Bonnell offers great views, San Antonio is an hour away and it's not far from Texas wine country. Under the Congress Avenue Bridge, at dusk every night, a million bats fly out to hightail it north. It's a pretty amazing sight. ___ Subscribe to AP's ""Get Outta Here!"" podcast and hear the FOMO at SXSW episode:  http://apple.co/2s2ruHY or https://apnews.com/afs:Content:1828240052/Episode-44:-FOMO-at-SXSW ?

T1,2-Mar-18,"Advertisement By JULIE CRESWELLMARCH 2, 2018
 The national debate over gun control is now sweeping up bike helmets and water bottles. REI and Mountain Equipment Co-op, two outdoor retail chains that are also customer cooperatives, said Thursday they were suspending orders for popular items like Bell bicycle helmets and CamelBak water bottles from the company that owns the brands, Vista Outdoor, because Vista also makes assault-style rifles. The move signals an escalation of the stances businesses have taken in the past week in the controversial gun debate since the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., last month that killed 17 students and staff members. The wave of responses started with a number of companies cutting ties late last week to the National Rifle Association, and gained momentum when Dick’s Sporting Goods, Walmart and Kroger announced changes to their gun policies, including halting the sale of firearms to customers under the age of 21. Late Thursday, L.L. Bean joined its retail counterparts, also announcing a minimum age of 21 to purchase weapons or ammunition in its flagship store in Freeport, Me., the only one where it sells firearms. 
            In the wake of this shooting we have reviewed our policy on firearm sales, and we will no longer be selling guns or ammunition to anyone under the age of 21. ^kw         The stance by REI and Mountain Equipment also signals a widening of the goods and products that are coming under scrutiny in the gun debate. In recent years, Vista Outdoor, like other leading gun manufacturers, has acquired brands that are unrelated to their core firearm or ammunition businesses. Advertisement The acquisitions were done, in part, to diversify their revenue sources as gun sales, particularly in the past year under President Trump, have slumped, but also to rebrand, or emphasize, their connection to broader outdoor activities. Advertisement On Friday, the stock of Vista Outdoor was down 7.3 percent at the close of the market. In February, the company reported that revenue for its guns and ammunition business in the most recent quarter had fallen more than 20 percent. But its outdoor products group, which makes up about half of its sales and includes brands like Camp Chef outdoor cooking products, Bollé eyewear and Jimmy Stykes paddleboards, showed modest growth. Likewise, in reporting quarterly earnings Thursday, American Outdoor Brands, formerly Smith & Wesson, said that revenue from its firearms segment fell 40.6 percent, and that revenue from Outdoor Products & Accessories increased of 13.4 percent. In its statement, REI said it believed it was the job of companies that manufacture and sell guns and ammunition to “work towards common sense solutions that prevent the type of violence that happened in Florida last month.” REI suggested it was disappointed with Vista for not coming forward with an approach to finding those solutions. After several days of active discussions, REI said it learned that Vista did not plan to make a public statement, outlining a clear plan of action. “As a result, we have decided to place a hold on future orders of products that Vista sells through REI while we assess how Vista proceeds,” the company said. “Companies are showing they can contribute if they are willing to lead. We encourage Vista to do just that.” Vista did not respond to an email seeking comment and has not issued any public response to the decision by the retailers. But one of its brands, CamelBak, tried to distance itself from Vista’s gun selling operation, arguing in a statement that it was an “incorrect assumption that the purchase of any of our products may support a cause that does not fit the mission/values of our brand.” CamelBak, founded in 1989, is popular with athletes for its packs that allow athletes to hydrate without using their hands as well as its brightly colored water bottles. It was acquired by Vista in 2015 for $412 million. “Our brand falls within the Outdoor Products segment of our company, which operates separately from Vista Outdoor’s Shooting Sports segment,” the company said in a statement. That segment manufacturers a variety of guns, including AR-15-style rifles. On social media, some argued that boycotting brands like CamelBak and Giro would only hurt people making quality products. Others chided REI for what they saw as mixing business with politics.  . But retailers are being forced to respond to the growing call to arms that is racing across the internet. On Twitter and Facebook, lists and petitions are being widely circulated of myriad companies associated with the gun lobby or brands owned by gun manufacturers, urging customers to boycott and retailers to drop them. Advertisement “I only discovered a week ago that my children’s CamelBak water bottles and the Bushnell binoculars that I bought for my 10-year-old who is into birding were associated not only with the gun lobby, but with companies that manufactured assault weapons,” said Sarah Latha, a 39-year-old mother of three who works for the provincial government in Ontario. “It was incredibly disturbing.” On Sunday evening, Ms. Latha put up a petition on change.org demanding that Mountain Equipment stop selling brands owned by Vista Outdoor. It quickly drew more than 50,000 signatures. Mountain Equipment was caught off guard. The cooperative had long sought out products for its five million members that were ethically sourced and environmentally sustainable. As myriad acquisitions occurred in the outdoor goods space in recent years, it had not paid attention to who currently owned the companies and brands. “The ownership links to these products caught us by surprise,” David Labistour, the chief executive of Mountain Equipment, said in an interview Friday afternoon. After reading more than 70,000 comments made in two days through the petition and emails and on its Twitter and Facebook pages, Mountain Equipment reached out to Vista, alerting the company it was suspending further orders of the five Vista brands the retailer carried. Existing inventory would continue to be sold in the store. “Our general purpose is to get all of the brands that we deal with to become advocates in the conversation for the sensible and safe ownership of guns,” said Mr. Labistour, who grew up hunting on his farm in South Africa. “They’re in a tough place, though. They have two very different stakeholder groups.” In an open letter posted Thursday to Mountain Equipment’s members, Mr. Labistour said the decision would not satisfy everyone, noting there were “as many opinions as there are people expressing them.” Mr. Labistour said when it came to consumer activism, he had been fairly cynical, noting there was often a gap or disconnect between what consumers said they would do in a tweet versus what they actually did. But he believes this movement is different. “We’re seeing the industry rally together, and I believe that we can have some influence in starting this conversation about the appropriate ownership and use of firearms,” Mr. Labistour said. “And when it comes to the sale of assault-style and military-grade firearms, that conversation needs to happen now.” A version of this article appears in print on March 3, 2018, on Page A11 of the New York edition with the headline: Not Just Firearms, but Helmets and Bottles, Too.

T1,21-Feb-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin FEB. 21, 2018
 Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • What it takes to be a whistle-blower. • Broadcom whacks Qualcomm for raising its NXP bid. • Untangling the productivity mystery. • How Skadden got involved in the special counsel’s Russia inquiry. Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. Sigmund Freud is reputed to have said that “sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.” The Supreme Court took that approach in deciding what is required to qualify for protection from retaliation as a whistle-blower. A provision in the Dodd-Frank Act defines a “whistle-blower” as someone who provides “information relating to a violation of the securities laws to the Commission.” That seems simple enough, but the Securities and Exchange Commission made something of a hash out of the requirement by taking an expansive view in a rule aimed at protecting an employee from retaliation even if the person only reports information internally. Advertisement In Digital Realty Trust v. Somers, a former employee of Digital Realty, Paul Somers, claimed he was terminated after he reported possible securities law violations to senior management. Although he never alerted anyone outside the company, Mr. Somers filed a lawsuit claiming his termination violated the anti-retaliation provision by relying on the S.E.C.’s rule. Advertisement The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, rejected that reading of the statute. It applied a simple analysis: “Courts are not at liberty to dispense with the condition—tell the S.E.C.—Congress imposed.” By not reporting his suspicions to the S.E.C., he lost the protection afforded whistleblowers. One of the complaints expressed by companies when the S.E.C. considered the whistle-blower rules was that they did not require employees to report information to management first. The incentive created by the Digital Realty ruling is straightforward: Don’t just tell your boss about possible violations; make a beeline to the S.E.C.’s front door, at least if you want protection from retaliation. — Peter J. Henning The Dow Jones industrial average rose 139 points in the half-hour after the Federal Reserve released the minutes of its most recent policy meeting at 2 p.m. and was up more than 300 points on the day. Then the index sank 455 points in the final 90 minutes to close down 0.67 percent for the day. Why? There didn’t appear to be anything in the minutes to make investors particularly bearish or bullish. Perhaps the bond market was to blame for the plunge. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which rises as its price falls, kept climbing after the minutes came out, closing at 2.95 percent. Higher bond yields can make stocks look more expensive, prompting investors to sell. As a result, Wednesday’s mini move indicates that the tug of war between the stock and bond markets is still very much on. While we’re on the Fed minutes, it appears that the central bank’s policymakers did not spend much time discussing an indicator that is flashing a warning sign. The data point in question is the saving rate, which recently sank to a 12-year low. With the rate at 2.4 percent of disposable income, a big drop in the stock market, like the one that occurred earlier this month, could prompt consumers to cut their spending. The Fed’s policymakers did not appear overly worried about the saving rate at their last meeting, which was held before the market’s plunge. The minutes state: In connection with solid growth in consumer spending, a couple of participants noted that the household saving rate had declined to its lowest level since 2005, likely driven by buoyant consumer sentiment or expectations that the rise in household wealth would be sustained. — Peter Eavis Qualcomm defied Broadcom’s demand not to raise its takeover bid for NXP on Tuesday by increasing that offer by about 16 percent, to $127.50 a share from $110. Now Broadcom has retaliated. Broadcom shaved $3 per share off its hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm, to $79. Broadcom’s rationale is that the new NXP offer transfers value away from Qualcomm’s shareholders. From the news release: Broadcom believes that a responsible Qualcomm board could have preserved value by following ISS’s clear recommendation to work with Broadcom on the NXP transaction and negotiate the sale of Qualcomm to Broadcom. Instead Qualcomm’s board acted against the best interests of its stockholders by unilaterally transferring excessive value to NXP’s activist stockholders. Let’s take a look at the math Advertisement • Broadcom argues that Qualcomm gave up $4.10 a share, or $6.2 billion, in value to NXP shareholders. In response, it cut its price. At $79 a share, Broadcom’s current offer is just under 13 percent higher than its original offer. (Of course, other elements of Broadcom’s last bid — the $8 billion breakup fee for antitrust reasons, the ticking fee if a deal takes more than 12 months to close — still stand.) • Broadcom also contends privately that had Qualcomm agreed to start deal talks, the two of them could have held firm against NXP shareholders like Elliott Management and Soroban Capital Partners. By giving up less negotiating power to the holdout shareholders, the argument goes, Qualcomm could have recut the NXP deal at a far lower price. • Qualcomm argues privately that the $4.10 a share is nonsense, since the NXP deal a) wasn’t going to get done at $110 a share and b) will still add to its earnings per share price starting in the 2019 fiscal year. The bet on the shareholder meeting Broadcom had previously said that it would walk away if the NXP offer went above $110 a share, but now seems content to take its chances at Qualcomm’s annual shareholder meeting. Broadcom wants six seats on Qualcomm’s board. That campaign gained momentum when the proxy advisers I.S.S. and Glass Lewis recommended that Qualcomm shareholders vote for at least four of its director nominees. A Qualcomm representative didn’t have an immediate comment. How the shares moved today: Qualcomm’s were down 1.5 percent, while Broadcom’s were up slightly. Shares in NXP — the real winner in this deal saga so far — were essentially unchanged. — Michael de la Merced The deals flyaround • Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason pressed Xerox to pursue alternatives to its complicated deal with Fujifilm. (Reuters) • HNA has borrowed from the private equity firm Pacific Alliance Group, a sign that it may be struggling to raise capital from more traditional sources. (FT) 
            But might the return to full employment fuel a rebound?         FEB. 20, 2018
 An economy is doing well when companies each year manage to become more productive, or in other words, get more output from their employees and equipment. But productivity for years has grown far more slowly than it did in the past, effectively restraining economic growth. This decline has prompted economists to hunt for causes – and the latest big work on the issue comes from the McKinsey Global Institute. The Upshot’s Neil Irwin does a great job of explaining McKinsey’s main finding: The latest wrinkle is that the researchers now believe that productivity growth depends not just on the supply side of the economy — what companies produce and what technologies they use to do it — but also significantly on the demand side. That is to say, productivity advancements don’t happen in a vacuum just because technology is available. They also happen because companies need to increase production to match demand for their goods, and a shortage, either of workers or of materials, forces them to think creatively about how to do so. Little in economics is straightforward, however, and McKinsey’s deep dive prompted a couple of questions. Jaana Remes, one of the authors of the work, was kind enough to respond. Advertisement 1) In its report, McKinsey notes that the slow down in productivity growth was noticeable before the financial crisis. What caused that? And to what degree did those causes contribute to the decline in productivity growth after the financial crisis? This is important because these forces could continue to weigh on productivity. In the years leading up to 2008, the productivity improvements that started in the 1990s with the introduction of information technology were largely complete, Ms. Remes explains. Important new technologies can often take well over 10 years to have a big impact on productivity, she adds. The optimistic take, though, is that we can in the coming years expect to see big benefits as companies further automate, and introduce artificial intelligence. 2) If a sluggish economy can create the conditions for weak productivity, why did France, Spain and Italy, whose economies were anemic in the period under study, have significantly better productivity performances than faster-growing countries? First, the numbers: From 2010 to 2014, labor productivity grew by 1.4 percent a year in Spain and 1 percent in France, well in excess of the negative 0.2 percent rate for Britain and the United States. Why was that? Because Britain and the United States had made superior productivity gains before 2010. That made it harder for the two countries to notch similarly strong productivity growth in the years after the financial crisis. By contrast, France and Spain, which had made far fewer productivity gains before 2010, were able to eke out at least some afterward. Ms. Remes also points out that a big cause of Spain’s post-2010 gain came from a reduction in hours worked. That might be described as the least desirable way to bolster productivity because it implies a reduction in incomes for workers. The most economically beneficial type of productivity gain occurs when output per employee increases as hours worked grow. — Peter Eavis New research posted by France’s central bank, the Banque de France, shows that the largest companies in the United States now account for a significantly larger share of production. This dominance, the paper asserts, could allow the companies to enjoy “monopoly rents,” the term economists use to describe the subsidies companies enjoy if their business is protected in ways that are not available to other firms. “If these firms hold a dominant position in their market, they enjoy monopoly rents and have little incentive to invest in order to increase their productive capacities. This behavior could explain the weakness of investment in recent years, despite the high rates of return on capital.” David Wessel, writing for Harvard Business Review, also recently took a look at whether dominant companies are holding the economy back. — Peter Eavis The largest United States bank by assets announced that it plans to tear down its current headquarters at 270 Park Ave. and build 2.5 million square-foot modern tower in its place. Advertisement The new headquarters has yet to be designed, but it is expected, according to Bloomberg, to be between 70 and 75 stories and house 15,000 employees. The current headquarters was designed in the late 1950s for about 3,500 employees, JPMorgan said. During construction, employees will be temporarily moved 237, 245 and 277 Park Ave. and 383 and 390 Madison Ave., Bloomberg reported citing a person familiar with the matter. The tower would be the first major project under New York City’s Midtown East rezoning plan, designed to encourage office construction in the area. The job recruiting site said Wednesday that it has hired Jim Cox as its C.F.O., as part of a series of high-level executive appointments. Mr. Cox was most recently at Lithium Technologies, a maker of customer relationship management software. Here’s what Robert Hohman, Glassdoor’s C.E.O. and co-founder, said: “We are pleased to welcome Jim to Glassdoor as our new CFO as he brings a proven track record of building and managing financial operations and teams at high-growth technology companies.” Glassdoor also appointed Christian Sutherland-Wong, most recently its general manager of monetization, as its first chief operating officer, and Samantha Zupan, a longtime executive, as its vice president of global corporate communications. — Michael de la Merced The giant law firm’s work for the former Trump campaign manager — who has been charged with several criminal acts by Robert Mueller’s inquiry into Russian election interference — has come into question after a former Skadden associate entered a guilty plea in the investigation. Advertisement More from Kenneth Vogel and Andrew Kramer of the NYT: The interest from prosecutors in what Skadden did for the Ukrainian government is one indication of the wide-ranging nature of the inquiries related to Mr. Manafort. It also highlights the risks associated with advising authoritarian governments overseas, a lucrative sideline among Washington lawyers, lobbyists and public relations consultants. Skadden’s response: It fired the associate in question, Alex van der Zwaan, last year, and is cooperating with Mr. Mueller’s team. Elsewhere in Russian election meddling: Here’s what we still don’t know about Facebook’s role. Chris Hughes, a co-founder, said Facebook must do more to prevent foreign interference. President Trump blamed Barack Obama for not being tougher on Russia. And meet the  oligarch who helped fund Russia’s troll agency. The judge overseeing the Justice Department’s lawsuit to block the $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner denied AT&T’s request to see government communications about the case. He ruled that AT&T had not “made a credible showing” that the White House had singled it out for retribution. More from Cecilia Kang of the NYT: The decision puts a crimp in AT&T’s defense for its $85 billion proposed merger with Time Warner. And it is a big win for the Justice Department, which would like to avoid attention on the role of politics in its decision to stop the deal. AT&T had already agreed to take the Justice Department’s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, off the witness list — but could call him during the trial if needed.

T2,28-Feb-18,"Advertisement By JOHN HANCFEB. 28, 2018
 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, computer and information technology jobs are expected to grow 13 percent in the coming decade, faster than the average for all occupations. That is good news — for your grandchildren. If you are an older adult thinking of making a second career in the high-tech heart of the new economy, however, be prepared to face skepticism as to whether you can even turn on a computer, much less master the latest software. “There are a lot of barriers to older workers moving into that industry,” said the psychologist Neil Charness of Florida State University, who has studied issues related to aging and technology use for two decades. Pervasive stereotypes about older workers, he said, include the perception among employers (and even among many older adults themselves) that “they’re not tech-savvy, and that they can’t learn new things.” Not true. Although aging brains might take a little longer to learn new tech skills, Dr. Charness said, “they can still do it.” Advertisement Some older adults are proving his assertion, not only in mainstream high-tech careers, but also in “tech enabled” positions. These are jobs — often part time or done remotely, with flexible schedules — that do not require an advanced degree in computer science or years of experience but do involve some digital proficiency. Advertisement “That’s an important distinction,” said Sara Sutton Fell, chief executive and founder of FlexJobs, an online service specializing in remote and flexible employment. “These are really viable professional opportunities, especially for retirees.” Following are older adults who have found second careers in jobs in which technology is the common thread, drawing on their backgrounds and experience to flourish in rapidly changing industries. In 2004, when Geri Lafferty accepted a severance package from E-Trade Financial rather than relocate, she wanted a job that gave her more flexibility. “I stumbled on the idea of virtual assistant,” said Ms. Lafferty, now 67, who lives in San Francisco. A new field at the time, this involves working remotely to help small, typically one-person businesses — solo-preneurs, as she calls them — with their administrative and marketing operations. Ms. Lafferty figured her new job would involve doing most of the things she used to do as an executive assistant in marketing. She was wrong about that. “I had to learn a lot of technology,” she said. Her business now thrives. “She keeps up with the changes,” said one client, Lisa Tener, a writing coach based in Saunderstown, R.I., who has worked with Ms. Lafferty since 2009. Ms. Tener said her virtual assistant had mastered “a very complicated and often consuming customer-relationship management platform” to help her marketing efforts. “I am almost helpless with it myself,” she said. Ms. Lafferty, who took webinars and tutorials to learn the latest digital tools of her trade, dismisses the idea that the job is beyond the grasp of her cohort. “You can’t be afraid of the tech,” she said. “That’s what I’ve learned. You really can’t break the computer by pushing the wrong button.” At Manufacturers Hanover bank in the early 1980s, Ann Donnelly was a management trainee involved in the rollout of what was then a groundbreaking new technology: A.T.M.s. When the bank merged with Chemical and later Chase, she ended up becoming a higher-level program manager, involved in many tech-driven initiatives. Advertisement She left the corporate world about 10 years ago and eventually took a part-time job at a Barnes & Noble bookstore in Manhasset on Long Island. Ostensibly a cashier, she has recently been lending her expertise to the store’s management, looking at ways to improve efficiency during peak sales times. Right now, she says, this work — which inevitably involves technology — is on a small scale and informal. She is fine with the situation.  . “I certainly don’t need to run big programs like I did in the past,” said Ms. Donnelly, now 64 and living in Bayside, Queens. “I’d be more interested in helping introduce some younger people to the concept of program management.” (Program managers have been defined as “super” project managers, focused on the strategy and accomplishment of major organizational initiatives.) Although the technology has changed, she said that some of what she experienced as a young manager in a giant financial institution still applies. “There’s a way to manage projects and programs that will always be usable, regardless of technology,” she said. “You have to live that to learn that.” When he was in his 30s, Earl Fong, a San Francisco resident, returned to school to earn a graduate degree in computer science. For the next decade, he worked for software companies on the West Coast before shifting to volunteer and nonprofit work. Among other jobs, he taught basic computer skills for three years in Tanzania. Now back in San Francisco and working as a software developer for the nonprofit Kiva Microfunds, Mr. Fong, now 67, prides himself on being a “code wrangler”: someone who is adept with all kinds of software code. He may be decades older than many of his fellow wranglers, but Mr. Fong says they all face a similar challenge when it comes to staying relevant. “Anybody in tech has to be constantly in learning mode,” he said. Marcy Brown, 65, retired from a career as a paralegal to become a “gray nomad” with her husband, touring the country in an RV. While on the road, Ms. Brown, an Indiana native, started a new career as a transcriptionist. “It was typing depositions, and I’d been in a law office, so I knew the format,” she said. Ms. Brown was not daunted that she would need to become fluent in a professional transcription program to do the job remotely. Her business eventually expanded beyond the courts, and she now transcribes everything from oral histories to college lectures. Although she and her husband sold the RV and now live in what she calls a “sticks and bricks” home in Gravois Mills, Mo., she continues doing her transcription work and has expanded her digital competencies. For one recent legal project, she had to put audio time stamps on portions of the transcription that were inaudible. This required another advanced program that she mastered. Yet she is modest about her tech skills. “I posted a video on Facebook the other day that I made out of photos and music, and someone said, ‘You are so smart,’” she said. “I said, ‘No, it’s mostly trial and error.’” Advertisement William Jones, 55, started his computer career in the 1980s, working in mainframes for a credit card company in his native Birmingham, England. In 2005, he and his wife, Kimberly, made a radical lifestyle change for themselves and their four children. They bought a 76-acre farm in rural Virginia, where they raised free-range pigs. When his children grew older (they range in age from 18 to 24), Mr. Jones decided to return to the tech world. He took an online web development course at the Flatiron School in Manhattan. “I thought technically I could pick it up,” he said. “But I didn’t think many employers would be interested in someone in their mid-50s.” After completing the eight-month Flatiron course last year, he found a job in web development for D’Artagnan, a food company based in New Jersey. Mr. Jones compares the coding he is doing in his new position, and the mainframe code he used to write, to learning German and Italian (Italian, like today’s computer languages, being less formal and rule-bound). Regardless of experience, he thinks many older adults are capable of learning the skills needed for his job. “Intellectually,” he said, “there’s no reason someone my age couldn’t be doing this.” A version of this article appears in print on March 4, 2018, on Page F5 of the New York edition with the headline: ‘You Can’t Be Afraid of the Tech’.
