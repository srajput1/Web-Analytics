T1,2-Mar-18,"Advertisement Supported by By Reuters BENGALURU, India — Middle East budget carrier Air Arabia will add more destinations and could order around 100 narrow-body aircraft this year, thanks to rising demand in Egypt and other hubs, Chief Executive Adel Ali said on Wednesday. The expansion from the United Arab Emirates' only publicly listed airline comes amid rising oil prices and after a year in which Air Arabia's profit increased 30 percent to a record 662 million dirhams (129.7 million pounds), as it flew more passengers and operated more routes. The airline is considering placing new orders for the first time in several years to support future growth. ""It doesn't necessarily have to be a purchase order. The leasing market is pretty good,"" Ali said in an interview in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru. In November, Air Arabia announced a leasing agreement for six Airbus A321neo long-range jets from U.S.-based Air Lease Corp. ""Our technical team and financial team are working with both Boeing and Airbus,"" Ali said. The Sharjah-headquartered airline currently operates an all-Airbus A320 narrow-body fleet of around 50 jets. Ali did not rule out a deal for CSeries jets made by Canada's Bombardier, though suggested a preliminary agreement by an airline Air Arabia now partly owns was no longer valid. Petra Airlines, in which Air Arabia bought a 49 percent stake three years ago, signed a letter of intent with Bombardier in 2014 to buy up to four CSeries jets in a deal worth up to $300 million at list prices. ""Petra as an airline was finished a long time ago. That's history. Everything that was there is gone,"" he said. Petra was rebranded Air Arabia Jordan in 2015 with the opening of Air Arabia's fourth hub in Amman. Ali said Air Arabia would sharpen its focus on Egypt this year as demand increases. ""We see the tourists coming back, trade is coming back. We have slowed down in Egypt for some time now because of geopolitical and economic uncertainties. We now see certainty there,"" he added. The carrier also expects to grow in Russia and some former Soviet states this year. The 2018 FIFA World Cup will be held in Russia, which is expected to spur demand. Air Arabia plans to add more routes in India, Ali said. The airline already operates a handful of routes in the country, a booming aviation market.

 SEATTLE —  Boeing Co is studying its options for further increases in production of its medium-haul 737 jet, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said on Tuesday. ""This airplane is in demand, so we are always studying our options,"" McAllister told reporters when asked at a 737 delivery ceremony whether Boeing was considering an increase in 737 output. McAllister was speaking at a ceremony to mark the delivery of the 10,000th 737, the world's most-sold commercial airplane. Airbus's rival A320neo has outsold the 737 MAX since the transatlantic rivals upgraded their best-selling planes with new engines in recent years. Advertisement Both companies use the popular models to fund other developments, and both have begun preparing suppliers and investors for possible increases in production beyond their 2019 targets of 57 jets a month for Boeing's 737 and 60 for Airbus's A320 family. Advertisement A Boeing executive said in February the U.S. planemaker was seeing upward pressure in production rates. Airbus said last month it was considering raising output to 70 a month. McAllister said the supply chain would have to be able to accommodate further production increases ""in its totality""  before Boeing took a decision on whether to increase output. He said Boeing was still pondering whether to launch a new 220-270-seat mid-market jet, but had not made any decision.  . Watched by hundreds of employees at the Renton plant outside Seattle, Boeing handed its 10,000th 737 - an upgraded 737 MAX 8 model - to its largest customer, Southwest Airlines. ""My advice is hang around, we have got more coming,"" McAllister told employees, noting demand for the jet which has flown 23 billion people since entering service in 1968. Employee David Knowlen, 74, witnessed the first 737 roll out of a hangar once used to build B-17 bombers near downtown Seattle more than 50 years ago, when Boeing's upcoming 747 and the supersonic Anglo-French Concorde were making headlines. Since then, it is the small narrowbody jets like the 737 that have dominated aviation's spectacular growth. ""The company was smaller then. Everyone's view was that in 10 years everyone would be flying supersonic,"" he told Reuters.

 (Reuters) - Boeing Co is doubling down on its landmark new strategy designed to muscle in on the business of maintenance providers by making its next jet the laboratory for in-house services that could radically alter the global business model for selling planes. Unlike Boeing's last all-new design, the 787 Dreamliner, its proposed new mid-market plane will not bring a flood of revolutionary technical designs to the drawing board. But it will give the world's largest plane maker a chance to test its new business approach of designing the plane so that it generates lucrative services revenues for Boeing while also offering efficiencies to airlines over the aircraft’s decades-long lifespan. Along with production costs, the new approach could help Boeing decide whether to invest the $15 billion or more in development needed to build the jet. Advertisement ""If we decide to launch, it's a big investment and it's an investment that has to contemplate not only the product itself but all of our other strategic objectives,"" Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Reuters. Advertisement ""So you can imagine we would want to look at this airplane through the lens of lifecycle value as we are growing our services business,"" he said. Until recently, Boeing and Europe's Airbus sold planes with little involvement in the way they were operated and maintained. Instead, that was work carried out by their own suppliers or third-party shops. Heavy outsourcing on jets like the 787 expanded the trend by leaving suppliers - such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which supplies the 787's carbon wings - in command of key components. While Boeing and others squeezed their balance sheets to launch jets, many of their suppliers used their design influence to forge profitable relationships directly with airlines as they conducted part swaps or repairs required by regulators. ""That seems a little out of balance, doesn't it?"" said Muilenburg, describing how the pendulum is now swinging back to give Boeing more control over parts and therefore the stream of aftermarket services that comes with owning a part's design. ""We do take the majority of the risk in developing new products, and we think that would cause us to want to gain the financial benefit of that risk-taking for the long term,"" he said. The long-term approach to the new jet is the latest evidence of changes in the $180 billion aero-aftermarket as planemakers jostle with suppliers - and even airlines - for control of repairs, training and data in pursuit of higher margins. Advertisement Last year, Boeing centralized services formerly spread across the company in a new division with a goal to more than treble sales to $50 billion in a decade. The new unit posted operating margins of 15.4 percent last year, compared with 16.1 percent that United Technologies Aerospace Systems, a major supplier, earned from selling new equipment, services and aftermarket parts. ENGINEERING DEPTH The aftermarket is not entirely new to Boeing, and is common in defense, where Muilenburg ran services between 2008 and 2009. Airbus set ambitious internal targets last week and Canada's Bombardier Inc is banking on maintenance.  . But after airplane demand peaked since 2014, Boeing has turned more aggressively to parts and services to help meet a target of doubling margins to the mid-teens by 2020. Its core jet margin widened to 9.6 percent last year from 3.4 percent in 2016. To support the strategy, Boeing is bringing back key in-house technology like avionics - the brains of a modern jet -partly with an eye to future aftermarket revenue. ""It is important that we build out vertical capabilities that sustain our engineering depth...as airplanes become more digital,"" Muilenburg said, adding that broader growth in the industry would also provide a boon to suppliers. Suppliers say Boeing is also less willing than before to share risks - and profits - with them on the systems they do build. Instead it wants them to build to Boeing's designs rather than leaving them with keys to the all-important aftermarket. Already, there are signs the mid-market jet could see a swing away from risk-sharing towards straight procurement deals,the head of a major supplier told Reuters. ""It depends on the area of the airplane we are talking about but we are very clear in our intent to grow our services business, and part of that is bringing back inside some engineering and intellectual property,"" Muilenburg commented. Advertisement The downside of doing more by itself, suppliers and analysts say, is that Boeing could weaken access to outside innovation, import risk and tie up capital and finite engineering resources. Depending on how far this goes, industry sources say it may also herald gradual changes in patterns of cash generation. While planemakers get paid on delivery, engine makers charge little upfront and make money on services provided over years. Some analysts say new plane manufacturer strategies suggest those business models could start to converge and put pressure on them to be more generous with discounts on jets. Muilenburg declined to address pricing directly, but acknowledged Boeing's cradle-to-grave services strategy could have some impact on the timing of future income. ""The services business tends to be accretive to margin, but this does give us the flexibility of where we drive margin in the business with the idea of raising the bar overall,"" he said when asked if bundling services could lead to bigger jet discounts.

 CHICAGO —  The head of Boeing Co said on Thursday the U.S. planemaker can absorb transactions on the scale of a proposed tie-up with Brazil's Embraer without putting at risk internal investments in its business or returning cash to shareholders. Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also told Reuters in an interview that Boeing was ""making progress"" in talks with the Brazilian aerospace company. It continues to study a number of possible structures for a deal, which some outside analysts have said could value Embraer at $5-6 billion. ""Acquisitions of the scale of Embraer are not only very doable for us, they are also things we can selectively do, aligned with our (cash deployment) strategy,"" Muilenburg said. ""We have plenty of cash horsepower to do all three things: invest organically, return to shareholders and then make these targeted acquisitions,"" he added. Advertisement Boeing is targeting operating cashflow of $15 billion and combined research & development and capital expenditure of $5.9 billion this year. It has pledged to return 100 percent of free cashflow to shareholders. Advertisement Brazilian President Michel Temer is weighing a proposal for the two companies to forge a commercial aviation venture, his office said last week, after the government opposed an outright takeover of Embraer which also builds military aircraft. ""We are not done yet; there is still work to go. But we are making progress so I am hopeful that we can complete it,"" Muilenburg said, reiterating the deal was not a ""must"" for Boeing. ""We continue to evaluate all parts of the enterprise, different potential ownership structures"" that range from support to full ownership, he said. Boeing shares closed up 0.5 percent at $348.73. Asked whether such overseas tie-ups were more difficult with rising protectionist sentiment, Muilenburg said Boeing would not let up on its global expansion which, if done strategically, would increase jobs in the United States and abroad. OPEN TRADE Speaking in his 36th-floor Chicago office with views across to Lake Michigan, Muilenburg declined to be drawn on the issue of steel and aluminum tariffs just prior to U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement about them on Thursday. He reiterated his longstanding general support for open trade. ""Our position is we want free and open trade, good solid global trade is good for our business and we are going to be strong proponents of that,"" he said.  . Muilenburg downplayed concerns of a backlash from China, which has ordered thousands of jets. Boeing plans to open a new aircraft completion plant in China. ""You see some tough rhetoric but when I look below the surface, and having talked with both President Trump and President Xi (Jinping), I think there is a true desire to have a productive trade relationship between the two countries,"" he said. Advertisement Muilenburg said Boeing had not decided whether to appeal after losing a price dumping case against Canada's Bombardier but would sue again if provoked to do so again. He said Boeing was in ""no rush"" to decide whether to launch a new mid-market jetliner, which could enter service in 2024-25. ""It is a decision we will probably get to over the next year or so,"" he said. The jet is expected to pioneer an advanced production system for Boeing, which is already building on record output of its smaller 737s, Muilenburg said, noting that suppliers are keeping up with demand. Asked about engine makers, most of which have faced technical or management problems in recent years, Muilenburg said: ""It is certainly something we are keeping an eye on. I will say that despite some of the challenges you have seen out there, our engine partners have been doing well on our commercial programs."" Boeing's biggest supplier, General Electric Co, is undergoing a corporate makeover after heavy losses, but it is delivering engines on time for the 737 MAX through its CFM venture with Safran of France, Muilenburg said. Airbus has voiced concern about delays in similar CFM engines. GE, whose stock was the worst performer in the Dow Jones industrial average last year as Boeing led the index higher, is coping well with the development of a new engine for the 777X jet, he said. ""While it is an area to watch, I feel comfortable with where we are at,"" Muilenburg said.

 Montreal —  With its new long-range business jet just preparing to take flight, Bombardier is banking on sales of new products and maintenance packages to help it drive promised double-digit revenue growth for its aftermarket service business this year. Bombardier, which considered bankruptcy in 2015 after facing a cash-crunch, is in the middle of an aggressive turnaround plan that leans on the delivery of its new long-range, Global 7000 business jet to achieve a 25 percent jump in total company revenues to $20 billion by 2020, compared with 2017. But with demand now flat for other jets and the new Global 7000 just starting to come off the line this year before picking up the pace in 2019 and 2020, Bombardier is counting on upside from the so-called aftermarket business of servicing existing jets. The Canadian company expects its business jet division will, by year's end, maintain 35 percent of the 4,700 in-service jets it has sold over the years, up from 25 percent in 2017, according to Bill Molloy, vice president, aftermarket sales and commercial strategy of Bombardier's business jet division. Advertisement That will help generate double-digit revenue growth this year from such aftermarket services, which it expects will rise by $500 million in total through 2020, he told Reuters. Advertisement Bombardier does not disclose revenue figures for its aftermarket services business, but total revenues from Bombardier’s business aircraft are expected to grow to $8.5 billion in 2020, up from $5 billion in 2017. New requirements for global positioning systems in planes, along with demand for improved avionics, faster internet service and other offerings, are expected to draw in more customers for its jet maintenance. ""You bring the aircraft into your facility and then you've got the opportunity to apply your modifications and upgrades,"" Molloy said. Meeting those new aftermarket targets is possible given Bombardier’s recent investment in that side of the business – which is already a mainstay for the likes of Boeing Co and other plane makers. Bombardier expanded its facility network by a third to 1.5 million square feet, introduced about 30 new product upgrades in its maintenance centers this year and is set to unveil about a dozen more services - including new cockpit displays and global positioning system installations required by U.S. and European regulators. It also plans to double capacity within the next 18 to 24 months in Florida, a geographically strategic location which serves customers from both the United States and Latin America, while also eying future growth in Asia, Molloy said. ""Maintenance is a very important driver” of revenues, said Molloy. Bombardier is expecting greater demand from customers for ADS-B out, which broadcasts the plane's position and will be required by U.S. and European regulators in 2020.  . The demand potential is significant for Bombardier and other jet service providers because according to January 2018 data from the Federal Aviation Administration, only about a third of U.S.-registered business jets and general aviation turboprops currently meet the new regulations. Advertisement While the ADS-B is one of many new service offerings, the expectation is that it will spur more customers to bring their planes back, and then combine the visit to Bombardier's centers with more lucrative scheduled maintenance and upgrades. ""You bring the aircraft into your facility and then you've got the opportunity to apply your modifications and upgrades,"" said Molloy. The company will further expand its global network of nine service centers by 2020 and expects higher demand for installations next year as owners rush to meet the 2020 aircraft ADS-B installation deadline in the United States and Europe. ""I can see the mad scramble in 2019,"" Molloy said in an interview. A 2019 bottleneck could result because some plane owners are delaying their installations with the hope that ""lower cost options will be available in the next 6-9 months,"" said Warren Peck, president of Phoenix Rising Aviation, an Oklahoma-based maintenance and repair operation specializing in Dassault Aviation SA Falcon jets. Ron Smith, a sales manager for business and general aviation at supplier Honeywell Aerospace, said by phone that some installers are already having ""bandwidth limitations to accommodate all the people who are trying to update."" Honeywell, which makes some of the equipment used to install ADS-B, has seen about a 20 percent increase in those orders during the first two months of 2018, compared with the same period a year earlier. The U.S. and European directives follow similar regulations in Australia. And now Canada is weighing whether to add an ADS-B requirement, which could start as early as 2021, said a spokesman for NavCan, the operator of the country's air traffic control services. Molloy said Bombardier is taking steps to prepare, including keeping enough parts and staff, in anticipation of an influx demand fueled by ADS-B requirements next year.

 PARIS —  Boeing Co on Monday ruled out reviving its dormant 767 passenger plane as it continues to ponder options for a potential new niche in the middle of the aircraft market. ""Bringing back the 767 (passenger version) - I just don't see it,"" Randy Tinseth, vice-president of commercial marketing, told reporters on a conference call. There has been some speculation Boeing would revive the 767 wide-body passenger line to offer airlines a low-price backstop in case a proposed brand-new mid-market plane suffered delays, or in case Boeing decided not to go ahead with that project. Boeing continues to target 2024-25 for entry into service of a possible family of jets with 220-270 seats, designed partly to replace single-aisle 757 and some wide-body 767 models. Advertisement ""If it goes beyond that (date), that would be a challenge as (airlines) do have to replace those '57s and '67s,"" Tinseth said. Advertisement Boeing says it is examining the business case for such a jet. Tinseth declined to say when it might make a decision, but industry sources say it could start offering the jet this year. ""We continue to make progress on the program. Things around configuration are coming together,"" Tinseth said, adding Boeing had not decided whether to offer two engine choices or stick with a single engine maker, as on its 737 and 777. The mid-market plane would offer 40 percent lower costs per trip than some wide-bodies - although with shorter range - and it would offer airlines 30-40 percent more revenue than a single-aisle jet ""with little or no additional cost"". Airbus says its largest single-aisle, the A321neo, has already scooped up demand in the market above 200 seats.  . Tinseth said Boeing was meanwhile making progress in filling a production gap between the current 777 large wide-body model and its proposed 777X replacement, due to enter service in 2020. A contributing factor is a recent surge in cargo demand. ""There are a lot of aircraft in the pipeline right now,"" he said, adding the wider aircraft market is ""very strong"". That strength coincides with a slew of available capital as new investors flood into the aircraft market looking for higher yields, despite the growing prospect of interest rate rises. ""The asset class is real. It's not a niche class any more,"" Tim Myers, Boeing Capital Corp president, said on the same call. Advertisement ""We are in the most liquid financing environment I have ever seen in the industry."" Myers said Boeing was in talks with countries representing some of its suppliers to help provide last-resort export funding as the U.S. Export Import Bank remains offline for large deals, due to delays in the confirmation of top officials. Boeing is discussing potential funding with Australia after Britain and Italy stepped up last year, but Myers said it was nonetheless ""extremely important"" to unblock EXIM, which served as a valuable buffer against unexpected shocks in the market. Meanwhile, insurance companies could finance 5 percent of deliveries this year, up from 2 percent last year, he added.

 PARIS —  Imminent airline decisions on $10 billion of wide-body plane orders could influence the fate of Airbus' A330neo even before the recently upgraded jet completes flight trials, industry sources said. A Tuesday announcement from Hawaiian Airlines that it had dropped its order of six Airbus A330neos in favor of 10 787-9 Dreamliner jets by rival Boeing was a sharp blow to the suffering wide-body program. American Airlines said in January it was reviewing the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner and shorter-range Airbus A330-900, which is in test flights before entering service this summer. The U.S. airline aims to buy some 25-30 wide-body jets and could make a decision in coming days, one of the sources said. Advertisement ""We are still evaluating our widebody options,"" a spokesman for the airline said. Even Boeing's most vigorous supporters doubt Airbus would give up on the A330neo, which is key for its bottom line, but the contest marks the latest in a series of battles between Boeing's newest long-haul jet in the air, the 787 Dreamliner, and upcoming A330neo - a market-share feud that has consumed the two planemakers for the past nine months or more. Advertisement Level, a long-haul budget carrier recently set up by British Airways owner IAG, is also closing in on an order for about 8 planes in the same segment, the sources said. ""We'll wait and see and we'll take advantage of whatever aircraft is available,"" IAG boss Willie Walsh said on Tuesday. Airbus has had patchy results with the latest version of its money-spinning A330, relaunched in 2014 with efficient new Rolls-Royce engines, and has made boosting sales one of its top priorities this year. A330 family output has fallen to six a month from a peak of 10, making the success or failure of Airbus's only profitable wide-body line a key topic for investors. ""The A330 makes money and generates cash, while absorbing a great deal of overhead,"" said Sash Tusa, aerospace analyst at Agency Partners, adding that its long list of customers was useful to Airbus when it came to marketing other planes. HAWAII SWITCH Jitters over the future of the A330neo became apparent when AirAsia, one of Airbus's largest customers, toyed with the idea of switching to Boeing's 787.  . Its decision to uphold an order for 66 jets, first reported by Reuters, eased pressure on the A330neo but analysts say that could change if it feels too exposed as the dominant buyer.. The last major A330neo order was for 28 planes from IranAir but doubts are growing whether that can be implemented any time soon due to U.S. concerns about a nuclear sanctions deal. Advertisement Industry sources agree Airbus is under intense pressure to win at American, preventing further output cuts and gaining valuable bragging rights in future contests across Asia. Keeping the A330neo in the game would also leave less space for a new mid-market plane that Boeing is thinking of launching as early as this year - a 225-275-seat model that partly competes with the A330 family. An Airbus spokesman declined to comment on specific contests, but said, ""Many campaigns are ongoing, building on the 110 airlines who are operating the A330 family today."" After trouncing Airbus in wide-body sales last year, Boeing aims to seize the advantage by targeting Airbus’s slow-selling A330neo with further sales of its competing 787. Some analysts have speculated Boeing would also revive the passenger version of its 767 as a cheaper alternative to the A330, but an executive ruled this out. But keeping A330neo output to a minimum would leave Airbus increasingly dependent on one model, the much newer A350-900, for its position in the wide-body market - mirroring Boeing's predicament in the Airbus-led narrowbody market. As the two marketing armies chase around the globe to the next 787-A330 dog fight, Australia's Qantas and Air New Zealand could be next to step into the battle, sources said.

 BRUSSELS —  IAG could consider buying more A380s from Airbus if the superjumbo was cheaper, CEO Willie Walsh said, adding that he was also looking at planes for the airline group's new carrier Level. IAG operates the British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus airlines, as well as Level, a low cost unit launched last year which flies between Europe and the United States. IAG already operates 12 A380s, and could be interested in buying more if Airbus improved the pricing, Walsh said, although the airline was not currently negotiating with Airbus. ""The pricing that Airbus has offered in the past is unacceptable to us,"" Walsh said on the sidelines of a conference hosted by industry body Airlines for Europe. Advertisement ""We've said very clearly to Airbus if they want to sell A380s they need to be aggressive on pricing and when they work out how to sell the aircraft, knock on our door and we'll talk to them."" Advertisement Airbus secured the future of the superjumbo when it agreed a deal with airline Emirates in January for up to 36 A380s worth as much as $16 billion at list prices. For Barcelona-based Level, Walsh said he would need to buy planes to meet a plan to grow the fleet to 30 aircraft by 2022, and would consider a number of different aircraft. ""I think in five years' time, I think there might be opportunities for a different aircraft type,"" he said, suggesting that Level would not just stick to the A330s it currently operates. ""There are Airbus options with the A330-neo or the A350 and as I said more and more we'll see Boeing 787s becoming available at that stage,"" Walsh said, noting that 787s may become an option in the coming years, if their price comes down or second-hand planes become available.  . Those decisions may fall to Level's new chief executive. Walsh said IAG was in the final stages of interviews to appoint a CEO for Level. Among Walsh's other concerns is the building of a new runway at Heathrow Airport in London, where IAG's biggest airline British Airways is based. IAG would be interested in running terminals at Heathrow, Walsh said. The company already runs a terminal at JFK airport in New York and Walsh cited the example of Munich's terminal 2, run as a joint venture between airline Lufthansa and the airport, as a ""good example"" of how this can be done. ""Would I like to run Terminal 5? Absolutely,"" Walsh said when asked about his interest in running parts of Heathrow. Advertisement Walsh has long-complained about the cost of a proposed new runway at Heathrow, and a lack of competition at the airport, and has recently called for Britain to allow other operators to build facilities and run terminals at Heathrow. ""We know how to do it (run terminals) and we know the benefit that that can bring so we're open to doing it,"" he said.

 LONDON —  Britain's Rolls-Royce would be interested in providing an engine for any new middle of the market jet, its chief executive said on Wednesday, if doing so made commercial sense. Boeing is studying a gap between narrow-body jets and long-haul aircraft for a potential new mid-market airplane that could seat 220 to 260 passengers. Rolls-Royce currently specialises in making engines for bigger planes, which carry more passengers. ""We're in the business of selling engines and so naturally we would want to go after that opportunity if it makes commercial sense,"" CEO Warren East told analysts on Wednesday, after the company reported a 25 percent jump in annual profits. ""Strategically it makes perfect sense for us to go after that and that's what we're doing,"" he said.

 GENEVA —  The number of pension funds and asset managers that refuse to invest in nuclear armament makers appears to be growing, although financing is still abundant, an annual survey by anti-nuclear campaigners said on Wednesday. The report, entitled ""Don't bank on the bomb"", found that 22 financial institutions comprehensively prevented any involvement in nuclear weapon producing companies in 2017, up from 18 in 2016 and 13 in 2015. The new names included Norway's Government Pension Fund, Australia's Future Super, U.S.-based fund manager Green Century and Denmark's MP Pension, which manages pensions for Danish academics. There were a further 41 institutions that excluded nuclear weapon producers from their investments, but whose policy was not all-inclusive, up from 36 in 2016 and 40 in 2015. Advertisement The report was published by Dutch Christian campaign group PAX and the Geneva-based International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017. Advertisement ""By divesting from nuclear weapon producers, we can make it harder for those that profit from weapons of mass destruction and encourage them to cut the production of nuclear weapons from their business strategies,"" ICAN's executive director Beatrice Fihn wrote in the introduction to the report.  . The report found that 329 banks, insurance companies, pension funds and asset managers from 24 countries invested significantly in the top 20 firms involved in nuclear weapons, such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics. Of the $525 billion invested, $81 billion more than a year previously, more than half came from the top 10 investors, all U.S.-based, led by Blackrock, Capital Group and Vanguard, the report said. The report examined firms involved in producing key components for the nuclear arsenals of France, India, Britain and the United States. The maintenance and modernisation of nuclear forces in other nuclear-armed countries, listed as China, North Korea, Israel, Pakistan and Russia, was done mainly or exclusively by the government, it said.

 LONDON —  Virgin Atlantic's chief executive said he was confident a deal would be done to secure Britain's flying rights after Brexit, as the airline launched an extra legroom economy seat to try to stand out from the crowd amid intense competition. British airlines want to be able to continue to benefit from European Union flying rights after Brexit, and the British government has said it will try to secure an open-access deal, but a recent Financial Times report suggested the UK was encountering problems in its negotiations. Craig Kreeger, the CEO of Virgin, which primarily flies between the UK and North America, said he believed Britain would secure a deal similar to what it already has under the European Union-United States Open Skies agreement. ""I’ve heard from both governments, I remain completely confident that we’re on track, to work, through whatever it takes to have, to be able to fly, in an Open Skies-like way,"" he said in an interview with Reuters. Advertisement Kreeger was speaking as Virgin Atlantic on Wednesday announced that it would refit the cabins of its Boeing 787 Dreamliners to offer a new type of economy seat with legroom of 34 inches (86 cms), bigger than the 31 inch economy offering. Advertisement Virgin also said it would offer an ""economy light"" ticket which excludes checked luggage. It gave no information about ticket prices, with the new seats not available for sale until Spring. The new offering comes amid tough competition on the trans-Atlantic route, with low-cost carriers such as Norwegian Air Shuttle, Canada's Westjet and Iceland's Wow Air all stepping up expansion between North America and Europe. ""There isn't any question that trans-Atlantic flying has been changing over the last few years and being able to offer a new lower fare is something we think will enhance our ability to compete,"" Kreeger said.  . IAG, the owner of Virgin's old rival British Airways, is also in on the action, launching a low-cost long-haul unit called Level last year, while Lufthansa has been expanding its Eurowings brand, and U.S. carriers have introduced fares that don't include baggage or seat selection. Virgin said the refitting of its cabins was underway and the cost of taking out six seats to make space for the new bigger leg room economy class was ""not material"". The new 34-inch legroom seat on Virgin will give passengers an option in between economy and Virgin's premium economy seat. British Airways and Norwegian also offer economy seats with 31 inches of legroom. Both British Airways and Virgin offer legroom of 38 inches in their premium economy, while Norwegian's premium cabin has legroom of between 43 and 46 inches. Last year, Virgin Atlantic said Air France-KLM would buy 31 percent of the airline from Richard Branson's Virgin Group, making it the second largest shareholder after U.S. airline Delta, which owns a 49 percent stake, and reducing Virgin Group's stake to 20 percent. That deal has not yet completed. (Reporting by Sarah Young; Editing by Adrian Croft and Alexander Smith) We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.

 LONDON —  Rolls-Royce said it was on track to meet its 2020 goals after beating forecasts last year, providing evidence that CEO Warren East's plan to rebuild one of the biggest names in British manufacturing was paying off. Shares in aero-engine maker Rolls gained 13 percent to 939 pence on Wednesday, their highest level since November, after its 2017 pretax profit rose 25 percent to 1.071 billion pounds, beating a consensus forecast of 878 million pounds. Rolls had recorded a record loss for 2016. East has been trying to reshape Rolls during his three years in charge after declines in some of its older aero-engine programmes and plunging demand for oil equipment hit it hard. The company stuck to a goal of generating free cash flow of 1 billion pounds by around 2020, despite the impact of a costly programme to repair its Trent 1000 engines. Advertisement ""Looking at today's announcement, we sense the Rolls-Royce story is finally coming of age,"" said Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris, who has a ""Buy"" recommendation on the stock. Advertisement Rolls said it would continue with a cost-cutting strategy, adopted as part of the turnaround, after an earlier plan saved about 200 million pounds over the 2015-2017 period by cutting layers of management and shortening manufacturing times. ""The reality is there is more simplification that we need to do to make ourselves truly competitive and fit for the future,"" East told reporters on Wednesday. He declined to put a figure on savings from this latest plan but said it would remove duplication and result in ""significant cost reduction"". Some 600 senior managers left the company after the initial restructuring. DIVIDEND BOOST? The strong performance in 2017 was driven by a jump in engine deliveries and higher maintenance volumes. Rolls also reported rising sales in its power systems business, which makes engines for use in trains, agriculture and mining. ""We're seeing this as an encouraging set of results,"" East said. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst George Salmon said the performance should convince any investors still sceptical about East's plans and the results raised hopes about the dividend, which the company had halved in 2016 to shore up its finances. ""The chances of Rolls-Royce meaningfully increasing its returns to shareholders in the years to come look much better now,"" he said.  . Rolls paid out 11.7 pence per share for 2017, unchanged from the previous year. ENGINE REPAIRS Rolls would take a hit of about 340 million pounds this year to account for the cost of carrying out repairs on existing engines, primarily the Trent 1000 installed on Boeing 787s. ""Clearly the engine issues are significant,"" said East. ""However, we are being transparent with our customers, we're being transparent with the market. We're prioritising resolving the situation for our customers. We have our arms around the solution."" Advertisement Rolls has said that 400 to 500 Trent 1000 engines were affected by problems with components wearing out earlier than expected, needing extra inspection and maintenance. Air New Zealand, British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Japan's ANA Holdings are amongst those affected. For 2018, Rolls forecast group underlying operating profit of about 400 million pounds, give or take 100 million pounds. At the lower end of expectations that would represent a decline from its 2017 level of 321 million pounds. That broad guidance was issued under a new accounting standard, which changes how the company books earnings on long-term contracts. Another part of East's turnaround plan is the potential sale of the Rolls-Royce's loss-making commercial marine business, the part of the business which designs and makes equipment used in oil and gas extraction. ""At this stage there's no new news, we'll update you when we've got something to talk about,"" Chief Financial Officer Stephen Daintith told reporters, adding that the update could come in May at its annual meeting or in June at an investor day.

 One appointee went from “battleground states” director for the Trump presidential campaign to a role at the State Department that sent him to South Africa to meet with health officials. Another traded in her campaign experience as a field director in Virginia for a federal job promoting nuclear energy sales abroad. And another, who spent four months on the campaign in New York after graduating from college, landed a job as an aide to the commerce secretary with a résumé that included work as a receptionist at an animal hospital and a summer job at a country club’s golf shop. The three newly minted federal employees are among the nearly 260 or so former Trump campaign and inauguration workers who have gotten jobs reserved for political appointees in the administration, according to public records compiled by ProPublica and analyzed by The New York Times. Advertisement In all, more than 2,475 political appointees have joined the federal government since President Trump took office, including at least 187 former lobbyists and also 125 people with ties to conservative think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute, the records show. Advertisement A database of the employees, assembled through hundreds of open records requests, has been posted online by ProPublica. It offers a comprehensive look at how Mr. Trump is influencing the direction of the federal government, beyond high-profile cabinet appointments and other Senate-confirmed posts, and how he has rewarded people who have been loyal to him or share his priorities. Handing out political jobs to former campaign workers, like-minded experts, lawyers and erstwhile lobbyists is a grand tradition in Washington, where, to the victor, go the spoils. Each president has about 4,000 political posts to fill; separately, there are two million civilian federal workers who are largely hired through a competitive process. Just over a year into his presidency, Mr. Trump has yet to formally nominate candidates for nearly 35 percent of the 639 positions needing Senate confirmation, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit group that tracks federal appointments. Mr. Trump arrived at the White House without a large contingent of well-known Washington names at the ready, and some jobs have been filled with people new to government or lacking experience in the fields where they now work, according to a review of financial disclosures. No comparative database exists from previous administrations, but scholars and other experts on presidential transitions say the Trump appointments stand out. “Overall, my reading is that the Trump political appointees have less expertise, in their respective areas, than any presidential administration dating back to at least the Reagan era,” said Thomas E. Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who reviewed the database. Mr. Mann has specialized in federal government studies for four decades and has tracked the process that previous administrations have used to fill political jobs. Lindsay Walters, deputy White House press secretary, said the administration had appointed well-qualified staff. “The president selects the highest caliber of individuals from an array of backgrounds and experiences to fill positions in his administration,” she said in a statement. “We are proud that these individuals — whether they worked on the campaign, conservative think tanks or elsewhere — share the president’s vision that got him elected.” Advertisement Agency officials added that these new political hires had brought value to government. For instance, Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement that Matthew Mowers, the former Trump campaign official who recently traveled to South Africa, provided a “fresh focus and renewed passion for helping women, children and men who are living with H.I.V./AIDS.” Mr. Mowers, who had also worked on the presidential campaign of Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, is chief of staff in the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator. Last month, he tweeted from South Africa, “Great meeting today with Ministry of Health Officials in Johannesburg.” One of the top sources of the appointees has been the presidential campaign, according to the database. Some of the people listed in the database have already left the Trump administration, but it offers a snapshot of those hired for political jobs in the past year. At the White House alone, there have been almost 60 former campaign workers. In addition, about 20 have been hired at the Energy Department, and another 20 or so at the Commerce Department. Some of the Commerce jobs have been filled with people who have extensive experience in government or the private sector. One of them is Mira Ricardel, the under secretary for export administration, whose career includes stints at Boeing, at the Defense Department and on Capitol Hill. During the campaign, she was a consultant to Trump for America.  . Others hired at the Commerce Department had limited work experience. Jonathan Wardell, the aide in the secretary’s office, graduated in 2016 from Stony Brook University in New York. William Reinert, who works in the public affairs office, graduated from Troy University in Alabama in 2016; his résumé cites six months with the Trump campaign and other short-term jobs, including on Capitol Hill. The former campaign field worker who now promotes sales of nuclear energy equipment abroad is Cameron Dorsey, a 2014 graduate of Washington and Lee University in Virginia who also worked briefly for the Republican National Committee and a political consulting firm, according to her financial disclosure form. The Commerce Department did not comment on the experience level of some of its recent hires. But Secretary Wilbur L. Ross Jr. said in a statement that the department sought the best candidates for positions, adding, “It is important that young people show interest and get involved in public service.” At the State Department, political appointees include Taylor Bush, whose title is listed as special assistant. Mr. Bush was a field director for the campaign in Fairfax, Va., and also worked on the inaugural committee and at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. The only other recent source of income listed on his financial disclosure form was a bartending job at the Hamilton Restaurant in Washington. “The work of a special assistant requires someone who has good interpersonal skills, is well organized and who can handle multiple assignments simultaneously,” the State Department spokeswoman said in a statement. “Taylor Bush is a hard worker — he proved himself in these areas during the campaign and, as a result, was asked to join the State Department.” Advertisement The former lobbyists who have joined the administration include some who recently lobbied the agencies where they now work. Melissa F. Burnison, for example, was in February confirmed as an assistant secretary for congressional affairs at the Energy Department. As recently as the fourth quarter of last year, Ms. Burnison was involved in lobbying the department on behalf of the Nuclear Energy Institute, which represents the nuclear industry, according to lobbying disclosures. An Energy spokeswoman said Ms. Burnison “will continue to comply with guidelines, waiver or no waiver.” Without an ethics waiver, she is prohibited from working on issues with which she was previously involved. The administration has granted at least 31 waivers to some former lobbyists and others who had private-sector jobs that overlap with their new federal assignments, according to the database. Among them is Erik Baptist, a senior deputy general counsel at the Environmental Protection Agency. He previously worked for the American Petroleum Institute as a lobbyist on federal regulations related to renewable fuels. The appointees from conservative research and advocacy groups reflect Mr. Trump’s right-leaning politics. The Heritage Foundation tops the list, according to the ProPublica tally, with at least 25 former employees now working for the administration. Next is Freedom Partners, a nonprofit group led by the general counsel of Koch Industries, with 16 people who were compensated by the organization. They are among about 35 Trump political appointees who worked for or consulted with different groups affiliated with the billionaire libertarian brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch. The conservative appointees are spread across the government. At the Interior Department, Ryan Nichols is an adviser in the Office of Water and Science, after coordinating the Heritage Foundation’s work with a group of climate change skeptics called the “Cooler Heads Coalition.” Also from the Heritage Foundation is Steven Groves, who works at the White House after writing forcefully against international agreements in collaboration with groups like the United Nations Human Rights Council. It is an open question whether the tradition of filling lower-level political jobs with people loyal to the president, or at least grateful for a job, has much influence on policy. After all, the 4,000 positions account for a fraction of 1 percent of the federal work force. “Most of them were excellent, some not so good,” said Eric L. Hirschhorn, a political appointee in the Commerce Department during much of the Obama administration. Because political appointees are not subject to civil service rules, he added, there was one advantage if they did not meet expectations. “It was a lot easier to get rid them,” he said.

 BRASILIA —  U.S. companies eager to tap into the fast-growing market for low-cost satellite launches could become the first customers when Brazil's Alcantara space center near the equator opens as a commercial spaceport, executives and Brazilian officials said. Aerospace titans Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp in December visited the Alcantara space center, but the Brazilian space agency's launch site is especially attractive to smaller firms because its equatorial location cuts fuel costs by a third. Still, Brazil's aim of becoming a hot new hub in the space industry will depend on negotiating a technology safeguards agreement (TSA) with the United States to protect sensitive American space launch and satellite technology. Without it, no U.S. rocket can blast off from the South American country. Brazil wants to attract customers by marketing itself as the cheaper alternative to Kourou, the European spaceport in neighbouring French Guiana, which mostly launches big satellites. Brazilian officials are hoping to complete a U.S. TSA this year that would facilitate the opening of the commercial spaceport. Advertisement On Feb. 22, U.S. and Brazilian government representatives, along with space companies from both countries, held a conference call with a White House official who was asked whether the Trump administration would agree to a TSA with Brazil, according to a person on the call. Advertisement ""We are encouraged that Brazilian officials have expressed an interest in working more closely with the United States in the space sector,"" a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council said. She gave no further details. The safeguard accord could be ready this year if the U.S. State Department gets negotiating permission, according to industry representatives. Tucson, Arizona-based Vector Launch Inc, which specializes in small rockets, appears eager to launch from the Brazilian site. The company wants to undercut big payload specialists like billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX by launching so-called microsatellites from small rockets, cutting costs and wait time for clients. ""Our vision is to launch hundreds of Vector rockets into orbit to satisfy the growing market for microsatellites,"" said Vector Vice President Alex Rodriguez, who made a December visit to Alcantara coordinated by Boeing. ""We are closer to the equator and have an excellent site for launching microsatellites,"" said Brigadier Luiz Fernando Aguiar, coordinator of the Brazilian Air Force's space program, comparing the Alcantara site with Kourou. Alcantara has radars, a runway and a seaport to unload equipment, along with plenty of open land to store rockets and build a liquid oxygen plant if needed, he said. A previous attempt at a U.S.-Brazilian space partnership was scuttled in 2003 when the technology safeguards agreement faced resistance from the leftist government of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and was thwarted by Brazilian lawmakers. The new effort is expected to pass easily in a more conservative Brazilian Congress.  . FAST-GROWING NICHE While the market for launches of large geosynchronous satellites has solidified, the Space Enterprise Council, which represents U.S. industry from launch services to satellite manufacturers, has said the expanding microsatellite sector could experience up to 600 launches for satellites under 110 pounds (50 kg) between now and 2022. Advertisement Alcantara could capture 25 percent of that market, according to the council, which has said a U.S.-Brazilian partnership would give both countries an edge in the fast-growing segment. The cost of microsatellites is a fraction of larger satellites options, making them increasingly important for GPS navigation, Earth imagery, surveillance and internet communications. Boeing, which chairs the Space Enterprise Council, is in talks to partner with Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial planemaker and the main player in the Brazilian aerospace industry. SpaceX was not represented on the visit to Alcantara and is not a member of the council, which also includes Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Corp and Viasat Inc. After Brazilian officials last month said SpaceX was on the trip, the company said that was incorrect and that it was not interested in launching from Brazil. Viasat last month entered the satellite broadband businesses in Brazil with an agreement to use capacity on the country's 5-tonne SGDC-1 geostationary satellite launched last year from Kourou and operated by state-run telecom company Telebras. Brazil abandoned plans to build its own rocket to put large satellites in orbit after an explosion and fire in 2003 at Alcantara killed 21 people. The country is developing a smaller rocket for microsatellites that will be launched from Alcantara next year, boosted by engines developed by the German Aerospace Center.
