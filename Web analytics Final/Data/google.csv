 LONDON —  Alphabet Inc's Google said on Wednesday it was banning advertisements for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings, the latest internet company to clamp down on the sector amid growing concerns about scams. Google's action, which takes effect in June and follows a similar move by Facebook earlier this year, sent the price of the best-known cryptocurrency, bitcoin, down more than 10 percent to its lowest in a month. Interest in cryptocurrencies has surged in the last year as their prices rocketed. That growth has spawned online advertising used by hundreds of companies trying to raise funds by launching new coins or encouraging people to trade the virtual currencies. ""Improving the ads experience across the web, whether that's removing harmful ads or intrusive ads, will continue to be a top priority for us,"" said Scott Spencer, director of sustainable ads at Google, on the company's official blog, The Keyword. Advertisement Under the new policy, Google said it would ban ads for cryptocurrencies and related content such as initial coin offerings, crypto exchanges and cryptocurrency wallets and advertisements providing trading advice. Advertisement In January, Facebook Inc said it would ban ads promoting financial products and services tied to cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings because of the risks to users. Regulators across the globe have warned consumers about the risks of investing in crypto markets, but internet companies are introducing outright bans because they worry there is not currently sufficient protection for consumers. ""If an entity such as Google does not feel comfortable with exposure to these cryptocurrencies then it is right that they don't promote it,"" said Chris Keshian, chief executive of $APEX Token Fund, which invests in cryptocurrency fund managers. The CEO of the UK arm of Coinbase, one of the largest bitcoin exchanges, said Google's decision was a positive development that would not dampen demand, although he viewed the ban as too widespread.  . ""The Google ban is perhaps too broad as it is. It should be narrowed down"" to companies that pitch cryptocurrencies as investments promising a return, Zeeshan Feroz told Reuters. The price of bitcoin traded on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange <BTC=BTSP> fell almost 10 percent to $8,201, the lowest since Feb. 12. It was last down 8.7 percent at $8,337.51 Other large cryptocurrencies also fell on Wednesday. Bitcoin has lost about 40 percent of its value in 2018 after rocketing more than 1,300 percent last year. Google also said on Wednesday it would stop ads for financial products like binary options and synonymous products, contracts for difference, rolling spot forex and financial spread betting. Advertisement Companies wanting to promote those products would need to be registered with the relevant financial regulators before they could advertise again. In a separate blog post, Google said it took down 3.2 billion ads that violated its advertising policies in 2017, nearly double the number of ads it removed in 2016.

 (Reuters) - Online platforms such as Google, Apple and Amazon face new European Union rules on their commercial practices with smaller businesses that use their services, as Brussels seeks to curtail their huge market power. The European Commission is drafting a new regulation specifically targeting online platforms such as e-commerce sites, app stores and search engines that will require the companies to be more transparent about how they rank search results and why they delist some services. The proposal seeks to address potentially harmful trading practices by online platforms and a lack of effective redress mechanisms for smaller businesses that use them to reach consumers. ""Online intermediation services can hold superior bargaining power over their business users, enabling them to behave unilaterally in a way that is capable of harming the businesses using them,"" the draft regulation, seen by Reuters, says. Advertisement Tech companies have faced significant regulatory pressure from Brussels, be it over their handling of swathes of user data, how much they pay in taxes or the proliferation of extremist content on social media. Advertisement The proposal was initially meant to exclude search engines such as Alphabet Inc's Google and Microsoft's Bing, but these will now be included given the impact a business's ranking in search results can have on its revenues. The EU's antitrust chief in June hit Google with a record 2.42 billion euro ($2.99 billion) fine for favoring its own shopping service over those of rivals.  . Under the proposal, operators of search engines, app stores as well as e-commerce sites such as eBay will have to specify upfront the ""most important parameters determining ranking"", such as ""specific signals incorporated into algorithms"" and adjustment or demotion mechanisms. The proposal will not force companies to disclose their algorithms but just provide descriptions at a general level explaining ""how and to what extent the relevant ranking mechanism takes account of the quality of the products and services offered"". Online platforms will also have to implement a notice period of at least 15 days for changes to their terms and conditions as well as provide businesses with an ""individualized"" description of the reasons for which they have been de-listed or suspended - for example from Apple's App Store or Google Play. Where companies have their own services competing with other businesses on their platforms - for example Google's own comparison shopping service in Google search results - their terms and conditions will have to include a description of any preferential treatment they give to their own service including access to consumer data and ranking. The proposal is expected to be published in April, after which it will have to be agreed by national governments and the European Parliament.

 The path to fast and affordable online grocery service is littered with obstacles: refrigeration challenges, storage woes and high transportation costs, among others. But the country’s largest retailers are convinced that it will lead to a lucrative and largely untapped market. And they are all rushing to dominate it first. Walmart escalated the competition on Wednesday by announcing plans to expand its online grocery delivery service to 100 metropolitan areas by the end of the year. Orders will be fulfilled at more than 800 stores nationwide and shuttled to shoppers by drivers contracted through Uber, Deliv and other ride and delivery platforms. Customers must order at least $30 worth of goods and pay an additional delivery fee of $9.95; they can receive their purchases in as little as four hours if they put in the request by 1 p.m. The plan puts the world’s largest retailer on a direct collision course with the world’s most powerful e-commerce player, Amazon, which purchased the Whole Foods grocery chain for $13.4 billion last summer and recently announced plans to use those stores to fill on-demand orders. Advertisement Other retailers like Costco, Target and Kroger are also joining the increasingly expensive battle for customers who want eggs and milk without leaving their couch. Advertisement “There is a lot of experimenting going on as everyone tries to figure out that last-mile delivery — it’s a tough economic equation to make work,” said Mike Knemeyer, a professor of logistics at Ohio State University. “But if you can, you’ll have a big head start on the others, and you’ll end up making money not just in groceries but on all of the things that you sell.” The nexus of e-commerce and grocery sales is increasingly appealing to retailers. “The thing that’s great about grocery is that it’s a pure traffic driver — no matter who you are, you need to get groceries every two weeks, which makes it an exception from all the other categories that keep retailers up at night,” said Matt Sargent, a retail expert at the consulting firm Magid. But while the total grocery market is enormous — nearly $1 trillion annually in the United States — many customers still insist on seeing and touching their food in person before buying. Spending on online groceries is currently just $27 billion a year, or 3 percent of the total, according to Forrester Research, which specializes in technology. Controlling costs is another major challenge. Grocery providers have grappled with the expense of packaging delicate produce and meats in ice packs and dispatching fleets of company-owned vehicles from distribution centers staffed around the clock. Even Amazon has struggled. The company launched its AmazonFresh service in the Seattle area in 2007 and tested it for years before expanding it to more than 20 cities. Customers pay $14.99 a month — in addition to their $99-a-year Prime membership — to have groceries sent directly to them. But late last year, the company decided to pull AmazonFresh from some markets. “There’s no question that online grocery has been a challenge for everyone, including Amazon,” said Sucharita Kodali, an analyst at Forrester. “The reason is it’s just really, really hard to get the last mile going.” But Amazon touched off a flurry of activity with its acquisition of Whole Foods in June. In October, Costco introduced a two-day delivery option for dry groceries and a same-day program for fresh goods through Instacart, a delivery service. Target said in December that it would purchase the online same-day delivery service Shipt for $550 million in cash. Advertisement Amazon, which has several brick-and-mortar grocery options in Seattle, said this month that it had begun to offer same-day delivery of groceries from Whole Foods in six cities and would expand the program to the rest of the country later this year. The program is run through Amazon’s Prime Now service, which relies on contractors to make deliveries in their personal cars within two hours of an order being placed. The service is free to Prime customers, but Amazon automatically adds an optional tip. Kroger soon followed Amazon’s lead with an announcement that it would expand the number of cities eligible for home delivery of groceries through Instacart. Walmart’s Sam’s Club division, which said last month it would offer members free shipping of online orders for an annual $100 fee, also uses Instacart. But Walmart said that it would not tap Instacart for the grocery delivery program at its Walmart stores, which it said would reach more than 40 percent of American households. “We’re saving customers time by leveraging new technology, and connecting all the parts of our business into a single seamless shopping experience: great stores, easy pickup, fast delivery, and apps and websites that are simple to use,” Greg Foran, the chief executive of Walmart U.S., said in a statement.  . The company has made substantial investments in its growing suite of online offerings, including a partnership with Google to sell Walmart products on Google Express and the creation of Store No. 8, an internal venture to help develop new online businesses. In the fall, Walmart bought Parcel, a 24-hour delivery service that uses algorithms and leased vehicles to send perishable and nonperishable products to customers in New York City. On Wednesday, Walmart also reiterated that it planned to expand its curbside grocery pickup service to 1,000 more locations this year, in addition to the 1,200 locations where it is already offered. The service allows customers to order food online and collect it at Walmart stores. But Walmart’s e-commerce success has sometimes been fickle — its online sales increased 23 percent in its most recent quarter, less than half the rate of growth in each of the previous three quarters and a performance that sent a ripple of nervousness through the stock market. 
            How customers of some major grocery retailers said they used online ordering.         MARCH 14, 2018
 Walmart’s expanded delivery service requires that customers visit the company’s website or grocery app to place orders. The chain will then have one of its 18,000 personal shoppers collect the selected items in stores. Advertisement Each of those employees — along with the thousands more that Walmart said it would add this year — undergoes a three-week training program that teaches them how to pick the best meats and produce. As specialists, they are paid more than the company’s entry-level workers. Beefing up its grocery delivery service is an “informed gamble” for Walmart, Mr. Knemeyer said — one that will most likely serve up side benefits such as data collection and inroads with young, affluent city dwellers. The chain, long known as a discount retailer, has lately been trying to broaden its appeal. It spent $3.3 billion acquiring Jet.com, a bulk online retailer that Walmart said would give it access to “urban and millennial customers.” In 2017, it purchased the hip e-commerce brands Bonobos and ModCloth. Last month, it unveiled what it called an “Instagram-worthy” collection of mattresses and bedding, available through a separate website. But the supercenters for which Walmart is best known tend to exist on the outskirts of cities and in rural areas. Breaking into metropolitan grocery ecosystems, which often support an already robust network of delivery services for grocery chains and restaurants alike, could be difficult, experts said. And the feature of groceries that make them so attractive to retailers — they are regularly consumed and so must be regularly replenished — makes most consumers unwilling to splurge on them. Walmart’s $9.95 fee on each order is a much more visible cost to consumers compared to Amazon’s annual $99 fee for its Prime membership, which many shoppers set to auto-pay and then forget. “They probably just look at the relatively high delivery fee and get scared off,” said Matthias Winkenbach, director of M.I.T.’s Megacity Logistics Lab. “Walmart would have to do a very good job communicating the overall economics of shopping their everyday low prices versus Amazon.” Follow Tiffany Hsu and Nick Wingfield on Twitter: @TiffkHsu and @NickWingfield.

 (Reuters) - Amid rising trade tensions between the United States and China, President Donald Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports and will target the technology and telecommunications sectors, Reuters has reported. Trump is likely to target Chinese high technology companies to punish China for investment policies that effectively force U.S. companies to give up their technology secrets in exchange for being allowed to operate in the country, as well as for other IP practices Washington considers unfair. China generally contends that as a developing economy it needs to take certain measures to protect its domestic industries from more advanced international rivals. Below are some of the trade barriers that China imposes, which could prompt retaliation from the United States. Advertisement TECHNOLOGY China keeps close control over the use of tech within its borders, including full or partial blocks against many popular U.S. firms including Google, Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc and others. Advertisement The Chinese government has adopted a raft of strict new cybersecurity regulations, which foreign business groups complain either put China off limits or require them to provide sensitive intellectual property for government checks. Local regulators are also tightening rules on foreign data and cloud services, implementing new surveillance measures and increasing scrutiny of cross-border data transfers. Laws that came into effect in June require firms to store data locally. Cloud service operators that want to be in China must enter into local joint ventures with equity capped at 50 percent. Beijing also has a ""Made in China 2025"" plan, which aims to dramatically increase domestically made products in high-tech sectors with major government investment. AUTOS Global carmakers can only operate in China, the world's largest auto market, via joint ventures (JVs) with local partners, with their stake limited to 50 percent, part of a government drive to protect home-grown auto firms. Tesla Inc chief executive Elon Musk said on Twitter earlier this month that China trade barriers created an unfair playing field and that it was ""like competing in an Olympic race wearing lead shoes."" Beijing is spearheading a major push toward electric vehicles with strict quotas set to come into play next year. Advertisement China also imposes a 25 percent duty on imported vehicles, versus a 2.5 percent import tax in the United States.  . BANKING AND FINANCE Foreign financial firms face long-standing equity caps to participate in some services in China, including a 50 percent limit on life insurance and a 49 percent cap on foreign-invested securities broker-dealers. This month, China's securities regulator published draft rules that would allow foreign firms to increase their shareholding in joint-venture brokerages to 51 percent, with full control possible after three years.. In 2012, the WTO ruled China was discriminating against foreign payment card companies, and despite pledging last year to give ""full and prompt market access"" to U.S. payment network operators, no U.S. firm has yet been granted a license. ENTERTAINMENT China has a strict quota system for imported movies, limiting the number allowed to be shown on domestic cinema screens through the scheme to 34 each year. Hollywood producers also get around 25 percent of the box office, compared to nearer 40 percent they received in other overseas markets. FOOD AND AGRICULTURE China bans imports of poultry, poultry products and eggs due to avian flu. It conditionally lifted an import ban on U.S. boneless beef and beef on the bone in June last year. The U.S. has complained about China's price support for domestic wheat, corn and rice. It launched a challenge at the WTO in September 2016, which set up a dispute panel in September last year to hear the case. At the start of 2017, Beijing raised import tariffs on ethanol from the United States and Brazil, the world's top exporters, and slapped hefty punitive duties on U.S. distillers grains (DDGS), a byproduct of ethanol production used as an animal feed ingredient. PHARMACEUTICALS China last year updated its essential drug list of medicines covered by state insurance, opening the door to more imported medicines to treat major diseases including cancer and hepatitis. Advertisement However, slow drug approvals - though getting faster - mean innovative drugs take many years longer to hit pharmacy shelves in the country, the world's second largest consumer of medicines. A major focus on cutting healthcare costs also means that access often hand-in-hand with forced price cuts. RAILWAYS China requires rail equipment suppliers to its domestic train networks, which are among the world's longest, to prove that at least 70 percent of their supply chain is in China.

Could it happen again? • And R.I.P. Stephen Hawking. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday charged Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, with fraud for raising money from investors on the back of false claims about the company’s blood-testing technology. One of Theranos’s main products, called a miniLab, could not perform all the tests the company said it could, the commission asserted. That, according to the complaint, didn’t stop Theranos from claiming that it had a bright future ahead. Advertisement Here are some of the things the commission says Theranos, a private company, did to pull the wool over investors’ eyes. Advertisement It allegedly performed tests on non-Theranos equipment without telling representatives of a pharmacy company that was poised to invest money in the company. Based on Holmes’ presentation, Pharmacy A executives understood that the blood from their demonstration samples would be tested on Theranos’ miniLabs. Holmes never told the executives that Theranos was actually testing some of their blood on modified third party analyzers. Theranos allegedly distributed fake reports by pharmaceutical companies. Investors believed that pharmaceutical companies had written their own endorsements of Theranos’ technology, when the pharmaceutical companies had not. Theranos allegedly made misleading statements about its work with the United States Department of Defense. While Theranos’ technology was used in a D.O.D. burn study, it was never deployed by the D.O.D. in the battlefield, in Afghanistan, or on medevac helicopters. From 2011 to 2014, Holmes had discussions with multiple divisions of the D.O.D. However, Theranos generated only approximately $300,000 from three D.O.D. contracts. Ms. Holmes allegedly told an investor Theranos expected to expand quickly in the stores of a pharmacy chain, but the likelihood of such an expansion was small. Holmes was aware that Theranos’ retail roll out with Pharmacy A was stalled due to, among other issues, some concerns Pharmacy A executives had with regard to Theranos’ performance. The Food and Drug Administration communicated to Theranos that its approval would be needed, but Ms. Holmes allegedly told investors afterward that F.D.A. approval was merely voluntary. Holmes’ statements that Theranos did not need F.D.A. approval or clearance were important to investors because approval or clearance would have been an obstacle in the company’s path to realizing full commercialization. Ms. Holmes allegedly gave investors fake financial results. Holmes also provided historical financial information to one potential investor. In August 2015, Holmes met with a potential investor, during which she provided Theranos’ financial results for fiscal year 2014. These financials showed 2014 net revenues of $108 million, and 2015 and 2016 net revenue projections of $240 million and $750 million, respectively. But Theranos’ actual financial performance bore no resemblance to the financial information Holmes shared with investors. Theranos recorded little more than $100,000 in revenue in 2014 and was nowhere near generating $100 million in revenue by the end of 2014 — Peter Eavis There is an old adage that if it sounds too good to be true, it isn’t. The case filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes describes a litany of falsehoods about a claimed revolutionary method to conduct blood tests that turned out to be pure fiction. Ms. Holmes and the company settled the case, although the former president, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, is fighting the charges. She will pay a $500,000 penalty, return her shares in Theranos, and agreed to a ban on serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years. What makes this case interesting is that Theranos was one of the original unicorns, a private company with a value of more than $1 billion. We usually see the S.E.C. pursue charges against public companies and their executives, while private firms operate largely free from scrutiny – at least until they prepare for an I.P.O. Advertisement The antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, however, apply to any transaction in a security in which there is a misstatement of material fact. Thus, when Theranos raised millions of dollars by selling shares to hedge funds and venture capitalists, the false claims about the viability of its blood-testing labs ended up being a scheme to defraud. For Ms. Holmes, the settlement means that she will be cut off from raising money for any new venture for a long time. The complaint shows a systemic effort to deceive investors over a number of years, no doubt in a desperate hope that somehow the technology could be made to work. It is unlikely anyone in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street will trust her again. — Peter J. Henning Mr. Kudlow, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, said that Mr. Trump offered him the job as director of the National Economic Council and that he immediately accepted. Mr. Kudlow told The Journal that an announcement could come as early as Thursday. Reaction Mark Hamrick, Bankrate.com’s senior economic analyst: “It remains to be seen whether Kudlow can step into the role of a virtual moderating influence in this administration. Unlike others in this White House, he does have experience in government and the private sector. But unlike television where on-air conflict is sometimes mostly for show, the health of the national and global economy is at stake here.” Ten year’s ago almost to the day, JPMorgan Chase acquired Bear Stearns, a troubled investment bank, for what looked like a steal. But Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s C.E.O., has since said he wouldn’t do a deal like it again, citing the high legal costs that came later. But was buying Bear Stearns as bad a deal as Mr. Dimon suggests? While we don’t have all the numbers necessary for a full accounting, there is much in the public domain that can help answer this question. And this information suggests that, while the Bear Stearns acquisition probably wasn’t as profitable as expected in March 2008, JPMorgan may still have benefited from it — even after taking into account the legal expenses. What caused the legal costs and how big were they? The payouts were made mostly to settle allegations that Wall Street firms had stuffed loans into mortgage-backed bonds that did not meet agreed upon standards. How big were those costs? In his 2015 letter to shareholders, Mr. Dimon said that some 70 percent of JPMorgan’s nearly $19 billion in mortgage-related legal costs were related to Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, the thrift JPMorgan also bought during the crisis. For the sake of argument, let’s assume that 35 percent of that $19 billion stemmed from Bear Stearns’ mortgages. The cost to JPMorgan then would be around $6.7 billion. That’s a lot, but when JPMorgan did the deal, it agreed to terms that gave it a lot of financial protection against nasty surprises like this. JPMorgan paid $1.5 billion for Bear Stearns, far below the $11.8 billion of shareholders’ equity that Bear Stearns reported on its balance sheet at the end of 2007. This wide margin for error would have helped the bank absorb the $6 billion of merger-related costs that executives anticipated in March 2008. Advertisement True, JPMorgan almost certainly ended up marking down Bear Stearns’ riskier assets by more than expected in the months after the deal, when market conditions got even worse. But many of these assets could have recovered in the next few years as the financial system stabilized. After 2008, “principal transactions” at JPMorgan’s investment bank, the business line that included the performance of many of Bear Stearns’ assets, produced over $8 billion of annual revenue, far more than the $4.4 billion that JPMorgan on its own generated in 2007. Let’s also not forget that the Federal Reserve took a large slug of the risk in the deal. The Fed made an extraordinary loan to a special entity that bought some $30 billion of Bear Stearns’ assets. According to Kate Kelly’s book on Bear Stearns’ final days, JPMorgan was reluctant to buy Bear Stearns without assistance from the Fed. JPMorgan did provide a $1.2 billion loan to the Fed’s entity, in theory exposing it to some losses on the assets. But in the end, that loan generated a $665 million gain for JPMorgan in 2012. The Bear Stearns deal also came with some straightforward positives. JPMorgan, for instance, got Bear Stearns’ leading prime brokerage unit, a business that provided brokerage services to hedge funds. That and other Bear Stearns operations were expected to add at least $1 billion a year to JPMorgan earnings, the bank’s executives said at the time. And, of course, JPMorgan scooped up Bear Stearns’ trophy tower in Midtown Manhattan. At the time of the deal, the building, at 383 Madison Ave., had an estimated value of $1.2 billion. According to the estimates of developers in the New York real estate market, the building is now worth at least $1.8 billion. -- Peter Eavis with reporting from Charles V. Bagli. Jun Ying, the former chief information officer of Equifax’s core United States consumer reporting division, was charged on Wednesday with insider trading for selling nearly $1 million in company stock after he learned about a major data breach in 2017 but before it was publicly announced. Cybertrails The commission’s complaint against Mr. Ying describes a step he took to estimate what he might lose on his Equifax stock. He took to the internet to find out what had happened to the shares of Experian, a rival credit bureau, after it revealed that hackers had breached its system. At approximately 10:00 a.m. on Monday, August 28, 2017, Ying used a search engine to find information on the internet concerning the September 2015 cybersecurity breach of Experian, another one of the three major credit bureaus, and the impact that breach had on Experian’s stock price. The search terms used by Ying were: (1) “Experian breach”; (2) “Experian stock price 9/15/2015”; and (3) “Experian breach 2015.” — Peter Eavis When he killed Broadcom’s pursuit of Qualcomm, President Trump put his administration in uncharted territory. The White House has made no secret of its concerns about Beijing, and seems to have been motivated by the prospect of Qualcomm losing its lead in 5G. Some now worry that this could be another front in a potential global trade war. Here’s Jason Furman, a senior economic adviser in the Obama White House, talking to the NYT: “If every country in the world conducted policy like that, it would make cross-border investment difficult to the detriment of American and foreign companies,” Mr. Furman said. “Foreign direct investment is an important part of the strength of the U.S. economy.” Of note: Qualcomm spent far more than Broadcom on lobbying. Broadcom officially withdrew its bid this morning. Advertisement What’s next for Qualcomm: The chip maker’s Hail Mary — petitioning the government for a national-security review of Broadcom’s bid — paid off handsomely. But now it has to show investors that it can fix its business. Peter Eavis’s take: National champions have to deliver. Will Qualcomm become less efficient under the government’s protection? If so, U.S. tax payers may feel taken advantage of. Elsewhere in semiconductors: The industry largely ignored a short seller’s report on purported security flaws in AMD chips. (Axios) President Trump announced his metals tariffs to protect American makers of aluminum and steel. But that could put Boeing in the firing line — America’s top exporter, which employs nearly as many people as the U.S. steel and aluminum industries combined. More from Natalie Kitroeff of the NYT: “I’m really worried about what it’s going to do to us,” said James Springer, a mechanic who installs stow bins and class dividers on 787 Dreamliners at Boeing’s plant in North Charleston, S.C. “What will the E.U. and China do, especially China? They are one of our biggest customers now.” And Mr. Trump’s attacks on Chinese metal production are in some ways a relic of past trade battles, as Beijing moves away from basic commodities. Elsewhere in trade: Marco Rubio argues in an NYT Op-Ed that the U.S. should take measures more targeted than the tariffs to punish China for unfair trade practices.

 WASHINGTON/BEIJING —  U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports and will target the technology and telecommunications sectors, two people who had discussed the issue with the Trump administration said on Tuesday. A third source who had direct knowledge of the administration's thinking said the tariffs, associated with a ""Section 301"" intellectual property investigation, under the 1974 U.S. Trade Act begun in August last year, could come ""in the very near future."" While the tariffs would be chiefly targeted at information technology, consumer electronics and telecoms, they could be much broader and the list could eventually run to 100 products, this person said. The White House declined to comment on the size or timing of any move. In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Sino-U.S. trade relations should not be a zero-sum game, and that the two countries should use ""constructive"" means to manage tension. Advertisement ""We have said many times that China resolutely opposes any kind of unilateral protectionist trade measures,"" Lu told reporters. Advertisement ""If the United States takes actions that harm China's interests, China will have to take measures to firmly protect our legitimate rights."" Trump is targeting Chinese high technology companies to punish China for its investment policies that effectively force U.S. companies to give up their technology secrets in exchange for being allowed to operate in the country, as well as for other IP practices Washington considers unfair. The Trump administration is also considering imposing investment restrictions on Chinese companies over and above the heightened national security restrictions, but details on these were not immediately known. A U.S. Treasury spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But lobbyists in Washington expressed concern that Trump's ambitious tariff plan would also include other labor-intensive consumer goods sectors such as apparel, footwear and toys. Higher tariffs on these products would ""hurt American families,"" said Hun Quach, a trade lobbyist for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. ""We're not talking about fancy cashmere sweaters, we're talking about cotton T-Shirts and jeans and shoes that kids wear for back-to-school,"" she added. ""Alarm bells are ringing."" China runs a $375 billion trade surplus with the United States and when President Xi Jinping's top economic adviser visited Washington recently, the administration pressed him to come up with a way of reducing that number. Advertisement Trump came to office on a promise to shield American workers from imports and his first action as president was to pull the United States out of the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. His administration is in the midst of negotiations to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and last week announced the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. While the tariffs on steel and aluminum, announced last week by Trump, are viewed as relatively insignificant in terms of imports and exports, moves to target China directly risk a direct and harsh response from Beijing. ""If this is serious, the Chinese will retaliate. The key question is, does the U.S. retaliate against that retaliation,"" said Derek Scissors, a China trade expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a pro-business think tank.  . That would spook stock markets, but Scissors said that the more serious the conflict became, the worse China's position would become, due to the importance of its U.S. trade surplus. ""Their incentive to negotiate is to head us off from a major trade conflict."" NOT BIG ENOUGH The news website Politico earlier reported that the U.S. Trade Representative's office had presented Trump with a package of $30 billion in tariffs last week, but Trump told aides that this was not high enough. One Washington business source who had discussed the issue with the White House said the figure had now grown to about $60 billion, with a potentially wider array of products under consideration. A second person, who is an industry lobbyist in Washington  familiar with the administration's thinking, said the process was being led by Peter Navarro, an avowed protectionist, and by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who also favors tariffs as a tool to rebalance trade. Speaking to reporters in the Capitol, U.S. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady stressed that Trump was serious about addressing the issue of intellectual property theft with China. Advertisement ""He's serious about calling their hand on this, and my understanding is they are looking at a broad array of options to do that,"" Brady said. U.S. business groups, while uneasy about triggering Chinese  retaliation, have increasingly pressed Washington to take action on Beijing's industrial policies, such as market access restrictions and the ""Made in China 2025"" plan, which aims to supplant foreign technologies with domestic ones. Shortly after Trump took office, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a U.S. technology think tank whose board includes representatives from top companies such as Apple, Amazon, Cisco, Google, and Intel, called for coordinated international pressure on Beijing. While complaints about China's abuse of intellectual property rights are not confined to the United States, Trump's global steel and aluminum tariffs announced last week under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 complicate U.S. efforts to recruit allies to put pressure on China. A senior European diplomat in Beijing said China would be relieved to see Europe and Washington at odds over the metals tariffs. ""China's biggest worry has always been joint push-back from its major Western trading partners,"" the diplomat said. A China-based business source with knowledge of discussion among senior European officials said there had been a ""clear effort"" by the U.S. government over the past six months to introduce a coordinated approach to Chinese industrial policy, but that Trump's metals tariffs had undermined European support. ""Senior Trump administration officials had directly approached European leaders at a senior level. There had been a willingness to do something together on China. That's impossible right now. You can't cooperate when you're getting whacked around,"" the person told Reuters.

 (Reuters) - Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google corporate brands dropped in an annual survey while Amazon.com Inc maintained the top spot for the third consecutive year, and electric carmaker Telsa Inc rocketed higher after sending a red Roadster into space. IPhone maker Apple dropped to 29th from its previous position of No. 5, and Google dropped from 8th to No. 28. Apple had ranked No. 2 as recently as 2016, according to the annual Harris Poll Reputation Quotient poll released on Tuesday. The poll, conducted since 1999, surveyed 25,800 U.S. adults from Dec. 11 to Jan. 12 on the reputations the ""most visible"" corporate brands. John Gerzema, CEO of the Harris Poll, told Reuters in an interview that the likely reason Apple and Google fell was that they have not introduced as many attention-grabbing products as they did in past years, such as when Google rolled out free offerings like its Google Docs word processor or Google Maps and Apple's then-CEO Steve Jobs introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad. Advertisement ""Google and Apple, at this moment, are sort of in valleys,"" Gerzema said. ""We're not quite to self-driving cars yet. We're not yet seeing all the things in artificial intelligence they're going to do."" Advertisement Meanwhile, Amazon.com held on to the No. 1 spot, which it has held for five years with the exception of 2015, when it slipped to No. 2. Gerzema attributed Amazon's ranking to its expanding footprint in consumers' lives into areas like groceries via its Whole Foods acquisition. Elon Musk's Tesla climbed from No. 9 to No. 3 on the strength of sending Tesla Roadster into space aboard a SpaceX rocket - despite fleeting success delivering cars on time on earth, Gerzema said.  . ""He's a modern-day carnival barker - it's incredible,"" Gerzema said of Musk. ""This 'The Right Stuff' attitude is able to capture the public's imagination when every news headline is incredibly negative. They're filling a void of optimism."" For its part, Facebook Inc's reputation improved in the 2018 study, despite being the target of questions from U.S. lawmakers about the role of social media in Russia's efforts to influence the U.S. presidential election in 2016. Facebook ranked 51st, its best showing since 2014 when it ranked 38th, the highest the firm ever ranked in the poll. This year, film production company The Weinstein Co made its debut at 99th out of 100 on the list after more than 70 women accused co-founder Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, including rape. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

 BRUSSELS —  German antitrust regulators plan to open its third investigation into the digital market soon, its chief said on Tuesday, sending a warning to tech companies not to abuse their dominance or misuse their collection of personal data. The comments underline growing regulatory concerns across Europe about the collection of personal data by tech companies. Last month, the Federal Cartel Office kicked off a sector inquiry into online advertising after advertisers and publishers voiced worries about Google and Facebook's strong market position. The move came two months after it launched a sector inquiry to find out how smart TV makers handled user data and the terms of their contracts. Smart TVs, which allow viewers to receive and transmit their user data, have become increasingly popular. Advertisement ""There will be a third one (sector inquiry) in a short period of time which we are hoping to get out,"" antitrust chief Andreas Mundt told a conference organized by the Studienvereinigung Kartellrecht association.  . Asked by reporters about the investigation's focus, he said: ""If there are deficits (gaps in enforcement), it will be digital markets."" Granted new powers in June, the German watchdog can launch wide-ranging investigations if it has reasonable suspicion that consumer law provisions have been violated but it cannot sanction infringers or open individual cases.

 LONDON —  Britain said it was considering taxing the revenues of internet companies like Facebook and Google until international tax rules are changed to cope with digital firms that can shift sales and profits between jurisdictions. Finance minister Philip Hammond said on Tuesday he had published a paper setting out proposals for taxing global digital firms before a meeting with his G20 counterparts later this week. Big internet companies have previously paid little tax in Europe, typically by channelling sales via countries such as Ireland and Luxembourg, which have light-touch tax regimes. The European Union has proposed taxing tech giants between 1 and 5 percent of revenue based on where users are located, according to a draft Commision document seen by Reuters last month. Advertisement The tax should apply to companies selling user-targeted online ads or providing advertisement space, with revenues above 750 million euros ($922 million) worldwide and with EU digital revenues of at least 10 million euros, according to the document. Advertisement Both Google and Facebook have changed the way they account for their activity in Britain, resulting in a rise in corporate tax paid. But Facebook UK's tax charge for 2016, for example, was 5.1 million pounds ($7.09 million), only a modest increase on the 4.2 million pounds level in 2015. Its revenue in Britain in 2016 was 842 million pounds. ""In the autumn we published a paper on taxing large digital businesses in the global economy and today we follow up with a publication that explores potential solutions,"" Hammond said when he delivered an update on the government's finances. Late last year the government also raised the possibility of imposing new taxes on tech giants unless they do more to combat online extremism by taking down material aimed at radicalising people or helping them to prepare attacks. Britain suffered a series of Islamist attacks last year that killed a total of 36 people, excluding the attackers. The government said on Tuesday it favoured reforming the international corporate tax framework, but acknowledged that achieving consensus and creating detailed proposals would be difficult.  . ""In the absence of such reform, there is a need to consider interim measures such as revenue-based taxes,"" it said. Any changes would have to be targeted to protect start-ups and growth companies, it said, but it was clear that there was a challenge that needs to be solved. ""The current misalignment between where digital businesses are taxed and where they create value threatens to undermine the fairness, sustainability and public acceptability of the corporate tax system,"" it said, adding that it intended working closely with the EU and international partners on the issue. Advertisement TechUK, a group representing more than 950 tech firms, said corporate tax was highly complex, and the government needed to consider the risk of unintended consequences that could result from moving to a revenue-based tax approach. ""However, it remains the case that international cooperation and coordination are key,"" it said. ""Unilateral action in this area continues to risk cutting across international efforts at the OECD."" Britain's Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) said a revenue-based option would be ""extremely unwelcome"". ""We should work with the OECD and work up a properly agreed global solution,"" said ACCA's head of taxation Chas Roy-Chowdhury. ""A fully engineered solution rather than an half-baked idea should be the way forward."" Britain also said on Tuesday it would consult on a new mechanism for collecting value-added-tax (VAT) for online sales.

Among the companies expected to attend the March 20 meeting: Amazon, Snap, Facebook, Google and Twitter. The meeting was confirmed by Amazon and representatives of two companies speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the plans publicly. Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Trump, said in a statement that Mrs. Trump ""has simply asked for a meeting to discuss one of the many things that impacts children — as she has done many times in the past, on several different topics."" The meeting, first reported by The Washington Post, would mark Mrs. Trump's first public event on a subject she has previously expressed interest in. During the first year of her husband's administration, she played a low-key role. Advertisement Her interest in children has been clear, with visits to schools and hospitals.

 (Reuters) - U.S. media company Meredith Corp has hired advisers to explore a sale of its Time, Fortune, Money and Sports Illustrated magazines following its $1.84 billion acquisition of Time Inc in January, people familiar with the matter said. The move illustrates how Meredith sees some of Time Inc's titles that attract primarily male readership as not playing to its core strength in women's magazines, which include Better Homes & Gardens, Family Circle and Martha Stewart Living. The Des Moines, Iowa-based company has tapped investment banks Citigroup Inc and Houlihan Lokey Inc to find potential buyers for the magazines, the sources said this week. There is no certainty that a divestiture will occur, the sources added. While it's possible that media, telecommunications or technology companies could express an interest in the magazines, a sale to wealthy individuals, such as philanthropists or billionaires, is viewed by Meredith as more likely, according to one of the sources. Advertisement The sources asked not to be identified because details of the sale process are confidential. Citigroup declined to comment, while Houlihan Lokey did not immediately return a request for comment. Advertisement ""We are in fact exploring a number of additional changes to the (magazine) portfolio, including divestitures of brands and businesses that might perform better under a different owner,"" Meredith CEO Steven Lacy told investors at a Deutsche Bank conference earlier this month. Time Inc referred calls to Meredith, which declined to comment beyond reiterating that the company is reviewing its portfolio.  . It was not clear how much the magazines could be worth. Fortune and Money generated more than $20 million in 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBIDTA), while Time generated more than $30 million in 12-month EBITDA, according to one of the people. The potential divestitures underscore how Time Inc's primary attraction for Meredith was building scale in digital advertising. With its roots in traditional publishing, Meredith has been in a fierce competitive online race against internet giants such as Alphabet Inc’s Google and Facebook Inc for consumer eyeballs and advertising dollars. The deal with Time Inc expanded Meredith's reach with internet-savvy millennials, creating a digital media business with 170 million monthly unique visitors in the United States and more than 10 billion annual video views. Meredith's acquisition of Time Inc was aided by a $650 million investment from the private equity arm of Charles and David  Koch, the billionaire brothers known for championing conservative political causes.

IHeartMedia has struggled with debt that was taken on to finance a $17.9 billion leveraged buyout, or LBO, in 2008 of what was then Clear Channel Communications Inc. That deal led by Bain Capital LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP closed just as a financial crisis began to undermine the U.S. economy. In the years that followed, the operator of 849 radio stations has faced intensifying competition for advertisers and listeners from internet platforms such as music streaming services. Advertisement ""The LBO put this massive debt on the balance sheet that the company was supposed to grow into,"" a lawyer for iHeartMedia told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Marvin Isgur at a hearing in Houston on Thursday. ""We’re here to right-size the balance sheet."" Advertisement The company traces its roots to the 1972 purchase of KEEZ-FM in San Antonio, Texas, where it is currently headquartered. It said it would fund the business and bankruptcy process from cash on hand and cash generated from operations. It said in a statement it was seeking to maintain business as usual during the bankruptcy, and to ""uphold its commitments"" to its staff. It employs 12,400 people, according to court records. The filing comes less than four months after Cumulus Media Inc, which operates 445 U.S. radio stations, filed for Chapter 11. DEBT-CUTTING DEAL IHeartMedia had $3.58 billion in revenue in 2017 and reaches 271 million radio listeners, which the company says gives it a wider reach than Alphabet Inc's Google. The company also sells advertising on digital platforms, at live concerts and on syndicated programs featuring personalities such as Rush Limbaugh and ""American Idol"" host Ryan Seacrest. However, the company spent $1.4 billion on interest payments last year and has more than $8 billion in debt maturing by the end of 2019.  . The company's lawyers told the court iHeartMedia was on the cusp of having enough support from creditors to impose its plan on hold-outs. Under the company's debt-cutting deal, holders of secured loans and secured notes, who are owed nearly $13 billion, agreed to accept about $5.6 billion in new debt and 94 percent of the equity in a reorganized iHeartMedia, according to court documents. These creditors also will receive iHeartMedia's 89.5 percent stake in Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc, the world's largest billboard company, which did not file for bankruptcy. Advertisement IHeartMedia also proposed that junior debt holders, who are owed more than $2 billion, will receive their pro rata share of 5 percent of the equity in the reorganized company and $200 million in new secured notes. Existing shareholders would receive 1 percent of the stock in the reorganized company, according to court documents. IHeartMedia faces a legal challenge from a group, led by investment fund Angelo, Gordon & Co, which holds $190 million of junior debt, according to the company. Their lawyer said at Thursday's hearing they plan to file a lawsuit to challenge the contention that they are low-priority unsecured creditors, and Isgur said he wanted a hearing on that dispute before April. IHeartMedia has drawn interest from John Malone's Liberty Media Corp, which proposed on Feb. 26 a deal to buy a 40 percent stake in a restructured iHeartMedia for $1.16 billion. The deal would unite iHeartMedia with Liberty's Sirius XM Holdings Inc satellite radio service.

 WASHINGTON —  Lawmakers pushing legislation aimed at preventing China from acquiring sensitive U.S. technology have proposed relaxing elements of the measure after lobbying by high-tech firms but will tighten another portion, according to a draft revision seen by Reuters. The bill in the Senate and a companion measure in the U.S. House of Representatives would broaden the reach of the inter-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) in hopes of halting Chinese efforts to acquire sophisticated U.S. technology. The bipartisan legislation has the support of President Donald Trump's administration. Tech companies criticized the original legislation amid concerns it could limit or slow their exports, which in 2016 totaled $153 billion, according to World Bank data. Among the companies lobbying for the changes were Google parent Alphabet Inc, Facebook Inc, IBM Corp, Intel Corp, Qualcomm Inc and a long list of other hardware and software companies. Advertisement CFIUS has gone from virtually unknown several years ago to front-page news this month as one of its probes resulted in Trump forbidding chipmaker Broadcom, which is in the process of moving back to the United States, from buying rival Qualcomm. Advertisement A technology industry group said the original bill broadened CFIUS' reach so much that companies that sell sensitive technology could potentially be forced to go before the panel to have any sale reviewed, even the most uncontroversial. They also argued that some technology transfers were already reviewed by other U.S. agencies. Josh Kallmer, senior vice president for global policy for the Information Technology Industry Council, said the changes were positive. ""We see this as a huge step in the right direction both atmospherically and substantively,"" he said. One revision would exempt products covered by other export rules, meaning a technology already covered by the Arms Export Control Act, to cite one example, would also fall under CFIUS jurisdiction. The initial draft of the bill could have expanded CFIUS oversight to anything sold by a ""critical technology company,"" a term meaning technology with military importance and a big expansion of CFIUS' mandate.  . The revision trims that back to giving CFIUS oversight over joint ventures that might involve ""critical technology"" transfer, preventing CFIUS from being flooded with applications related to older technology. The revised version of the bill also makes it easier for CFIUS to review certain, smaller investments. An earlier version had said that investors had to buy 25 percent of a company or have a ""voting interest"" to come under CFIUS' jurisdiction. The new version says only that CFIUS would look at foreign investors buying a ""substantial interest"" in a firm. ""The change from 'voting interest' to any 'interest' is a big change. It could subject government-backed investment funds, like pension plans, to mandatory CFIUS filings even when their investment gives them no voting authority,"" said Peter Alfano, a CFIUS expert with the law firm Squire Patton Boggs LLP. ""CFIUS has long been concerned about dominant minority shareholdings."" MORE DEALS REJECTED The bills are aimed at reining in China's acquisition of U.S. high tech knowledge even as China has sought to focus on production of higher-value goods. China's industrial output in January and February showed the output of computers, telecommunications equipment and other electronics rose sharply over the previous year. Output of industrial robots rose around 25 percent. Advertisement While CFIUS' review of Broadcom got a huge attention, the panel has quietly rejected an increasing number of proposed acquisitions, many of them Chinese companies seeking to buy U.S. semiconductor firms or companies with large amounts of data about Americans. ""They (the changes) don’t detract significantly from the thrust of the bill, but they do ease the minds of business lawyers,"" added Stewart Baker, a CFIUS expert with the law firm Steptoe & Johnson PLLC. The Senate version of the bill has 11 co-sponsors while the House version has more than 35 co-sponsors.

 LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO —  Streaming music leader Spotify used its cultural cool factor to appeal to mom-and-pop investors in an unconventional presentation ahead of its April 3 stock market listing. Led by 35-year-old Chief Executive Daniel Ek, wearing jeans, white t-shirt and a dark blazer, executives said Spotify would prioritize growth over profits to fend off big rivals Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc, while also seeing a clear path to making money. Ek's team made a direct case to individual investors in a public webcast instead of a traditional closed-door road show typically used to woo institutional investors in initial public offerings (IPOs). The Stockholm-based company's stock will hit the public markets in a direct listing without traditional underwriters. It must convince investors that its business is sound and that investors who buy shares in the public market debut will not be hurt by unexpected volatility. Advertisement ""You won't see us ringing any bells or throwing any parties,"" Ek said. ""Since Spotify isn't selling any stock in the listing, we're really entirely focused on the long-term performance of the business."" Advertisement The direct listing is critical to alleviating Spotify's losses, which are driven by financing costs, and will enable all late-stage investors to convert debt holdings into equity. Spotify's revenue grew 39 percent to 4.09 billion euros ($5.04 billion) in 2017 from 2.95 billion euros in 2016, it said in a securities filing. At the same time, net financing costs of 855 million euros pushed up operating losses to 378 million euros from 349 million euros. Chief Financial Officer Barry McCarthy, the former long-serving CFO of streaming video giant Netflix Inc, said Spotify's strategy was to prioritize growth before short-term profitability, and that greater scale would enable profit margins to swell. With 71 million subscribers at the end of 2017, Spotify is the leader in streaming music. It also has 92 million users of its free, advertising-supported service, which it says delivers a constant stream of converts to its paid offering. That will keep it ahead of Apple, the company believes. Tomas Otterbeck, an equities analyst with Swedish research firm Redeye, said he was impressed by McCarthy repeating the idea that ""We are playing a market share game"" and that Spotify could reach 100 million paying subscribers by early next year. The independent service is jockeying against efforts from Apple, which has 38 million paid listeners and eschews  advertising-supported services.  . Apple, Spotify, Google and other services charge around $9.99 a month for music subscriptions. Amazon Prime service subscribers can get the music service for $7.99 a month. Ek portrayed Spotify as an underdog not tied to a major technology company, describing a strategy to be a ubiquitous music service available across phones, computers, smart speakers and car entertainment systems. Advertisement Because the company will not issue any new shares, it did not specify a listing price. Based on private transactions, it is valued at roughly $19 billion, according to Reuters calculations. It has hired brokerage Morgan Stanley to match buy and sell orders to set its opening trading price and said it will provide financial guidance to investors on March 26. STAYING AHEAD McCarthy spelled out Spotify’s long-term operating targets for generating sustained free cash flow, with annual revenue growth between 25 and 35 percent and gross margin between 30 and35 percent - ambitious for a loss-making company. Helping listeners find new bands and songs is an ""infinitely larger"" opportunity in music than so-called discovery was for video, McCarthy said, comparing Netflix’s rapid rise from mail-order DVD distribution into a streaming media service to Spotify’s audio streaming business. Spotify could devour the $28 billion, advertising-driven radio market, he said. Advertising makes up only about 10 percent of Spotify's current revenue, and McCarthy said he would be ""thrilled"" if Spotify could pull in 20 percent of its revenue from ads, although he expressed some doubt about whether the company could hit that mark. “There is an enormous pay-off for whoever wins. Now it remains to be seen whether we will win, but that's the game we are playing,"" he said.

 Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Wells Fargo’s C.E.O. gets a pay raise. • Peter Thiel discusses trade. • Theranos’s fall is nearly complete. • Why John Skipper left ESPN abruptly. • Alibaba is exploring a China listing. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. There will be no roadshow. No ringing of the bell. No party or C.E.O interview from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Spotify, the streaming music service, is eschewing the traditional initial public offering for a direct listing and is taking its pitch directly to retail investors, streaming its presentation on its website Thursday. Advertisement Here are a few takeaways: Why a direct listing? The post-I.P.O. lockup period, during which employees can’t sell shares. “We have allowed shareholders and employees to buy and sell stock for years,” said Daniel Ek, Spotify’s C.E.O.and founder, said. “That shouldn’t stop just because our stock is more widely owned.” Advertisement The company is also well capitalized with positive free cash flow and no debt. Room to Grow? The number of smartphone users to continues to grow but Spotify said it only reaches a small portion within the countries it operates. The company is also working with auto makers to integrate its platform with cars, where more than 30 percent of music listening happens. Apple and Amazon are a big risk to Spotify’s business? Tech giants like Apple, Amazon and Google each have their own streaming music services. Spotify’s service is delivered over Apple’s iPhone and Amazon’s Echo. Those companies could prioritize their own services on their devices. What is the next date to watch? March 26. That’s the date when Spotify will release first-quarter results and 2018 guidance. What is “algotorial?” It’s the term that Spotify’s head of research and development used to describe the mix of algorithms and humans that Spotify uses to curate its music. Regulators recently penalized Wells Fargo for years of misconduct, but on Wednesday, the bank gave its C.E.O. a hearty pay rise. How did that happen? The numbers: Timothy J. Sloan’s compensation for 2017 totaled $17.6 million, a 35 percent increase from the $13 million he earned in 2016. His stock award for 2017 was $15 million, a big jump from $10.5 million in 2016. Is the increase justified, given the bank’s issues? Wells Fargo would no doubt point to the fact that Mr. Sloan decided to forgo a cash bonus in 2017. John G. Stumpf, a former C.E.O., got a $4 million cash bonus in 2015, for instance. Also, Mr. Sloan’s stock award was set in February last year and reflects his promotion in 2016 to C.E.O. And if Wells Fargo slips up badly over the next three years, Mr. Sloan may not get the entire $15 million stock award. Advertisement How does Mr. Sloan’s pay stack up against others? He is making less than the C.E.O. of Bank of America, Brian T. Moynihan, who made $21.8 million last year. But Mr. Sloan is making quite a bit more than the chief executives of large regional banks. US Bank’s chief executive, Andrew Cecere, had 2017 compensation of $12 million. But Mr. Sloan looks overpaid on a new metric that public companies must provide. This yardstick compares a C.E.O.’s pay with that of the median employee’s pay. Mr. Sloan’s 2017 pay was 291 times that of Wells Fargo’s median earner. That is above the 250 times for Mr. Moynihan. And Mr. Sloan’s ratio is far in excess of Mr. Cecere’s 205 times. — Peter Eavis One of President Trump’s most prominent supporters in the business world on Thursday said the United States would have the upper hand against China in a trade skirmish. Peter Thiel, a technology entrepreneur with libertarian leanings, told the Economic Club of New York that the United States doesn’t export enough to China to make it vulnerable to Chinese retaliation. If Mr. Trump imposed trade restrictions on Chinese goods, as he may in the coming weeks, China could do the same to United States exports. Mr. Thiel seemed unfazed by that. “It’s quite unclear where China can reciprocate because we are exporting so little,” he said. Mr. Thiel’s views echo those of Mr. Trump. 
            When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore-we win big. It’s easy!         The American exports to China are not small. They totaled $184 billion in the 12 months through the end of September 2017. That makes China the United States’ fourth-largest export market after the European Union, Canada and Mexico. The United States, however, imports far more from China than it exports, which means the deficit with China is far larger than it is with Mexico and the European Union. - Peter Eavis The blood-testing start-up was once one of Silicon Valley’s most lauded unicorns. But, the S.E.C. says, it deceived investors about what its tech could do and how much business it did. And its founder Elizabeth Holmes — a Stanford dropout who was compared favorably to Steve Jobs — has been stripped of her C.E.O. title and her shares. More from John Carreyrou of the WSJ, who first reported on issues at Theranos: Many Theranos investors have lost the entire value of their investment. The losses for [Rupert] Murdoch, once the company’s largest investor, total more than $100 million, people familiar with the matter said. The S.E.C. said in its civil lawsuit Wednesday that Theranos was “on the verge of bankruptcy” in late 2017. The company has been kept afloat by a loan from a private-equity firm that is secured by Theranos’s patents. Matt Levine of Bloomberg View reminds us about the company’s other victims: patients. Peter Henning’s take: The S.E.C.’s case shows that it considers privately held companies as capable of defrauding investors as publicly traded ones. Elsewhere in S.E.C. violations: The agency charged a former Equifax executive with insider trading, saying he sold shares after learning of the company’s data breach before it was publicly reported. It’s official: The CNBC commentator will become President Trump’s chief economic adviser, replacing Gary Cohn. But what will Mr. Kudlow — who on TV is an ardent supporter of free trade — push for? Advertisement He supports a strong dollar and tariffs that make exceptions for allies like Canada and Mexico. And he’s in favor of permanently extending the Republican tax cuts for individuals. As for his stance on China, here’s what he told CNBC: “A thought that I have is the United States could lead a coalition of large trading partners and allies against China, or to let China know that they’re breaking the rules left and right.” One thing to watch for: whether his past admission of substance abuse would affect his work. “We’ll see how that plays out,” Mr. Kudlow said. Critics’ corner: Mark Hamrick, Bankrate.com’s senior economic analyst, writes, “It remains to be seen whether Kudlow can step into the role of a virtual moderating influence in this administration.” And Noah Smith of Bloomberg View asserts, “It also seems like there are just so few credible economic thinkers willing to stand up and sign their name to the Trump economic agenda.” Elsewhere in economic policy: U.S. companies have few ways around the proposed metals tariffs. And U.S. allies might emphasize their toughness against China to win tariff exemptions. Mr. Kudlow has prognosticated on many economic and political issues, often in a way that mirrors his future boss. His predictions, which will soon carry new weight as the president’s top economic adviser, have not always been on the mark. Our colleagues Deborah Solomon and Kitty Bennett take a look at some of Mr. Kudlow’s not-so-on-the-money calls. Here are a few of the ones they found: In 2005 “All the bond bears have been dead wrong in predicting sky-high mortgage rates. So have all the bubbleheads who expect housing-price crashes in Las Vegas or Naples, Fla., to bring down the consumer, the rest of the economy and the entire stock market.” (Well, we all know what happened. By 2008, home prices were in a free-fall, threatening to plunge the financial system and the economy into the abyss.) In 1993 “There’s no question that President Clinton’s across-the-board tax increases on labor, capital and energy will throw a wet blanket over the recovery and depress the economy’s long-run potential to grow.” (The period between 1990 and 1999 was the longest bull market in history. The S&P 500 more than tripled during that time.) Advertisement In 2015 “Given the recent rise of presidential candidate Donald Trump, we should all be thankful that stocks haven’t plunged. Trump’s agenda of trade protectionism, dollar devaluation, and immigrant deportation is completely anti-growth. It’s like Fortress America in an economy that is completely globalized and where the U.S. must compete in the worldwide race for capital and labor. Trump’s policies don’t fit.” (President Trump was elected and the stock market has only climbed. ) • How Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone became a close adviser to President Trump on China — but lost the tariff battle.

I foreclosed that possibility by disclosing the details to my family, and then when I discussed it with Bob, he and I agreed that I had placed the company in an untenable position and as a result, I should resign.” The WSJ reports that the Chinese online shopping giant is working on a plan to list shares in its home market. Such a listing would come nearly four years after Alibaba went public on the New York Stock Exchange, in what is the still the world’s largest initial public offering. Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . Details • A secondary listing could happen as soon as this summer, The WSJ reports. • China’s security regulators would have to change rules that bar foreign companies from listing in the country. Alibaba is incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Advertisement • China also doesn’t allow companies with dual-class share structure to list in the country. Context Alibaba’s plans come as “Chinese authorities are trying to lure some of the country’s technology stalwarts back to its capital markets,” The WSJ reports. Alibaba’s stock has jumped nearly 200 percent since it went public in 2014, gains that most Chinese investors have missed out on. Shares of Alibaba are up 3.1 percent Thursday. Christian Bittar, a former senior trader at Deutsche Bank, pleaded guilty earlier this month to conspiracy to defraud in the manipulation of a global benchmark interest rate known as Euribor, the Serious Fraud Office said on Thursday. A court in Britain lifted an order on Thursday that prevented the media from reporting his plea. “It would not be right to make comment prior to the trial of the remaining defendants and prior to Mr. Bittar’s sentencing,” David Savell, a lawyer for Mr. Bittar, said. Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $2.5 billion in penalties in 2015 related to the benchmark interest rate rigging scandal. A trial of five other traders is set for next month. - Chad Bray The Senate, in a rare show of bipartisanship, voted 67-31 to relax regulations on small to medium-sized banks. What the bill includes: • Raising the threshold for “systemically important” banks to $250 billion in assets, up from $50 billion • Exempting firms with less than $10 billion in assets from the Volcker rule But the House may want a more aggressive version that would curtail the power of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That could endanger the proposed overhaul, with the analyst Brian Gardner telling the NYT, “If the House overreaches in its effort to amend the Crapo bill, it could slow down the bill’s progress.” Elsewhere in banking: Why another Bear Stearns-like collapse isn’t likely, but another crisis is. The 70-year-old company’s plans to close or sell its stores in the U.S. and Britain show how hard life has become for bricks-and-mortar retailers. The collapse could put over 30,000 U.S. jobs at risk. Advertisement More on what happened from Michael Corkery of the NYT: Weighed down by the debt that its owners heaped on the company when they bought it, Toys “R” Us has not adequately invested in its fading stores and e-commerce operations. Unable to compete with other retailers, it has lost market share to better capitalized toy sellers. Speaking of Amazon: The company has become shorthand for “disruption” across industries. The current generation of Silicon Valley giants started out with an ethos of revolution first, fixes afterward. (Remember Facebook’s “move fast and break things” motto?) But Facebook, Google and others are becoming more bureaucratic, according to our columnist Kevin Roose — and that’s a good thing.

 BRUSSELS —  A consumer group on Monday said experts appointed by the European Commission to advise on tackling fake news had ignored the business model that gave the likes of Google and Facebook a motive for disseminating it. The tech giants have come under fire in Europe for not doing enough to remove misleading or illegal content, including incitement to hatred, extremism and the online sale of counterfeit products. The EU executive will publish a non-binding policy paper on the subject in the spring. The group of 39 experts it appointed, including representatives from social media, news media and the public, called for a code of principles for online platforms and social networks. It said companies should provide transparency by explaining how algorithms selected news shown to the public, promote media literacy and develop tools to help consumers tackle the issue. Advertisement The experts also said authorities should let the companies regulate themselves. Both Google and Facebook have expressed support for better controls over illicit content, saying they favour a code of conduct they could adhere to rather than being required to police such content themselves.  . But Monique Goyens, Director General of BEUC - an umbrella group for 43 national consumer organisations from 31 European countries - said the experts' report had failed to address one of the core causes of fake news. Advertisement ""Platforms such as Google or Facebook massively benefit from users reading and sharing fake news articles which contain advertisements. But this expert group choose to ignore this business model. This is head-in-the-sand politics,"" she said in a statement. ""The burden for de-bunking fake news should not rest on people,"" she said, adding that the non-binding code of principles could turn out to be toothless.

 LONDON —  Thomson Reuters Corp is to track and analyze chatter about bitcoin on hundreds of news and social media websites to help investors looking for an edge in trading the world's biggest cryptocurrency, the company said on Monday. A new version of its MarketPsych Indices, which it runs in conjunction with MarketPsych Data LLC, a behavioral economics research firm, will scan over 400 websites, many specific to cryptocurrencies, to capture market-moving sentiment and themes, Thomson Reuters said in a statement. Digging through market chatter and analyzing online sentiment has long proven popular among traders of traditional asset classes. The boom in the prices of cryptocurrencies in recent years has spurred a huge online industry where individuals exchange trading ideas in forums and news websites report on the latest developments in the industry. Advertisement Many analysts have linked online activity, for example Google searches for ""bitcoin"", with the price of the best-known cryptocurrency.  . ""News and social media are driving the investment and risk management process more than ever with the continuing rise of passive and quant-driven trading,"" said Austin Burkett, Global Head of Quant and Feeds, Thomson Reuters. Bitcoin's price gained more than 1,300 percent last year as investors piled in, and since peaking at close to $20,000 in December has lost more than half its value. It was trading at around $9,600 on the Luxembourg-Bitstamp exchange on Monday. Advertisement (Reporting by Tommy Wilkes; Editing by Janet Lawrence) We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

 SEATTLE —  Microsoft Corp on Monday said 200,000 organizations are now using Teams, its year-old workplace collaboration software, up from 125,000 in September, a sign the company may be making some progress in its battle with Slack Technologies Inc. Microsoft also announced a slate of new features for Teams, including instant language translation. Slack's emergence as a popular platform for workplace messaging and document-sharing is a threat to Microsoft's long-standing dominance in office productivity software. Teams now comes bundled with Microsoft Office 365 as the company battles rival offerings from companies including privately-held Slack, Alphabet Inc's Google, Atlassian Corp PLC, Cisco Systems Inc and Facebook Inc. ""These group messaging tools go far beyond just chat and are becoming a central hub for integrating a variety of business applications into a single user interface,"" said Alan Lepofsky, analyst with Constellation Research. ""They are essentially the new inbox."" Advertisement Microsoft has raced to make Teams a viable competitor after realizing several years ago that Slack was making inroads with big customers. A former Microsoft Office executive told Reuters that learning of the widespread adoption of Slack at Walt Disney Co in early 2015 was an especially important wake-up call. Advertisement ""It's one thing when an app gains traction with startups in Silicon Valley, that happens all the time,"" said the former employee, who asked not to be named. ""But it's another when your biggest, longest-tenured customers start adopting it, and then you realize you have to respond."" San Francisco-based Slack said in September that it had 6 million daily users and more than 50,000 paying teams. It has not published new figures since then. Microsoft has not released comparable figures for Teams. Slack has a big lead when it comes to third-party applications, with more than 1,000 compared to 250 for Teams.  . Teams is still not as simple to use as Slack and lacks the depth of functionality, said Wayne Kurtzman, an analyst with the research firm IDC. ""As great as Microsoft Teams has done in the past year, it's still not as mature of a product,"" Kurtzman said. Microsoft says it is gaining ground, pointing to customers such as Navistar, the manufacturer of trucks and buses. Navistar moved about a thousand employees onto Teams last year, choosing it over Slack due to its long-time relationship with Microsoft, said Terry Kline, Navistar chief information officer. ""We looked at Slack, and we didn't see any significant advantage,"" Kline told Reuters in a phone interview. The move has reduced the company's use of email by 3 percent, he added. Other Teams customers include Macy's, General Motors, General Electric, ConocoPhillips and Nascar, according to Microsoft. ""It's surprised all of us how extremely well it's doing,"" Microsoft Teams General Manager Lori Wright told Reuters.

DEALBOOK
MARCH 12, 2018
 The company Kitty Hawk has been testing a new kind of fully electric, self-piloting flying taxi. It takes off like a helicopter and flies like a plane. Since October, a mysterious flying object has been seen moving through the skies over the South Island of New Zealand. It looks like a cross between a small plane and a drone, with a series of small rotor blades along each wing that allow it to take off like a helicopter and then fly like a plane. To those on the ground, it has always been unclear whether there was a pilot aboard. Well, it turns out that the airborne vehicle has been part of a series of “stealth” test flights by a company personally financed by Larry Page, the co-founder of Google and now the chief executive of Google’s parent, Alphabet. The company, known as Kitty Hawk and run by Sebastian Thrun, who helped start Google’s autonomous car unit as the director of Google X, has been testing a new kind of fully electric, self-piloting flying taxi. This is an altogether different project from the one you might have seen last year in a viral video of a single-pilot recreational aircraft that was being tested over water, and it’s much more ambitious. Imagine starting a network of autonomous air taxis, as Uber is planning to, but long before Uber actually does. That’s what Mr. Page is trying to do. Advertisement Until now, you wouldn’t know the air taxis in New Zealand had anything to do with Mr. Page: The planes operate there in what has been a covert project, under a company called Zephyr Airworks. Advertisement Now that project is about to go public: On Tuesday, Mr. Page’s company and the prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, will announce they have reached an agreement to test Kitty Hawk’s autonomous planes as part of an official certification process. The hope is that it will lead to a commercial network of flying taxis in New Zealand in as soon as three years. The move is a big step forward in the commercialization of this technology, which even the most optimistic prognosticators had recently bet would take another decade to achieve. The decision to embrace the commercial use of flying taxis offers New Zealand an opportunity to leapfrog many developed countries in this area, and perhaps give it a head start over Silicon Valley, where much of the most innovative work has been taking place. In an email, Ms. Ardern said the decision to work with Kitty Hawk was “about sending the message to the world that our doors are open for people with great ideas who want to turn them into reality.” She added, “We’ve got an ambitious target in New Zealand of being net carbon zero by 2050,” and given that the Kitty Hawk vehicle is fully electric, “exciting projects like this are part of how we make that happen.” Back here in the United States, the move stands as a major challenge for our regulators, in particular the Federal Aviation Administration. While the F.A.A. allows test flights of autonomous vehicles, there is no path to certify and commercialize them despite a constant stream of headlines about efforts from Uber, Airbus and others. Thus far, the agency, which oversees much busier skies than New Zealand and has long been underfunded, has been slow to adopt rules for new technologies. Other countries, mostly in the Middle East and Africa, have been more aggressive about allowing unmanned flights and appear willing to be some of the first places where this technology will be used. But those countries have never been seen as models for aviation regulators in the rest of the developed world. New Zealand, on the other hand, has long been viewed as having a thoughtful and safety-conscious regulatory regime. That means that the rules it develops may become a template for other nations, including the United States. A number of rival companies have been laying the groundwork for air taxis. In November, Boeing acquired Aurora Flight Sciences. Airbus made an investment two weeks ago in Blade, an aviation start-up in New York. Dubai formed a partnership with a Chinese company, EHang. And of course Uber has an entire division called Uber Elevate. Advertisement For those who follow the progress in this field — technologists, flight enthusiasts and billionaires seeking to transform the skies — it was thought that Mr. Page had been testing flights of a new self-piloting plane only in Northern California; several reports and images revealed the existence of newfangled aircraft last year from a company based there, called Zee Aero, that was associated with Mr. Page. The mystery of what has been going on in New Zealand has quietly created a stir among those in the know. Kitty Hawk set up Zephyr in 2016 and has been in discussions, under a nondisclosure agreement, with regulators there for the past 18 months. There has been some speculation about the origin of Zephyr because it lists its chief executive as Fred Reid, who had also been listed as president of Zee Aero.  . Mr. Page’s ambitions to create taxis in the sky has a sense of gravity, excuse the pun, not just because of his deep pockets and the technological prowess of his team but also because of Mr. Reid, who is a former chief executive of Virgin America. Before that he was president of Delta Air Lines and president of Lufthansa Airlines, where he was co-architect of the Star Alliance. In an interview, Mr. Reid said the opportunity to use New Zealand as the first place to commercialize the autonomous taxi service was a step-change in the advancement of the sector. Kitty Hawk is already working on an app that would allow customers to hail one of its air taxis. The aircraft, known as Cora, has a wingspan of 36 feet with a dozen rotors all powered by batteries. It can fly about 62 miles and carry two passengers. (Its code name had been Zee.Aero — hence all the speculation and confusion.) The plan, at least for now, isn’t for Kitty Hawk to sell the vehicles; it wants to own and operate a network of them itself. But before everyone gets too excited — or nervous — about this “Jetsons”-like future, just know that virtually every prediction about how quickly air taxis would arrive has been wrong. Just last year, Dubai said EHang would begin operating an autonomous flying taxi service last July. It never happened. An earlier version of this article misstated the wingspan of the Cora aircraft being tested in New Zealand. It is 36 feet, not 12 feet. A version of this article appears in print on March 13, 2018, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Flying Taxis, Now Exiting Stealth Mode.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe

 (Reuters) - Dropbox Inc on Monday offered a price range for shares in its initial public offering that would value it at up to $7.1 billion, nearly a third below the valuation it commanded in 2014, a clear sign of how overheated the private tech market became a few years back. Cloud storage company Dropbox is the largest tech IPO after a protracted dry spell, and investors are carefully watching it for signs of how other highly valued tech companies will be received by the public markets. If Dropbox is a barometer for public market sentiment, it appears that investors will not endorse the valuations that many billion-dollar-plus startups now command. The spring calendar for technology offerings is relatively busy, including cyber security company Zscaler's planned debut later this week and music company Spotify's expected listing early next month. San Francisco-based Dropbox set a price range of $16 to $18 per share, which would raise up to $648 million in the highly anticipated public offering planned for Friday. The range serves as guidance, and the company will set a final price, based on investor feedback, on the eve of the IPO. Advertisement The pricing is about a 30 percent drop from the $10 billion valuation Dropbox earned in early 2014 after a financing round led by BlackRock Inc. The company, which started as a free service to share and store photos, music and other large files, has raised more than $600 million from private investors. Advertisement New investors ranging from mutual funds to hedge funds began piling into startups a few years ago in hopes of earning better returns than the public markets offered, driving a spike in investments beginning in 2014 that came with outsized valuations. Now, Dropbox's valuation cut suggests other companies that similarly raised a lot of money at high valuations but remain unprofitable, such as Uber Technologies Inc, may face a valuation decrease when they, too, go public. ""Dropbox is still loss-making and its revenue is not enough to justify a market value of $10 billion,"" said Phil Davis, chief executive of Phil's Stock World, an investment advisory service. ""The price had to come down to lure in the investors."" While venture financing remains high, startup valuations have mostly stabilized in the United States. ""GROSSLY OVERVALUED UNICORNS"" Dropbox competes with much larger companies such as Alphabet Inc's Google, Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com Inc as well as main rival Box Inc. It long struggled to monetize a product that many of its larger rivals offer for free and moved to offer more products for businesses, such as file synch and group collaboration tools.  . The efforts appear to have paid off. Revenues grew by 31 percent to $1.1 billion in 2017 over the prior year, and losses narrowed by almost half to $112 million. Last year, it had positive free cash flow of $305 million, more than double the previous year. By comparison, revenue at Box, which started two years before Dropbox, is expected to increase 25 percent to about $506 million this fiscal year from a year earlier. Box, which also is not profitable, went public in 2015. Dropbox's $7.07 billion valuation, based on the high end of its IPO price range, is two-and-a-half times that of Box's $2.85 billion market capitalization. Advertisement Despite its progress and four years of growth, Dropbox's financial performance still does not justify its 2014 valuation, some investors say. Eric Schiffer, chairman and chief executive of the Patriarch Organization, a private equity firm, said Wall Street had rational figures for ""grossly overvalued unicorns,"" using the term for startup companies valued at $1 billion or more. ""The IPO is a slap in the face to investors of the 2014 round"" of Dropbox, he added.    Dropbox, co-founded in 2007 by Andrew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, has 500 million users across 180 countries. But most use the free service - about 11 million are paying customers. Upon completion of the public offering, Dropbox will sell $100 million worth of common stock at the IPO price to the venture capital arm of Salesforce.com Inc in a separate private placement, the company said. Houston is the largest shareholder and will retain 24 percent of Dropbox after selling 2.3 million shares in the offering. Sequoia Capital is the largest shareholder among outside investors, with about a 25 percent stake.

T1,12-Mar-18,"Advertisement Supported by By Sapna Maheshwari In a sunny office in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, Mike Schmidt spends his time ferreting out fake Instagram accounts. Some are obvious, like the one that had never posted a photo and lacked a profile picture yet followed about 7,500 accounts — the maximum allowed by the social media site. Others are trickier. Mr. Schmidt had to scroll down a little on an account with the name @ailebnoblk before the same stock image of a car showed up three times in a row, a clue that there was no real person behind the profile. “The amount of bot activity that’s happening on these platforms is pretty insane,” Mr. Schmidt said. “Just the amount of new accounts and times these folks are liking and commenting with spam and positive comments and happy-face emojis.” Dovetale, a four-person software company Mr. Schmidt co-founded in 2016, has devised a range of tactics to identify large numbers of fake accounts that follow popular Instagram personalities. It then packages that information for marketers, who are increasingly skeptical of the audience numbers that often determine how much money social media stars can command from advertisers. Marketers are flocking to businesses like Dovetale, prompted by revelations like those in a recent investigation by The New York Times that detailed the booming industry of people buying fake followers and fraudulent engagement on Twitter and other social media sites. Some of these fake accounts, in an attempt to seem legitimate, use personal information from real people without their knowledge. That has provoked concern among brands and their agencies, which often rely on metrics like the number of followers an account has when hiring people on YouTube and Instagram to promote their products. These social media stars can often fetch thousands of dollars for one post promoting a product. “We knew this kind of day of reckoning would come,” said Erick Schwab, the co-founder of Sylo, which vets influencers for fraud and aims to assign a numerical score to their content akin to a Nielsen rating. “We’ve gotten tons of brands, agencies, vendors emailing us, who we’ve been having conversations with for a while, but now they’re sort of like, this is being demanded.” Krishna Subramanian, a founder of Captiv8, which connects brands with influencers, has seen a surge in requests for fraud detection from agencies. “Everyone is definitely scrambling because they don’t want to be held responsible,” he said. The interest in such firms reflects how easy it is to fake popularity on platforms like Instagram, where bots seem to run unchecked even on accounts where people have not paid for them. While many advertisers have become aware of this, and tried to place more emphasis on content quality or favorable comments, follower numbers still tend to loom large. “Even though brands are looking for engagement more, the actual pay and compensation that influencers are getting is still based on the follower number,” said Alivia Latimer, a photographer with about 102,000 Instagram followers. Ms. Latimer, who has worked with brands including Lush Cosmetics and Hollister, said that she charged about $1,200 for a branded post. She added that she knew people with two million followers who charge $40,000 per post. That means new kinds of detective work are needed for brands that still want the endorsements of the young and hip online. Dovetale said it uses more than 50 metrics to analyze the Instagram followers of popular accounts, including the language in the bios, the rate at which they hit “like” and “follow,” and their country of origin. (An influencer with a high number of followers from Turkey, Brazil and China, for instance, can raise red flags for Dovetale, which has frequently seen fake followers come from those countries.) The clues can be complex. Dovetale flagged one account that claimed to be someone named Meg Cragle because it was part of a group of profiles that had made one or two unrelated posts and contained similarly worded bios of exactly 99 characters that ended with ellipses. The discovery was reinforced by a Google search for phrases in the account’s bio like “award-winning bacon fanatic,” which matched the terms in a now-deleted Twitter bio generator online. Dovetale acknowledged that its methods were not foolproof, but they are valuable enough in a murky landscape that the agency 360i said it was now unlikely to hire influencers for campaigns if Dovetale’s database said more than 2 to 3 percent of their followers were bots. Dovetale said that, on average, 16.4 percent of the followers on Instagram’s top 20 accounts were fraudulent. Sylo, which requires influencers to share access to their public and private post statistics, said it had rejected 77 percent of influencers who have tried to register on its platform after their accounts showed issues like abnormal spikes in engagement on posts or a large number of generic, emoji-laden comments that bots are known for. “In the absence of direct pressure on the platforms, it’s a way for advertisers to take more control of their own spend and not be at the mercy of the platforms themselves,” said Jeff Semones, head of social media at MediaCom, which has recommended Sylo to clients. While he said Instagram had removed many accounts that were flagrantly violating its terms and conditions, “a lot of one-off activity goes unchecked.” A spokeswoman for Instagram said that the platform’s “internal estimates show that spam accounts make up a small fraction” of Instagram’s 800 million monthly users. Some believe that the new awareness around bots highlights the misguided expectations that marketers have for how many people they can reach through influencers. Changes to algorithms on Facebook and Instagram have significantly reduced the number of people who will see a person’s posts without paid promotion. And unless advertisers are paying Instagram for the information, they typically have to rely on screenshots from influencers for data on how many people saw a post. Influencers like Ms. Latimer said that even then, not all brands request those screenshots. Tyler Stark, director of marketing at Traeger Grills, said that many influencers, particularly on Facebook, reach only 2 percent of their audience. That has made smaller influencers more appealing and put a focus on engagement, he said, with the thought that a post with a large number of likes and comments will end up in the feeds of more people. Still, Bob Gilbreath, chief executive of Ahalogy, a marketing technology company in Cincinnati, said that he recently heard a major retailer recommend that brands work only with influencers who have at least 200,000 followers. “Most brands would say that a follower is someone who’s definitely going to see the post,” Mr. Gilbreath said. “Not only are most people not seeing the posts even if they’re real people, but many of them are not real people.” Soapbox Influencer Marketing, a company that connects brands with influencers, features a case study on its website for a new hummus from Bush’s Beans. The site claims that the campaign, which featured 519 influencer posts, resulted in a whopping 891 million impressions — nearly triple the American population. When asked about the figure, Beth Stephens, the company’s president, said it was “incorrectly listed on our website and needs to be corrected.” She added that Bush’s Beans also worked with “a number of other influence and social service providers,” making it difficult for Soapbox to directly assess the figure. Bush’s Beans didn’t return requests for comment. Others tout the “total reach” of fashion and food influencers on their websites. In other types of media and Instagram’s own business analytics, “reach” refers to the number of different people who actually saw an ad. But in influencer marketing, it often refers to an aggregation of followers across platforms and can even include monthly unique visitors to blogs. Mr. Gilbreath is still a proponent of the work that comes out of social media mavens, but has instead focused on hiring creative “micro” influencers with 10,000 or more followers. The firm pays to promote their recipes or tips and tracks subsequent visits to their websites, he said, adding that the data is otherwise too unreliable. Corey Martin, head of influencer marketing at 360i, said that the agency was increasingly paying Instagram to promote posts from influencers, which allows the agency to “track and trace consumer behavior in a way we previously hadn’t.” Some hope for more action from Instagram, especially since it plans to restrict access to some of its data later this year, which may impede the work of bot-hunters like Dovetale. “It will be unfair until Instagram really just cleans out the bots and the lurkers,” said Caitlin Sakdalan, who runs the account @BeFatBeHappy. “There’s so many different programs that people use and algorithms and we can all say this and all say that, but until Instagram itself kind of does it for the community, I think it will be an unfair playing field.” Email Sapna Maheshwari at sapna@nytimes.com or follow her on Twitter: @sapna.

 Good Monday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Trump puts an end to Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm. • David Solomon is Goldman Sachs’s heir apparent. • Can Solomon get Goldman playing a new tune? • Apple agrees to buy Texture. • Short Netflix • Dropbox unveils its I.P.O. target. Get this in your inbox every morning. Sign up here. President Trump on Monday blocked Broadcom’s bid for the chip maker Qualcomm, citing national security concerns. In a presidential order, Mr. Trump said “there is credible evidence” that led him to believe Singapore-based Broadcom’s control of Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, “might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.” Advertisement The extraordinary action by the president underscored the more forceful and protectionist action his administration has taken in recent weeks to protect American companies and ward off foreign investment in the United States. It followed an intervention this month by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which typically works behind closed doors and reviews deals only after they are announced, to stall the deal because of national security concerns. Advertisement From President Trump’s order: (a) There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that Broadcom Limited, a limited company organized under the laws of Singapore (Broadcom), along with its partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates, including Broadcom Corporation, a California corporation, and Broadcom Cayman L.P., a Cayman Islands limited partnership, and their partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates (together, the Purchaser), through exercising control of Qualcomm Incorporated (Qualcomm), a Delaware corporation, might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States; and (b) Provisions of law, other than section 721 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), do not, in my judgment, provide adequate and appropriate authority for me to protect the national security in this matter. Further down (e) The Purchaser and Qualcomm shall immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover. Immediately upon completion of all steps necessary to terminate the proposed takeover of Qualcomm, the Purchaser and Qualcomm shall certify in writing to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) that such termination has been effected in accordance with this order and that all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the proposed takeover of Qualcomm have been completed. Most C.E.O.s have to go to work each day and grind out better margins in highly competitive businesses that taxpayers won’t bail out if they blow up. This is now the fate that awaits the next C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs. In apparently priming David M. Solomon for the job, Goldman seems to be signaling that, even if trading revenue revives after some difficult quarters, it intends to press on with its efforts to bolster its nontrading businesses, like lending to corporations and consumers. Mr. Solomon, after a successful run as the head of Goldman’s powerful deal-making business, embodies in many ways the bank’s hopes to be far more than a high-octane trading shop. Of course, if the Trump administration guts Wall Street regulations, particularly the Volcker Rule, Goldman may be tempted to pile back into trading. But the bank’s recent track record in trading suggests that would not be a good idea. Not only does Goldman’s business that trades bonds, derivatives, currencies and commodities bounce around too much for shareholders’ tastes, it is opaque. Bank executives are often loath to talk in detail when it underperforms. Goldman also made strategic mistakes in this business in recent years. It focused too heavily on hedge fund clients, something it is trying to fix by reaching out to different types of customers. Its commodities business, which it clung to in the face of political pressure, has been a drawn out disappointment. And Wall Street traders ought not to get too excited about the prospects of deregulation. As some rules get loosened, others may get toughened up, like those that would liquidate a troubled Wall Street firm rather than bail it out. While the government may not be winding down any large banks anytime soon, the diminished likelihood of bailouts can force up the cost of borrowing for firms like Goldman. This, in turn, may steer them away from riskier businesses like trading. Investors still seem to doubt Goldman’s desire to adapt to a much more ordinary future. This is revealed in a comparison of Goldman and its rival, Morgan Stanley. Advertisement Goldman’s return on shareholder equity, a closely watched metric that quantifies the profits generated on shareholders’ money, has been higher than that of Morgan Stanley in recent years. But investors seem just as enthusiastic about the future of Morgan Stanley. Its stock trades at the same multiple to shareholders equity as Goldman’s. Why? Morgan Stanley has arguably done more than Goldman to diversify away from trading to businesses, like wealth management, that are more stable. — Peter Eavis David M. Solomon is Goldman Sachs’s heir apparent. The Wall Street firm said Mr. Solomon would serve as its sole president and chief operating officer, setting him up as the potential successor to Lloyd C. Blankfein, the investment bank’s longtime chief executive. Context Mr. Solomon and Harvey M. Schwartz were seen as the favorites to eventually replace Mr. Blankfein when they were named co-chief operating officers and presidents in December 2016. But, Mr. Schwartz, who previously served as the bank’s chief financial officer and global co-head of the securities division, has decided to retire in April, Goldman said on Monday. “Harvey has been a mentor to many, and his influence has made an indelible impact on generations of professionals at Goldman Sachs,” Mr. Blankfein said in a news release. “I want to thank Harvey for all he’s done for the firm.” Mr. Solomon joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 and previously served as co-head of its investment banking division. — Chad Bray Critic’s corner Anthony Currie of Breakingviews writes: “If Solomon does take the reins, it would end some 12 years of traders holding top positions at the Wall Street firm – and serve as another sign of Goldman’s troubles in that business.” Case in point: • Trading accounted for 53 percent of Goldman’s revenue in 2012. • It made just over a third of the firm’s revenue last year. Advertisement “Meanwhile, takings from merger advisory and stock-and-bond underwriting – Solomon’s world – increased by half over the past six years. So positioning him as likely heir would look like a way of rewarding past success.” Goldman’s reputation for advising companies in mergers and acquisitions is well earned. Most years, it tops the rankings of advisers by deal volume known as the league tables. So it was a bit surprising to see Goldman currently ranked fifth on both the global and the United States league tables. Here’s a look: Global  Morgan Stanley: $228.88 billion JPMorgan: $198.82 billion Bank of America Merrill Lynch: $138.76 billion Lazard: $134.39 billion Goldman Sachs: $131.56 billion United States Morgan Stanley: $132.36 billion Lazard: $119.69 billion JPMorgan: $114.37 billion Centerview: $112.75 billion Goldman Sachs: $102.54 billion Two points to note: 1) It is still early in the year and one big deal can reshuffle the rankings; 2) The value of transactions Goldman has advised on this year is up 31 percent from the same period a year ago. Larry Kudlow emerged Monday as the latest favorite in a changing rotation of potential replacements for Gary D. Cohn as the head the National Economic Council. The job has not been formally offered to Mr. Kudlow, but the CNBC television commentator, who has informally advised President Trump on economic issues, is likely to interview him in the coming days. Context From the NYT’s Maggie Haberman and Jim Tankersley:  Heading into the weekend, the top contender to replace Mr. Cohn was Christopher Liddell, who is a special assistant to the president working with the Office of American Innovation on a team led by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser. Mr. Liddell’s previous experience as a chief financial officer for Microsoft had been seen as a selling point. But after The New York Times reported that Mr. Liddell was under consideration, Mr. Trump received pushback from people both inside and outside the White House, according to the people close to the president. On Monday, The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board wrote a piece critical of Mr. Liddell’s views on free trade. On Sunday, Mr. Trump again began discussing Mr. Kudlow as an option, the people close to the president said. In a revised prospectus filed this morning, the online storage company said that it planned to sell 36 million shares at $16 to $18 a share. At the midpoint of that range, Dropbox would be valued at about $7.5 billion, compared to the $10 billion of its most recent private fund-raising. Advertisement The big thought: The Dropbox offering — along with that of Spotify — could show how interested Wall Street investors are in the latest batch of Silicon Valley “unicorns,” or privately held companies worth at least $1 billion. The man who made Dropbox: Meet Drew Houston, who created a multibillion-dollar business because he forgot to bring a USB flash drive one day while a student at M.I.T. His holdings could be worth nearly $1.7 billion The market for initial public offerings is on a tear, and, going by Dropbox’s latest financial filing, it may be getting a little overheated. Dropbox, a company that stores files on remote computers for consumers and businesses, on Monday said it aims to price its shares at between $16 and $18. The midpoint of those two prices would value Dropbox at around $6.8 billion, excluding some shares that may be awarded to executives in the future. That’s a lot, though about 30 percent below the $10 billion valuation it received after its fundraising round in 2014. At $6.8 billion, Dropbox would be trading at just over six times the $1.1 billion in sales it had for 2017. Companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index trade at 2.3 times sales. Dropbox would also have a higher valuation than Box, another file storage company, whose market value is 5.6 times the revenue it generated in its last fiscal year, which ended in January. Investors may, however, decide that Dropbox’s higher valuation is not justified. True, its sales grew at an impressive 31 percent last year, but that is not materially faster than the 27 percent Box achieved in its latest fiscal year. (Revenue grew 6.3 percent at companies in the S.&P. 500, according to FactSet.) Advertisement Neither company made a profit in their most recent fiscal year. Both are generating positive cash flows, though. And at $330 million last year, Dropbox’s cash flows were more than five times those of Box’s $62 million. If Dropbox went public at the $6.8 billion implied in Monday’s filing, it would trade at 21 times its 2017 cash flows. That is pricey, but that is less than half of Box’s cash flow multiple. — Peter Eavis Speculation has long swirled that Apple should buy Netflix. On Monday, the iPhone maker agreed to buy Texture, the “Netflix of magazines.” Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . The digital magazine app offers users a $10 a month subscription to read more than 200 magazines, including People, the New Yorker, Vanity Fair, and Vogue. The deal is part of Apple’s effort to bolster its services businesses. The WSJ reports: Apple has set a goal of increasing total revenue from services to more than $40 billion by 2020. The company generated nearly $30 billion in services revenue in its fiscal year ended in September. The Texture transaction follows Apple’s deal for Shazam, the music recognition app, in December. Texture is owned by Next Issue Media, a joint-venture between Condé Nast, Hearst, Meredith, News Corp, Rogers Media and K.K.R. Apple did not disclose the price. Shares of the video streaming company are down 3.4 percent Monday to about $320 after the short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research tweeted that he thinks the stock can be ”shorted back to $300.”

From the outside, the Saudi businessmen (including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal) who were corralled into Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton — in what Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described as an anticorruption campaign — seemed to be in a gilded cage. The reality was far more disturbing. Many were physically abused and one captive was killed, witnesses told the NYT. The Saudi government extracted billions of dollars of assets from detainees to set them free. More from Ben Hubbard, David Kirkpatrick, Kate Kelly and Mark Mazzetti of the NYT: One former detainee, forced to wear a tracking device, has sunk into depression as his business collapses. “We signed away everything,” a relative of his said. “Even the house I am in, I am not sure if it is still mine.” The net effect: Many outside investors, whom Saudi officials have hoped to woo to help transform the kingdom’s economy, are now rattled by what they say was a lack of transparency.

Elsewhere in the kingdom: Aramco is more likely to go public next year than late this year as originally expected, Michael reported yesterday. Among the issues is that much of the work in pulling off the biggest I.P.O. in history has yet to be finished. Students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School took out a full-page ad in the NYT over the weekend to thank businesses “who acted on their consciences and took positive steps for change” after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. Among the companies thanked: BlackRock, Bumble, Delta, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Gucci, Kroger, REI and Walmart.

Among them: Salle Yoo, Uber’s longtime top lawyer, and Rachel Whetstone, the company’s communications head, who have both since left the company. And then there was Bill Gurley of the investment firm Benchmark. According to the article: As Gurley pondered his options, he received an email that kicked him in the gut. It was from Katrina Lake, C.E.O. of the apparel-shopping service Stitch Fix, one of Benchmark’s other highly successful portfolio companies. Lake lambasted Gurley for not doing enough to fix Uber.
