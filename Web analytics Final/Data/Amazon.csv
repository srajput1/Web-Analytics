 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has recalled some of its portable chargers in the United States following reports of overheating and fire, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) said on Tuesday. The watchdog for safety and quality of consumer products in the United States said about 260,000 units of six kinds of power banks - manufactured in China by Guoguang Electric Co Ltd for Amazon's 'Basics' lineup - were part of the recall. (http://bit.ly/2p93va0) Amazon has received 53 reports of these power banks overheating, which include incidents of battery acid burns and property damage from fire. The CPSC statement added that Amazon is in contact with users who have purchased these items. Amazon was not immediately available for comment.

 PARIS —  Privately-held French supermarket operator Leclerc said on Tuesday it would launch a food delivery service in Paris this month, stepping up its offering in the face of competition from Amazon and domestic rivals. Amazon's purchase of upmarket U.S. food chain Whole Foods last year has prompted speculation the online giant could focus on the European food and supermarket sector next, with some analysts seeing France as prime target. ""We will rise up to the challenge, starting with home delivery in Paris. Amazon are the kings of logistics, the kings of IT and algorithms,"" chief executive Michel-Edouard Leclerc told France Info radio. ""But I have a trust relationship with consumers. I think commercial policy will prevail."" Leclerc has overtaken Carrefour as the leading food retailer in France by market share, partly because its prices are typically lower than its rivals. Advertisement The new service, to be called 'Leclerc Chez Moi' (Leclerc To My Door), will be launched on March 26 in northern Paris and from May 15 in the south of the city. Advertisement It will price products at 15-20 percent below those of competitors with a goal of generating revenue equivalent to a hypermarket in the first year. ""The Leclerc division is coming to Paris and it will free up prices,"" Leclerc said in reference to the French 2nd Armored Division, headed by General Philippe Leclerc (not a relative), who liberated Paris during World War Two.  . CASINO SEES NO THREAT FROM LECLERC IN PARIS Questioned about the impact of Leclerc's plans on the performance of its Franprix and Monoprix convenience stores in Paris, Casino CEO Jean Charles Naouri told analysts last week he was not overly worried. ""The Paris food market is worth 7 billion euros and Leclerc thinks it can generate a food revenue of 170 million euros. This will have a limited impact of 1 percent on the revenue of Monoprix and Franprix,"" he said. Amazon, which has run its Amazon Prime express delivery service in Paris since 2016, is steadily building up its presence in France. Privately-held French supermarket operator Systeme U recently disclosed it was in discussions over a grocery supply deal with Amazon. Faced with the challenge from the U.S. giant, France's retailers have been looking to improve their online offerings. In January Carrefour unveiled plans to boost its e-commerce investment and said it would seek a partnership in China with Tencent. In November, Casino said it would use British online retailer Ocado's e-commerce platform to help expand.

 WASHINGTON —  First lady Melania Trump is bringing together tech giants to talk about ways to fight cyberbullying and promote internet safety, representatives of three companies said Tuesday. Among the companies expected to attend the March 20 meeting: Amazon, Snap, Facebook, Google and Twitter. The meeting was confirmed by Amazon and representatives of two companies speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the plans publicly. Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Trump, said in a statement that Mrs. Trump ""has simply asked for a meeting to discuss one of the many things that impacts children — as she has done many times in the past, on several different topics."" The meeting, first reported by The Washington Post, would mark Mrs. Trump's first public event on a subject she has previously expressed interest in. During the first year of her husband's administration, she played a low-key role. Advertisement Her interest in children has been clear, with visits to schools and hospitals. In her first public remarks at the United Nations last year, Mrs. Trump called on world leaders to come together for the good of their children, saying: ""We must remember that they are watching and listening, so we must never miss an opportunity to teach life's many ethical lessons along the way.""  . During the presidential campaign, Melania Trump mentioned doing work to address bullying — a notable choice given the president-elect's penchant for name-calling on social media.

 A CORUNA, Spain —  Zara, the fashion chain owned by the world's biggest clothing retailer Inditex, will introduce augmented reality displays from April, it said on Tuesday, in an effort to lure millennials into its stores. Clothing retailers are having to invest in memorable product demonstrations and store-specific content to attract customers in their twenties and early thirties, whose increasing use of online players such as Amazon has ravaged bricks-and-mortar retail chains in recent years. Zara's latest technological push shows models wearing selected looks from its ranges when a mobile phone is held up to a sensor within the store or designated shop windows, with customers able to click through to buy the clothes. Inditex, known for whisking the latest fashions from catwalk to store rails in a matter of days, has weathered the onslaught from online rivals relatively well, analysts say. Advertisement ""It is now very rare in the physical stores-based part of the retail sector to find companies not disrupted by online,"" Anne Critchlow, of Societe Generale, said in a recent note.  . ""However, Inditex is a rare example of a company that should fare relatively well."" Rival H&M is also investing in technology for enhanced customer engagement, it said at an investors' day in February.

 Call it the “Big Little Lies” effect. Within 45 minutes on Monday night, there were separate announcements that Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman, stars of the Emmy Award-winning HBO series, will serve as executive producers and stars of two new projects. Ms. Witherspoon struck a deal to adapt the best-selling novel “Little Fires Everywhere,” by Celeste Ng, as a limited series for the streaming service Hulu. Ms. Witherspoon’s production company, Hello Sunshine, initiated the project and will produce it in conjunction with Kerry Washington’s Simpson Street and ABC Signature Studios. In addition to Ms. Witherspoon, the show will star Ms. Washington, the actress best known for her work on the ABC series “Scandal.” Ms. Kidman reached an agreement with HBO with her project, a limited series called “The Undoing,” based on the novel “You Should Have Known”, by Jean Hanff Korelitz. The veteran television hitmaker David E. Kelley, who has written every episode of “Big Little Lies,” will produce the show with Ms. Kidman, along with Bruna Papandrea, Ms. Witherspoon’s former producing partner. In the year since “Big Little Lies” premiered, Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Kidman have moved a number of projects toward production, including a second season of “Big Little Lies,” for which they persuaded Meryl Streep to join the cast. Advertisement The two Oscar winners’ moves into the ranks of powerful producers have been helped along by an entertainment industry that has changed dramatically with the entry of Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and Apple into the realm of big-budget series. The streaming platforms, eager to upend the old television order, are hungry for stars and spending freely to get them. HBO must join the competition if it hopes to maintain its position as a premium cable outlet for A-list programming. Advertisement The limited-series genre has been a hit with movie stars who prefer not to be tied into programs that can last for years. It is also popular with demanding audiences that may lose patience with a show at the first sign of narrative drift. Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Kidman are also taking advantage of an industry motivated by the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements to do a better job of telling stories of strong, complex women, in a space that has long been dominated by scowling male detectives, goofy sitcom dads and tortured antiheroes. In an interview with The New York Times this year, Ms. Witherspoon said it was not until September’s Emmys ceremony — during which “Big Little Lies” won multiple awards — that her phone started ringing in earnest. “I think it just clicked in people’s minds that this works economically and critically and that it was very well received,” Ms. Witherspoon said. Amazon, Hulu and Apple all showed serious interest in “Little Fires Everywhere,” but Hulu came through with the best offer.  . The platform — which is owned jointly by the Walt Disney Company, 21st Century Fox, Comcast and Time Warner — has some wind at its back after the success of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” which became the first streaming show to win an Emmy for best series. Hulu’s guerrilla marketing efforts for “The Handmaid’s Tale,” which included sending women dressed in red cloaks to walk around New York, Los Angeles and Austin, Tex., particularly impressed Ms. Witherspoon’s team. It probably didn’t hurt that ABC Signature Studios, a co-producer of the series, is owned by Disney, which will be the majority owner of Hulu if its planned acquisition of 21st Century Fox wins government approval. Advertisement “Hulu has a rich history of transforming groundbreaking literature into groundbreaking television, and we are confident that their talented team will use this story to spur a long-overdue dialogue around race, class and what it means to be a mother,” Ms. Witherspoon said in a statement. In addition to her deals with HBO and Hulu, Ms. Witherspoon is producing three shows for Apple — a series about a morning show, with Jennifer Aniston; a drama starring Octavia Spencer; and a comedy starring Kristen Wiig. The loser in Monday night’s pair of deals is ad-supported television. None of the broadcast networks or cable channels with critically acclaimed fare, like FX or AMC, were seriously involved in the bidding for “Little Fires Everywhere” or “The Undoing.” Show creators like sending their work out into the world without commercial interruptions. In the new Hollywood — where Apple is handing out fat checks and Netflix has given huge deals to Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy — creative producers are in very high demand. All they have to do now is make binge-worthy shows.

 WASHINGTON/BEIJING —  U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports and will target the technology and telecommunications sectors, two people who had discussed the issue with the Trump administration said on Tuesday. A third source who had direct knowledge of the administration's thinking said the tariffs, associated with a ""Section 301"" intellectual property investigation, under the 1974 U.S. Trade Act begun in August last year, could come ""in the very near future."" While the tariffs would be chiefly targeted at information technology, consumer electronics and telecoms, they could be much broader and the list could eventually run to 100 products, this person said. The White House declined to comment on the size or timing of any move. Trump is targeting Chinese high technology companies to punish China for its investment policies that effectively force U.S. companies to give up their technology secrets in exchange for being allowed to operate in the country, as well as for other IP practices Washington considers unfair. Advertisement The Trump administration is also considering imposing investment restrictions on Chinese companies over and above the heightened national security restrictions, but details on these were not immediately known. A U.S. Treasury spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Advertisement But lobbyists in Washington expressed concern that Trump's ambitious tariff plan would also include other labor-intensive consumer goods sectors such as apparel, footwear and toys. Higher tariffs on these products would ""hurt American families,"" said Hun Quach, a trade lobbyist for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. ""We're not talking about fancy cashmere sweaters, we're talking about cotton T-Shirts and jeans and shoes that kids wear for back-to-school,"" she added. ""Alarm bells are ringing."" China runs a $375 billion trade surplus with the United States and when President Xi Jinping's top economic adviser visited Washington recently, the administration pressed him to come up with a way of reducing that number. Trump came to office on a promise to shield American workers from imports and his first action as president was to pull the United States out of the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. His administration is in the midst of negotiations to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and last week announced the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. While the tariffs on steel and aluminum, announced last week by Trump, are viewed as relatively insignificant in terms of imports and exports, moves to target China directly risk a direct and harsh response from Beijing. Advertisement ""If this is serious, the Chinese will retaliate. The key question is, does the U.S. retaliate against that retaliation,"" said Derek Scissors, a China trade expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a pro-business think tank. That would spook stock markets, but Scissors said that the more serious the conflict became, the worse China's position would become, due to the importance of its U.S. trade surplus.  . ""Their incentive to negotiate is to head us off from a major trade conflict."" NOT BIG ENOUGH The news website Politico earlier reported that the U.S. Trade Representative's office had presented Trump with a package of $30 billion in tariffs last week, but Trump told aides that this was not high enough. One Washington business source who had discussed the issue with the White House said the figure had now grown to about $60 billion, with a potentially wider array of products under consideration. A second person, who is an industry lobbyist in Washington  familiar with the administration's thinking, said the process was being led by Peter Navarro, an avowed protectionist, and by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who also favors tariffs as a tool to rebalance trade. Speaking to reporters in the Capitol, U.S. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady stressed that Trump was serious about addressing the issue of intellectual property theft with China. ""He's serious about calling their hand on this, and my understanding is they are looking at a broad array of options to do that,"" Brady said. U.S. business groups, while uneasy about triggering Chinese  retaliation, have increasingly pressed Washington to take action on Beijing's industrial policies, such as market access restrictions and the ""Made in China 2025"" plan, which aims to supplant foreign technologies with domestic ones. Shortly after Trump took office, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a U.S. technology think tank whose board includes representatives from top companies such as Apple, Amazon, Cisco, Google, and Intel, called for coordinated international pressure on Beijing. Advertisement While complaints about China's abuse of intellectual property rights are not confined to the United States, Trump's global steel and aluminum tariffs announced last week under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 complicate U.S. efforts to recruit allies to put pressure on China. A senior European diplomat in Beijing said China would be relieved to see Europe and Washington at odds over the metals tariffs. ""China's biggest worry has always been joint push-back from its major Western trading partners,"" the diplomat said. A China-based business source with knowledge of discussion among senior European officials said there had been a ""clear effort"" by the U.S. government over the past six months to introduce a coordinated approach to Chinese industrial policy, but that Trump's metals tariffs had undermined European support. ""Senior Trump administration officials had directly approached European leaders at a senior level. There had been a willingness to do something together on China. That's impossible right now. You can't cooperate when you're getting whacked around,"" the person told Reuters.

 PIERRE, South Dakota —  The woman walked into Cash Hogen's hardware store last fall to ask a single question about a KitchenAid mixer on display: What did the manufacturer call that color scheme? “Tangerine,” replied Hogen. And with that, the woman walked out. It is a kind of customer interaction that happens often these days, said Hogen, who has run his store in Pierre, South Dakota's downtown historic district since 1983. People come in to look at a product, ask a question or two, then leave, presumably to search for it more cheaply online. Retailers even have a name for the practice: “showrooming.”  “It’s just a gut feeling that she’s not buying it from me,” he said. One reason customers shop elsewhere, Hogen says, is that even when he can compete on price, he has to charge sales tax, which ups the ultimate price of his merchandise. The mixer, for example, normally has a $399.99 price tag in Hogen’s store, on top of which he has to charge $26 in state and local sales taxes. Some online retailers sell the mixer at the same price or lower, with no sales tax and free shipping. Advertisement That sales tax differential is at the core of a case that will come before the U.S. Supreme Court on April 17, and the stakes are high not only for store-keepers like Hogen, but also for online retailers, for state governments and for bargain-hunting consumers. Advertisement The case stems from a South Dakota law passed in 2016 by legislators at the state capitol building a few blocks from Hogen's store that requires out-of-state online retailers to collect state sales taxes. The state enacted the law knowing it would be challenged, due to a 1992 Supreme Court ruling in the case of Quill Corp v. North Dakota, which held that states cannot require retailers to collect sales taxes unless they have a “physical presence” in the state. Passing a law certain to draw fire was ""the nuclear option,"" said Republican state Senator Deb Peters, a prominent supporter of the measure, but legislators considered it necessary as internet sales continue to rise. After the law was enacted, the state preemptively sued four online retailers.  Overstock.com Inc, Wayfair Inc and Newegg Inc contested the lawsuits, while the fourth company, Systemax Inc, decided not to. After losing in lower courts, South Dakota appealed to the Supreme Court, which announced in January it would hear the case. The state will argue that the legal precedent dates back to the days of catalog sales and is no longer relevant in the internet age. A ruling in favor of South Dakota could funnel up to $13 billion a year of new tax revenues into the coffers of affected U.S. state governments, according to a 2017 federal government report. It would also make it harder for consumers to find deals online where they can avoid paying sales tax. Advertisement Hogen is following the Supreme Court action, but while a favorable ruling for the state might help him, he said, he knows a single court ruling cannot reverse the e-commerce trend. ""If this sales tax thing goes through, it’s not going to end internet shopping,"" he said. ""That’s here to stay."" ""PHYSICAL PRESENCE"" The rugged, rural, Republican-led state of South Dakota is notoriously stingy when it comes to spending taxpayer dollars. It has no income tax and relies heavily on sales taxes for revenue. The state estimates it loses up to $50 million a year in sales tax on internet purchases, which now account for 8.4 percent of sales nationwide, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. The new law requires out-of-state online retailers to collect sales tax if they clear $100,000 in sales to South Dakota residents or have 200 separate transactions with customers in the state.  . Wayfair, Overstock and Newegg did not respond to requests seeking comment. Amazon.com Inc, the dominant internet sales company, has not taken a position in the legal battle and declined to comment for this story. Amazon has already agreed to collect sales taxes in all 45 states that impose them. The company has not generally collected taxes for items sold on its website by third party vendors, which constitute about half of total sales on the platform, although two states have now enacted laws to require it to do so. The South Dakota law does not directly affect some other large online retailers, such as Walmart Inc. and Macy's Inc., because they have brick-and-mortar stores in the state and so were already required to collect sales tax. Other states have also wrestled with how to collect out-of-state taxes from e-tailers, including New York, which passed a law in 2008 that sought to stretch the definition of “physical presence” without running afoul of the Supreme Court precedent. Advertisement The amount of money states stand to gain from taxing online sales is uncertain. A widely-cited 2009 study by the University of Tennessee, updated in 2012, estimated that $23 billion a year in state and local revenue was being lost nationwide to internet commerce in 2009 and would increase every year. But data from states that have tried to capture online sales tax revenue suggest that number may be high. In New York, for example, the state has said in court papers that between the 2008 passage of its law and February 2012, e-tailers remitted $360 million in sales tax. The University of Tennessee study had estimated that, by 2012, New York could collect nearly twice that amount in a single year by applying state and local sales taxes to internet purchases. In fiscal 2017, South Dakota took in just over $1.4 billion in sales taxes, according to the state's Department of Revenue, which accounted for 71.7 percent of the state’s total revenue. Only Washington state and Tennessee have a higher proportion of sales tax to total tax revenue, according to the Tax Foundation. Despite South Dakota's predictions of major gains, Governor Dennis Daugaard acknowledged in an interview that ""it's really quite difficult to know"" exactly how much additional revenue the state will gain if it wins at the Supreme Court. KENNEDY'S ROLE The impetus for South Dakota's law came from one of the nine people who now hold its fate in their hands: U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. In a 2015 opinion on a related issue, Kennedy questioned the continuing relevance in the internet age of the 1992 Quill ruling that only sellers with a physical presence in a state could be required to collect sales taxes.  He urged those with a stake in the issue to “find an appropriate case for this Court” to reconsider the earlier precedent. A ruling in the case is due by the end of June. Advertisement Carl Szabo, general counsel of NetChoice, an e-commerce trade association urged the court to defer to Congress on the issue, stressing the complexities of allowing states to collect taxes nationwide. ""One of the fears I have is that there’s nothing to limit small businesses from being inundated by demand letters from tax collectors around the country,"" he said.

 NEW YORK —  Walmart Inc will expand its grocery home delivery services to reach more than 40 percent of U.S. households, or 100 metro areas from an existing six, as the retailer steps up a fight against rival Amazon.com Inc. The extra cost may hit Walmart's bottom line, but increased spending on grocery delivery is seen as essential in the fierce battle for online orders for food and household staples. ""It is an absolutely necessary step for them to take in terms of their ability to compete with Amazon in particular,"" said Ken Perkins, founder of research firm Retail Metrics. Walmart said on Wednesday the service would be rolled out by the end of the year. Deliveries will cost $9.95 with a minimum $30 order and companies like Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] will provide transport. Other delivery companies will be added later this year. Advertisement The move will complement Walmart's rollout of curbside grocery pickup, which is currently available in 1,200 stores and will be added to a 1,000 more stores this year. It also allows Walmart to compete with Amazon's two-hour Prime Now service for shoppers of its loyalty program. Advertisement The expanded service should help the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer to get more of its store shoppers to buy items online, where they spend twice as much. Intense competition is sweeping the grocery market, following Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods last year.  . Rivals are also expanding delivery options. Amazon recently debuted free two-hour Prime Now grocery delivery from Whole Foods in four cities, free for its annual $99 Prime subscribers. Kroger Co, the nation's largest supermarket operator, has home delivery from more than 872 stores across the United States, and this week expanded its partnership with delivery company Instacart. Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, has amassed an 18 percent share of the $12.6 billion U.S. online grocery market, mainly through the sale of packaged goods such as pasta and diapers. It is the largest player in a sector that is expected to grow to $41.7 billion by 2022, according to market research firm Packaged Facts. Walmart is No. 2 with 9 percent, followed by Ahold USA's Peapod with 7 percent, FreshDirect with 6 percent and Instacart at 5 percent. Online revenue growth slowed at Walmart in the most recent quarter, causing some analysts to question its strategy to compete with Amazon. Company officials said Walmart was still on track to increase its e-commerce sales by 40 percent this year.

 The path to fast and affordable online grocery service is littered with obstacles: refrigeration challenges, storage woes and high transportation costs, among others. But the country’s largest retailers are convinced that it will lead to a lucrative and largely untapped market. And they are all rushing to dominate it first. Walmart escalated the competition on Wednesday by announcing plans to expand its online grocery delivery service to 100 metropolitan areas by the end of the year. Orders will be fulfilled at more than 800 stores nationwide and shuttled to shoppers by drivers contracted through Uber, Deliv and other ride and delivery platforms. Customers must order at least $30 worth of goods and pay an additional delivery fee of $9.95; they can receive their purchases in as little as four hours if they put in the request by 1 p.m. The plan puts the world’s largest retailer on a direct collision course with the world’s most powerful e-commerce player, Amazon, which purchased the Whole Foods grocery chain for $13.4 billion last summer and recently announced plans to use those stores to fill on-demand orders. Advertisement Other retailers like Costco, Target and Kroger are also joining the increasingly expensive battle for customers who want eggs and milk without leaving their couch. Advertisement “There is a lot of experimenting going on as everyone tries to figure out that last-mile delivery — it’s a tough economic equation to make work,” said Mike Knemeyer, a professor of logistics at Ohio State University. “But if you can, you’ll have a big head start on the others, and you’ll end up making money not just in groceries but on all of the things that you sell.” The nexus of e-commerce and grocery sales is increasingly appealing to retailers. “The thing that’s great about grocery is that it’s a pure traffic driver — no matter who you are, you need to get groceries every two weeks, which makes it an exception from all the other categories that keep retailers up at night,” said Matt Sargent, a retail expert at the consulting firm Magid. But while the total grocery market is enormous — nearly $1 trillion annually in the United States — many customers still insist on seeing and touching their food in person before buying. Spending on online groceries is currently just $27 billion a year, or 3 percent of the total, according to Forrester Research, which specializes in technology. Controlling costs is another major challenge. Grocery providers have grappled with the expense of packaging delicate produce and meats in ice packs and dispatching fleets of company-owned vehicles from distribution centers staffed around the clock. Even Amazon has struggled. The company launched its AmazonFresh service in the Seattle area in 2007 and tested it for years before expanding it to more than 20 cities. Customers pay $14.99 a month — in addition to their $99-a-year Prime membership — to have groceries sent directly to them. But late last year, the company decided to pull AmazonFresh from some markets. “There’s no question that online grocery has been a challenge for everyone, including Amazon,” said Sucharita Kodali, an analyst at Forrester. “The reason is it’s just really, really hard to get the last mile going.” But Amazon touched off a flurry of activity with its acquisition of Whole Foods in June. In October, Costco introduced a two-day delivery option for dry groceries and a same-day program for fresh goods through Instacart, a delivery service. Target said in December that it would purchase the online same-day delivery service Shipt for $550 million in cash. Advertisement Amazon, which has several brick-and-mortar grocery options in Seattle, said this month that it had begun to offer same-day delivery of groceries from Whole Foods in six cities and would expand the program to the rest of the country later this year. The program is run through Amazon’s Prime Now service, which relies on contractors to make deliveries in their personal cars within two hours of an order being placed. The service is free to Prime customers, but Amazon automatically adds an optional tip. Kroger soon followed Amazon’s lead with an announcement that it would expand the number of cities eligible for home delivery of groceries through Instacart. Walmart’s Sam’s Club division, which said last month it would offer members free shipping of online orders for an annual $100 fee, also uses Instacart. But Walmart said that it would not tap Instacart for the grocery delivery program at its Walmart stores, which it said would reach more than 40 percent of American households. “We’re saving customers time by leveraging new technology, and connecting all the parts of our business into a single seamless shopping experience: great stores, easy pickup, fast delivery, and apps and websites that are simple to use,” Greg Foran, the chief executive of Walmart U.S., said in a statement.  . The company has made substantial investments in its growing suite of online offerings, including a partnership with Google to sell Walmart products on Google Express and the creation of Store No. 8, an internal venture to help develop new online businesses. In the fall, Walmart bought Parcel, a 24-hour delivery service that uses algorithms and leased vehicles to send perishable and nonperishable products to customers in New York City. On Wednesday, Walmart also reiterated that it planned to expand its curbside grocery pickup service to 1,000 more locations this year, in addition to the 1,200 locations where it is already offered. The service allows customers to order food online and collect it at Walmart stores. But Walmart’s e-commerce success has sometimes been fickle — its online sales increased 23 percent in its most recent quarter, less than half the rate of growth in each of the previous three quarters and a performance that sent a ripple of nervousness through the stock market. 
            How customers of some major grocery retailers said they used online ordering.         MARCH 14, 2018
 Walmart’s expanded delivery service requires that customers visit the company’s website or grocery app to place orders. The chain will then have one of its 18,000 personal shoppers collect the selected items in stores. Advertisement Each of those employees — along with the thousands more that Walmart said it would add this year — undergoes a three-week training program that teaches them how to pick the best meats and produce. As specialists, they are paid more than the company’s entry-level workers. Beefing up its grocery delivery service is an “informed gamble” for Walmart, Mr. Knemeyer said — one that will most likely serve up side benefits such as data collection and inroads with young, affluent city dwellers. The chain, long known as a discount retailer, has lately been trying to broaden its appeal. It spent $3.3 billion acquiring Jet.com, a bulk online retailer that Walmart said would give it access to “urban and millennial customers.” In 2017, it purchased the hip e-commerce brands Bonobos and ModCloth. Last month, it unveiled what it called an “Instagram-worthy” collection of mattresses and bedding, available through a separate website. But the supercenters for which Walmart is best known tend to exist on the outskirts of cities and in rural areas. Breaking into metropolitan grocery ecosystems, which often support an already robust network of delivery services for grocery chains and restaurants alike, could be difficult, experts said. And the feature of groceries that make them so attractive to retailers — they are regularly consumed and so must be regularly replenished — makes most consumers unwilling to splurge on them. Walmart’s $9.95 fee on each order is a much more visible cost to consumers compared to Amazon’s annual $99 fee for its Prime membership, which many shoppers set to auto-pay and then forget. “They probably just look at the relatively high delivery fee and get scared off,” said Matthias Winkenbach, director of M.I.T.’s Megacity Logistics Lab. “Walmart would have to do a very good job communicating the overall economics of shopping their everyday low prices versus Amazon.” Follow Tiffany Hsu and Nick Wingfield on Twitter: @TiffkHsu and @NickWingfield.

 NEW YORK —  Walmart is expanding its same-day online grocery delivery service to more than 40 percent of U.S. households, or 100 metro areas, by year-end as it tries to keep pace with online leader Amazon.com. The service is currently available in six markets. Tom Ward, vice president of Walmart's digital operations, says the retail giant is powering the expansion of its same-day delivery service using its online grocery pickup program. That service uses personal shoppers to select items and then take them to shoppers' cars parked at the curb. So far, Walmart offers curbside grocery pickup at 1,200 stores and plans to accelerate the rollout to 2,200 by year-end. It's currently using 18,000 personal shoppers. Walmart says it will continue to use of ride-hailing services like Uber to deliver the goods to shoppers' homes as it expands its service. Advertisement Shoppers pay a flat fee of $9.95 but are required to spend at least $30 per order. Walmart Inc. has also been testing a service using its U.S. store workers to drop off general merchandise like toys and bedding to customers' homes after they finish work. Advertisement Ward noted that Walmart is learning from its delivery services in such countries as China and the United Kingdom.  . Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods Market last year has raised the stakes in the highly competitive grocery delivery wars. Amazon recently added free two-hour Whole Foods delivery to six cities, including Atlanta, Dallas and Cincinnati for its Prime members who pay $99 a year. Meanwhile, grocery startup Instacart has been expanding its roster of clients including B.J.'s and Kroger. And Target, through its acquisition of grocery delivery startup Shipt last year, is expanding same-day delivery of such items as groceries and electronics to nearly every major market by the holiday shopping season. ___ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio at http://www.Twitter.com/adinnocenzio .

 LONDON — Toys “R” Us said on Wednesday that it would close all of its stores in Britain after failing to find a buyer, another ominous sign for a once-dominant toy retailer that has struggled under pressure from Amazon and other online sellers. The company, which filed for bankruptcy in the United States last year, said it would close its remaining 75 stores in Britain in addition to the 25 it has already shut. Toys “R” Us has also closed more than 100 stores in the United States in hopes of avoiding liquidation. The company is owned by the private equity firms Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the real estate firm Vornado Realty Trust. The British arm of the toy seller went into administration, which is similar to a bankruptcy, in February. It had set a deadline of Wednesday to find a buyer for its remaining stores. Advertisement “We have made every effort to secure a buyer for all or part of the company’s business,” Simon Thomas, the joint administrator for the British arm, said in a news release. “This process attracted some interest, but ultimately no party has been able to move forward with a formal bid prior to the expiration of the stated deadline.”  . The administrator said the company’s remaining 75 Toys “R” Us and Babies “R” Us stores would stay open to sell off existing stock, and that the process of closing them would take about six weeks. Advertisement About 67 people lost their jobs at the British arm’s headquarters on Wednesday, the administrator said. The company has about 2,500 employees in Britain. The British arm of Toys “R” Us is the latest retailer to be forced to close or go into administration as changing consumer habits have pushed more purchases online. Maplin, a seller of consumer electronics, collapsed into administration in February. BHS, a large department store fixture throughout Britain, went into administration and closed its stores in 2016.

 Toys “R” Us, the iconic retail chain that has sold toys and games to millions of children for generations, is closing shop in the United States. After filing for bankruptcy protection in September and suffering through a brutal holiday shopping season, the company decided on Wednesday to close or sell all of its remaining stores, after executives met with creditors throughout the day, according to three people briefed on the discussions. More than 30,000 American jobs are at risk as the company winds down. It is a colossal failure for a company that started out in 1948 as a small store in Washington selling cribs, strollers and other baby items. The business eventually grew to more than 2,000 stores, with a wide inventory that made it a destination for children and with an advertising jingle — “I don’t want to grow up, I’m a Toys ‘R’ Us kid” — that was embedded in the American consumer consciousness. The company’s headquarters in Wayne, N.J., are on Geoffrey Way, named after its once-ubiquitous giraffe mascot. Advertisement But in the age of internet retailing, Toys “R” Us has struggled with an antiquated sales model that could not keep up with Amazon and Walmart, and was burdened by $5 billion in debt from a leveraged buyout in 2005. Advertisement “They were at the intersection of so many challenging trends, and they were at the wrong end of those trends,” said Michael Dart, a retail expert and a partner at the consulting firm A. T. Kearney. “All of these forces coming together fundamentally tipped them over the edge.” Liquidation sales will take place over the next few months, as the company clears the shelves at its roughly 880 Toys “R” Us and Babies “R” Us stores around the country. The company signaled that it was nearing the end when it said Wednesday morning that it would shut all of its stores in Britain. In the afternoon, executives informed corporate staff in Wayne about the decision to close the United States stores. The global toy industry has been fighting a losing battle for the attention of children obsessed with smartphones and tablets. Global toy sales have been growing slightly each year, but at a slower pace than that of electronics and video games. In addition, online toy sales have increased by more than 55 percent in the past two years to $17 billion in the United States, while e-commerce revenue for toys has exceeded brick-and-mortar performance in parts of Europe, according to Clavis Insight, an e-commerce research firm. After filing for Chapter 11 protection, Toys “R” Us had planned to shed some of its debt load and refresh its operations. But after a languid holiday sales season, the company’s lenders grew worried about whether Toys “R” Us executives were taking steps drastic enough to restructure the business to allow it to compete over the long term, according to the people briefed on the matter. Advertisement In recent weeks, the creditors had begun to lose patience with the management and its turnaround efforts, these people said. In January, the company said it was closing 182 unprofitable stores in the United States and had already started liquidating those locations.  . But a total liquidation of its United States operations, the creditors calculated, may allow them to recover more money than keeping the stores open. The company was bought in 2005 by the private equity firms Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the real estate firm Vornado Realty Trust. Weighed down by the debt that its owners heaped on the company when they bought it, Toys “R” Us has not adequately invested in its fading stores and e-commerce operations. Unable to compete with other retailers, it has lost market share to better capitalized toy sellers. Toys “R” Us controlled 13.6 percent of the toy market in the United States in 2016, according to research from IBISWorld. Walmart held 29.4 percent, Amazon 16.3 percent and GameStop 13.9 percent. For many analysts, Toys “R” Us was a textbook example of disruption by internet retailers — a giant that once appeared invincible, but whose advantage disappeared as consumers went online for wider selections, lower prices and the ease of buying with a click. Even before the news on Wednesday, the company’s financial collapse had taken a toll on workers like Dyann Rosales, who got a seasonal job at the Toys “R” Us in Pittsburg, Calif., before Christmas and then was hired full time. “This was the chance for me to get out of the hole I had been in,” said Ms. Rosales, 48, who has an 8-year-old daughter. “This was going to be my steppingstone.” Advertisement But she was informed by letter in early February that her store was one of the 182 that would be closing for good. The company had originally said it planned to pay severance to many laid-off employees, Ms. Rosales said. But then she was told that was not likely to happen. “I am back in that pit,” she said. OUR, a labor group focused on retail workers across the country, had been trying to help Toys “R” Us workers receive severance pay and find new jobs. Ms. Rosales said customers had also been saddened by the store’s closing. She recalled an 8-year-old boy who came into the store on his birthday. As a tradition, a store manager announces over the loudspeaker when a birthday boy or girl is in the store and plays a special birthday song. “When the mother heard that, she looked at me and said, ‘This is what we are going to miss,’” Ms. Rosales said.

 (Reuters) - Online platforms such as Google, Apple and Amazon face new European Union rules on their commercial practices with smaller businesses that use their services, as Brussels seeks to curtail their huge market power. The European Commission is drafting a new regulation specifically targeting online platforms such as e-commerce sites, app stores and search engines that will require the companies to be more transparent about how they rank search results and why they delist some services. The proposal seeks to address potentially harmful trading practices by online platforms and a lack of effective redress mechanisms for smaller businesses that use them to reach consumers. ""Online intermediation services can hold superior bargaining power over their business users, enabling them to behave unilaterally in a way that is capable of harming the businesses using them,"" the draft regulation, seen by Reuters, says. Advertisement Tech companies have faced significant regulatory pressure from Brussels, be it over their handling of swathes of user data, how much they pay in taxes or the proliferation of extremist content on social media. Advertisement The proposal was initially meant to exclude search engines such as Alphabet Inc's Google and Microsoft's Bing, but these will now be included given the impact a business's ranking in search results can have on its revenues. The EU's antitrust chief in June hit Google with a record 2.42 billion euro ($2.99 billion) fine for favoring its own shopping service over those of rivals.  . Under the proposal, operators of search engines, app stores as well as e-commerce sites such as eBay will have to specify upfront the ""most important parameters determining ranking"", such as ""specific signals incorporated into algorithms"" and adjustment or demotion mechanisms. The proposal will not force companies to disclose their algorithms but just provide descriptions at a general level explaining ""how and to what extent the relevant ranking mechanism takes account of the quality of the products and services offered"". Online platforms will also have to implement a notice period of at least 15 days for changes to their terms and conditions as well as provide businesses with an ""individualized"" description of the reasons for which they have been de-listed or suspended - for example from Apple's App Store or Google Play. Where companies have their own services competing with other businesses on their platforms - for example Google's own comparison shopping service in Google search results - their terms and conditions will have to include a description of any preferential treatment they give to their own service including access to consumer data and ranking. The proposal is expected to be published in April, after which it will have to be agreed by national governments and the European Parliament.

 Warby Parker opened its website eight years ago and quickly became one of the inspirations for a generation of e-commerce brands aiming at a younger, hipper customer base. Now the eyewear retailer has raised another slug of money — with some coming from a big investor with a history of investing in companies that are close to a stock market listing. Warby Parker announced on Wednesday that it had raised $75 million in a new round of financing led by T. Rowe Price, the mutual fund company, and including Baillie Gifford, the asset manager. It also disclosed that it had added Youngme Moon, a professor at Harvard Business School who sits on the board of Unilever, as a new director. The round values Warby Parker at about $1.7 billion, excluding the new investment, according to a person briefed on the matter. It offers the latest sign of support for the company as it expands its eyewear business. Advertisement “We see really big opportunities to invest against,” Dave Gilboa, one of Warby Parker’s co-founders, said in an interview in the company’s two-floor headquarters in downtown Manhattan. Advertisement Founded by students at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, it now has more than 1,400 employees and 65 retail stores in the United States and Canada. Its focus on design, customer service and a cultivated quirkiness have become a blueprint of sorts for other consumer brands. Harry’s, the maker of grooming products, shares a co-founder with the eyewear company and was once known as the Warby Parker of shaving. Casper, the mattress seller, was once known as the Warby Parker of sleep. Warby Parker was also an early proponent of shifting beyond selling only online to opening brick-and-mortar stores. Figuring out how to balance e-commerce and physical retailing has become perhaps one of the biggest priorities for retailers around the world. Amazon has bought Whole Foods. Walmart, which has made online sales a priority, has acquired Jet and has devoted enormous resources to digital sales.  . Neil Blumenthal, another of Warby Parker’s co-founders, said the company hoped to focus on pleasing customers rather than sticking to a single way of selling glasses. “We’re experience-focused but medium-agnostic,” he said. But technology is a key part of its business. It has added apps that let customers get prescriptions through their smartphones or use the iPhone X’s advanced front-facing camera to pick out which frames are most flattering on their faces. It has also set up an optical lab in Sloatsburg, N.Y., to help produce the lenses for its eyeglasses. The company has also slowly worked toward attaining profitability. Mr. Gilboa said that 2018 will be the retailer’s first full year of turning a profit. To help finance its continued growth, however, Warby Parker turned to T. Rowe Price, which had already invested in the company. That the new round was led by a mutual fund giant known for investing in companies on the verge of an initial public offering may raise questions about whether Warby Parker is finally headed toward the stock markets. Mr. Blumenthal said an initial offering was a more likely future step than selling to some bigger company. But he said there were no immediate plans to pursue a public listing.

 LONDON —  British supermarket group Morrisons said on Wednesday it would boost its campaign to recruit more local suppliers, seeking to further differentiate itself in a brutally competitive grocery market. Chief Executive David Potts, who joined Morrisons in 2015 to lead a recovery after it was badly damaged by the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl in its northern heartland and the strategic errors of previous management, said the move reflected consumer demand rather than a direct response to Brexit. ""Customers perceive local to be fresher,"" he told reporters after Morrisons beat forecasts with an 11 percent rise in 2017-18 profit and paid a special dividend, reflecting its confidence in the future. ""Two-thirds of what we sell is British, so we're in tune with that idea, even before we become very local,"" he said. Advertisement In the year to Feb. 4 2018, Morrisons recruited over 200 new local suppliers, defined as within a 35 mile radius of a store, listing 750 new products, such as Plumgarths sausages in its Cumbrian stores in north west England and Edinburgh Gin in Scotland. Advertisement Overall sales of local suppliers' products across Morrisons have increased 50 percent over the last two years. Potts said the initiative had significant scope but declined to give specific targets. ""This business needs to have less national duplication of merchandise and it has to have more local merchandise as we become truly integrated locally in the years ahead,"" he said. ""It sits very nicely with society's view that enough is enough on plastic and that food waste is excessive."" BROADER BUSINESS Morrisons, the smallest of Britain's big four grocers, is trying to broaden its business by improving the performance of its 500 UK stores while also pursuing growth in online and wholesale markets. Based in the northern English city of Bradford, the group  made an underlying pretax profit of 374 million pounds ($522.6 million) on revenue up 5.8 percent to 17.3 billion pounds.  . The unexpected special dividend of 4 pence per share took its full-year payout to 10.09 pence, up 86 percent. Morrisons' shares gave up early gains to be down 5 percent by 1536 GMT, reflecting concern the profit beat owed more to lower finance costs than strength in the underlying business, and concern over a fall in free cash flow. ""This will temper somewhat the excitement of the special dividend,"" said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne. Advertisement Although discounters are still winning market share, Potts has delivered nine straight quarters of like-for-like sales growth. Morrisons trails clear market leader Tesco, Sainsbury's and Walmart's Asda in annual sales. Potts, who worked for Tesco for 39 years, has overseen a steady improvement in trading, with more competitive prices, improved product ranges and availability as well as better customer service in refurbished stores. He has also overhauled Morrisons' online strategy through a renegotiated agreement with distributor Ocado and struck wholesale supply deals with Amazon, Rontec petrol forecourts, the McColl's convenience chain and Channel Islands retailer Sandpiper. Morrisons said it was on track for its target of 700 million pounds of annualised wholesale sales by the end of 2018, and its medium-term target of 75-125 million pounds of incremental profit from wholesale, services, interest and online.

 WASHINGTON/BEIJING —  U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports and will target the technology and telecommunications sectors, two people who had discussed the issue with the Trump administration said on Tuesday. A third source who had direct knowledge of the administration's thinking said the tariffs, associated with a ""Section 301"" intellectual property investigation, under the 1974 U.S. Trade Act begun in August last year, could come ""in the very near future."" While the tariffs would be chiefly targeted at information technology, consumer electronics and telecoms, they could be much broader and the list could eventually run to 100 products, this person said. The White House declined to comment on the size or timing of any move. In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Sino-U.S. trade relations should not be a zero-sum game, and that the two countries should use ""constructive"" means to manage tension. Advertisement ""We have said many times that China resolutely opposes any kind of unilateral protectionist trade measures,"" Lu told reporters. Advertisement ""If the United States takes actions that harm China's interests, China will have to take measures to firmly protect our legitimate rights."" Trump is targeting Chinese high technology companies to punish China for its investment policies that effectively force U.S. companies to give up their technology secrets in exchange for being allowed to operate in the country, as well as for other IP practices Washington considers unfair. The Trump administration is also considering imposing investment restrictions on Chinese companies over and above the heightened national security restrictions, but details on these were not immediately known. A U.S. Treasury spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But lobbyists in Washington expressed concern that Trump's ambitious tariff plan would also include other labor-intensive consumer goods sectors such as apparel, footwear and toys. Higher tariffs on these products would ""hurt American families,"" said Hun Quach, a trade lobbyist for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. ""We're not talking about fancy cashmere sweaters, we're talking about cotton T-Shirts and jeans and shoes that kids wear for back-to-school,"" she added. ""Alarm bells are ringing."" China runs a $375 billion trade surplus with the United States and when President Xi Jinping's top economic adviser visited Washington recently, the administration pressed him to come up with a way of reducing that number. Advertisement Trump came to office on a promise to shield American workers from imports and his first action as president was to pull the United States out of the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. His administration is in the midst of negotiations to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and last week announced the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. While the tariffs on steel and aluminum, announced last week by Trump, are viewed as relatively insignificant in terms of imports and exports, moves to target China directly risk a direct and harsh response from Beijing. ""If this is serious, the Chinese will retaliate. The key question is, does the U.S. retaliate against that retaliation,"" said Derek Scissors, a China trade expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a pro-business think tank.  . That would spook stock markets, but Scissors said that the more serious the conflict became, the worse China's position would become, due to the importance of its U.S. trade surplus. ""Their incentive to negotiate is to head us off from a major trade conflict."" NOT BIG ENOUGH The news website Politico earlier reported that the U.S. Trade Representative's office had presented Trump with a package of $30 billion in tariffs last week, but Trump told aides that this was not high enough. One Washington business source who had discussed the issue with the White House said the figure had now grown to about $60 billion, with a potentially wider array of products under consideration. A second person, who is an industry lobbyist in Washington  familiar with the administration's thinking, said the process was being led by Peter Navarro, an avowed protectionist, and by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who also favors tariffs as a tool to rebalance trade. Speaking to reporters in the Capitol, U.S. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady stressed that Trump was serious about addressing the issue of intellectual property theft with China. Advertisement ""He's serious about calling their hand on this, and my understanding is they are looking at a broad array of options to do that,"" Brady said. U.S. business groups, while uneasy about triggering Chinese  retaliation, have increasingly pressed Washington to take action on Beijing's industrial policies, such as market access restrictions and the ""Made in China 2025"" plan, which aims to supplant foreign technologies with domestic ones. Shortly after Trump took office, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a U.S. technology think tank whose board includes representatives from top companies such as Apple, Amazon, Cisco, Google, and Intel, called for coordinated international pressure on Beijing. While complaints about China's abuse of intellectual property rights are not confined to the United States, Trump's global steel and aluminum tariffs announced last week under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 complicate U.S. efforts to recruit allies to put pressure on China. A senior European diplomat in Beijing said China would be relieved to see Europe and Washington at odds over the metals tariffs. ""China's biggest worry has always been joint push-back from its major Western trading partners,"" the diplomat said. A China-based business source with knowledge of discussion among senior European officials said there had been a ""clear effort"" by the U.S. government over the past six months to introduce a coordinated approach to Chinese industrial policy, but that Trump's metals tariffs had undermined European support. ""Senior Trump administration officials had directly approached European leaders at a senior level. There had been a willingness to do something together on China. That's impossible right now. You can't cooperate when you're getting whacked around,"" the person told Reuters.

The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday charged Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, with fraud for raising money from investors on the back of false claims about the company’s blood-testing technology. One of Theranos’s main products, called a miniLab, could not perform all the tests the company said it could, the commission asserted. That, according to the complaint, didn’t stop Theranos from claiming that it had a bright future ahead. Advertisement Here are some of the things the commission says Theranos, a private company, did to pull the wool over investors’ eyes. Advertisement It allegedly performed tests on non-Theranos equipment without telling representatives of a pharmacy company that was poised to invest money in the company. Based on Holmes’ presentation, Pharmacy A executives understood that the blood from their demonstration samples would be tested on Theranos’ miniLabs. Holmes never told the executives that Theranos was actually testing some of their blood on modified third party analyzers. Theranos allegedly distributed fake reports by pharmaceutical companies. Investors believed that pharmaceutical companies had written their own endorsements of Theranos’ technology, when the pharmaceutical companies had not. Theranos allegedly made misleading statements about its work with the United States Department of Defense. While Theranos’ technology was used in a D.O.D. burn study, it was never deployed by the D.O.D. in the battlefield, in Afghanistan, or on medevac helicopters. From 2011 to 2014, Holmes had discussions with multiple divisions of the D.O.D. However, Theranos generated only approximately $300,000 from three D.O.D. contracts. Ms. Holmes allegedly told an investor Theranos expected to expand quickly in the stores of a pharmacy chain, but the likelihood of such an expansion was small. Holmes was aware that Theranos’ retail roll out with Pharmacy A was stalled due to, among other issues, some concerns Pharmacy A executives had with regard to Theranos’ performance. The Food and Drug Administration communicated to Theranos that its approval would be needed, but Ms. Holmes allegedly told investors afterward that F.D.A. approval was merely voluntary. Holmes’ statements that Theranos did not need F.D.A. approval or clearance were important to investors because approval or clearance would have been an obstacle in the company’s path to realizing full commercialization. Ms. Holmes allegedly gave investors fake financial results. Holmes also provided historical financial information to one potential investor. In August 2015, Holmes met with a potential investor, during which she provided Theranos’ financial results for fiscal year 2014. These financials showed 2014 net revenues of $108 million, and 2015 and 2016 net revenue projections of $240 million and $750 million, respectively. But Theranos’ actual financial performance bore no resemblance to the financial information Holmes shared with investors. Theranos recorded little more than $100,000 in revenue in 2014 and was nowhere near generating $100 million in revenue by the end of 2014 — Peter Eavis There is an old adage that if it sounds too good to be true, it isn’t. The case filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes describes a litany of falsehoods about a claimed revolutionary method to conduct blood tests that turned out to be pure fiction. Ms. Holmes and the company settled the case, although the former president, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, is fighting the charges. She will pay a $500,000 penalty, return her shares in Theranos, and agreed to a ban on serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years. What makes this case interesting is that Theranos was one of the original unicorns, a private company with a value of more than $1 billion. We usually see the S.E.C. pursue charges against public companies and their executives, while private firms operate largely free from scrutiny – at least until they prepare for an I.P.O. Advertisement The antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, however, apply to any transaction in a security in which there is a misstatement of material fact. Thus, when Theranos raised millions of dollars by selling shares to hedge funds and venture capitalists, the false claims about the viability of its blood-testing labs ended up being a scheme to defraud. For Ms. Holmes, the settlement means that she will be cut off from raising money for any new venture for a long time. The complaint shows a systemic effort to deceive investors over a number of years, no doubt in a desperate hope that somehow the technology could be made to work. It is unlikely anyone in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street will trust her again. — Peter J. Henning Mr. Kudlow, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, said that Mr. Trump offered him the job as director of the National Economic Council and that he immediately accepted. Mr. Kudlow told The Journal that an announcement could come as early as Thursday. Reaction Mark Hamrick, Bankrate.com’s senior economic analyst: “It remains to be seen whether Kudlow can step into the role of a virtual moderating influence in this administration. Unlike others in this White House, he does have experience in government and the private sector. But unlike television where on-air conflict is sometimes mostly for show, the health of the national and global economy is at stake here.” Ten year’s ago almost to the day, JPMorgan Chase acquired Bear Stearns, a troubled investment bank, for what looked like a steal. But Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s C.E.O., has since said he wouldn’t do a deal like it again, citing the high legal costs that came later. But was buying Bear Stearns as bad a deal as Mr. Dimon suggests? While we don’t have all the numbers necessary for a full accounting, there is much in the public domain that can help answer this question. And this information suggests that, while the Bear Stearns acquisition probably wasn’t as profitable as expected in March 2008, JPMorgan may still have benefited from it — even after taking into account the legal expenses. What caused the legal costs and how big were they? The payouts were made mostly to settle allegations that Wall Street firms had stuffed loans into mortgage-backed bonds that did not meet agreed upon standards. How big were those costs? In his 2015 letter to shareholders, Mr. Dimon said that some 70 percent of JPMorgan’s nearly $19 billion in mortgage-related legal costs were related to Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, the thrift JPMorgan also bought during the crisis. For the sake of argument, let’s assume that 35 percent of that $19 billion stemmed from Bear Stearns’ mortgages. The cost to JPMorgan then would be around $6.7 billion. That’s a lot, but when JPMorgan did the deal, it agreed to terms that gave it a lot of financial protection against nasty surprises like this. JPMorgan paid $1.5 billion for Bear Stearns, far below the $11.8 billion of shareholders’ equity that Bear Stearns reported on its balance sheet at the end of 2007. This wide margin for error would have helped the bank absorb the $6 billion of merger-related costs that executives anticipated in March 2008. Advertisement True, JPMorgan almost certainly ended up marking down Bear Stearns’ riskier assets by more than expected in the months after the deal, when market conditions got even worse. But many of these assets could have recovered in the next few years as the financial system stabilized. After 2008, “principal transactions” at JPMorgan’s investment bank, the business line that included the performance of many of Bear Stearns’ assets, produced over $8 billion of annual revenue, far more than the $4.4 billion that JPMorgan on its own generated in 2007. Let’s also not forget that the Federal Reserve took a large slug of the risk in the deal. The Fed made an extraordinary loan to a special entity that bought some $30 billion of Bear Stearns’ assets. According to Kate Kelly’s book on Bear Stearns’ final days, JPMorgan was reluctant to buy Bear Stearns without assistance from the Fed. JPMorgan did provide a $1.2 billion loan to the Fed’s entity, in theory exposing it to some losses on the assets. But in the end, that loan generated a $665 million gain for JPMorgan in 2012. The Bear Stearns deal also came with some straightforward positives. JPMorgan, for instance, got Bear Stearns’ leading prime brokerage unit, a business that provided brokerage services to hedge funds. That and other Bear Stearns operations were expected to add at least $1 billion a year to JPMorgan earnings, the bank’s executives said at the time. And, of course, JPMorgan scooped up Bear Stearns’ trophy tower in Midtown Manhattan. At the time of the deal, the building, at 383 Madison Ave., had an estimated value of $1.2 billion. According to the estimates of developers in the New York real estate market, the building is now worth at least $1.8 billion. -- Peter Eavis with reporting from Charles V. Bagli.

He took to the internet to find out what had happened to the shares of Experian, a rival credit bureau, after it revealed that hackers had breached its system. At approximately 10:00 a.m. on Monday, August 28, 2017, Ying used a search engine to find information on the internet concerning the September 2015 cybersecurity breach of Experian, another one of the three major credit bureaus, and the impact that breach had on Experian’s stock price.

The White House has made no secret of its concerns about Beijing, and seems to have been motivated by the prospect of Qualcomm losing its lead in 5G. Some now worry that this could be another front in a potential global trade war. Here’s Jason Furman, a senior economic adviser in the Obama White House, talking to the NYT: “If every country in the world conducted policy like that, it would make cross-border investment difficult to the detriment of American and foreign companies,” Mr. Furman said. “Foreign direct investment is an important part of the strength of the U.S. economy.” Of note: Qualcomm spent far more than Broadcom on lobbying. Broadcom officially withdrew its bid this morning. Advertisement What’s next for Qualcomm: The chip maker’s Hail Mary — petitioning the government for a national-security review of Broadcom’s bid — paid off handsomely. But now it has to show investors that it can fix its business. Peter Eavis’s take: National champions have to deliver. Will Qualcomm become less efficient under the government’s protection? If so, U.S. tax payers may feel taken advantage of. Elsewhere in semiconductors: The industry largely ignored a short seller’s report on purported security flaws in AMD chips. (Axios) President Trump announced his metals tariffs to protect American makers of aluminum and steel. But that could put Boeing in the firing line — America’s top exporter, which employs nearly as many people as the U.S. steel and aluminum industries combined.

They are one of our biggest customers now.” And Mr. Trump’s attacks on Chinese metal production are in some ways a relic of past trade battles, as Beijing moves away from basic commodities.

 NEW YORK —  Amazon has taken another step to woo low-income shoppers to its site and away from rival Walmart. The online retailer opened its discounted $5.99-a-month Prime membership on Wednesday to people on Medicaid, giving it an even bigger pool of potential shoppers who may otherwise have been unable to pay the standard fee. Since June, Amazon has offered the same Prime discount to people using food stamps or other government assistance through an Electronic Benefit Transfer card. Adding Medicaid recipients makes Prime, and its expedited shipping for no extra cost, accessible to more people, Amazon said. Industry analysts believe Amazon is maneuvering both to expand its Prime membership numbers, and to go after people whose first shopping destination may be Walmart. Advertisement Nearly 70 million people are enrolled in Medicaid, which provides health coverage to low-income people and those with disabilities. More than 42 million participate in the food stamps program, through what is now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Advertisement Amazon.com Inc. declined to say how many people signed up for Prime under the EBT card expansion, but Aaron Perrine, who oversees the program, says those that did sign up kept the service and were engaged Prime users.  . To apply for the discounted Prime, Medicaid recipients need to take a photo of their Medicaid card and upload it to the site. The $5.99-a-month price compares to the regular $12.99 pay-by-month option and is nearly $30 cheaper than the $99-annual-fee plan. Besides two-day shipping, Medicaid receipts will get Prime's other perks, such as access to Amazon's video and music streaming services. Avi Greengart, an industry analyst at GlobalData, said the discount could be helpful to Medicaid recipients with medical issues who can't make it to the store to buy heavy items, such as laundry detergent, or who can't spend more than $25 on every order to qualify for free shipping. ""They are enabling people who otherwise would be priced out,"" said Greengart. _____ We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.

 STOCKHOLM —  IKEA Group, the world's biggest furniture retailer, will maintain or raise already high levels of investment in coming years as it adapts to fast-changing shopping habits, its new CFO said on Wednesday. In a strategy shift, privately held IKEA, known for its huge out-of-town warehouse stores, is starting to add city-centre showroom formats to entice new generations, while also further developing its online store to stave off competition from internet giants including Amazon. IKEA must adapt if it is to stay ahead of online-only players such as Amazon - which in November launched two furniture brands of its own - as well as Flipkart in India and Germany's Otto and Home24. ""Of course you can see online players such as Amazon and Flipkart growing,"" Juvencio Maeztu told Reuters in his first interview since becoming chief financial officer of IKEA Group last month. Advertisement ""What is more relevant than ever is to be as close as possible to the consumer - it has much more power than before,"" he said. Advertisement That partly means maintaining heavy investment, even if it puts pressure on profits as it did in the financial year through last August. IKEA Group, owner of most IKEA budget furniture stores worldwide, invested 3.1 billion euros in stores, distribution and customer service networks, shopping centres, renewable energy and forestry in its 2016/17 financial year. Maeztu said total annual investments in traditional store expansion, new city-centre formats, digital services, e-commerce warehouses and distribution would be as high or higher in fiscal 2018-2020 as in 2017. ""We will invest in being more accessible,"" he said. ""We will keep investing the same or even more over the next three years,"" he said. INDIA LAUNCH IKEA also says its strategy of surveying households about their everyday frustrations and ambitions, for instance by making home visits, gives it a competitive edge.  . Maeztu hopes to draw on his recent experience as IKEA's manager for India, where in 2012 the Swedish group was the first foreign single-brand retailer to get approval to open stores in the country. It aims to open its first Indian store, in Hyderabad, early this summer. In India, his efforts to get close to the customer included 800 visits to family homes either by himself or members of his team during his time there. ""This is something we will do even more,"" Maeztu said. IKEA, whose founder Ingvar Kamprad died in January at the age of 91, operates through a franchise system. Inter IKEA is the brand owner and franchisor. IKEA Group owns 363 stores in 29 markets out of a total of 413 storeS in 49 markets.

It has flagged more acquisitions or  partnerships could be on the cards. For the new CFO, that strategy shift spells a new way for the company to keep a lid on costs, a necessity as the market transforms. ""TaskRabbit is an example of partnership in order to really keep prices down at the same time as we are offering the best of IKEA,"" Maeztu said. ""We are exploring other partnerships, but we don't have anything specific (to communicate) now,"" he said.

 FRANKFURT —  Broadcaster RTL Group will speed up a push into exclusive programming, offering locally focused video-on-demand services in its European markets in response to platforms like Netflix and Amazon. RTL, controlled by German publisher Bertelsmann, has weathered weak TV advertising demand better than rivals but is nonetheless accelerating a 'total video' strategy that seeks to address changing viewing habits. ""We are seeing the challenging TV markets in a macroeconomic development which is very prosperous – this is a very clear signal to us to accelerate our strategic execution,"" CEO Bert Habets told Reuters in an interview. RTL earlier reported solid 2017 results, with revenues up 2.2 percent to 6.37 billion euros (5.71 billion pounds). Earnings before interest, taxation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose by 3.8 percent to 1.46 billion euros, broadly in line with forecasts. Advertisement RTL, whose core markets are Germany, France and the Benelux countries, forecast revenue growth of between 2.5 percent and 5 percent this year. Core earnings would remain broadly unchanged, adjusting for a one-off gain from property sales last year. Advertisement RTL shares were 2 percent lower, amid broadly weaker sentiment towards the media sector after U.S. consumer products giant Procter & Gamble said it would cut spending on ad agencies. LOCAL VS GLOBAL The rise of the global platforms, and U.S. entertainment group Comcast's bid for Britain's Sky, threaten to marginalise European broadcasters that still rely on advertising for the bulk of their revenues. But, rather than take a leaf out of their book, RTL wants to focus on national audiences by offering more original programming, including via subscription services delivered as and when viewers want to watch. It plans new video-on-demand services in Belgium, Hungary and Croatia, all based on its existing French 6play platform.  . ""We are very confident to continue developing and investing in these on-demand services in all countries where we have a strong family of channels,"" said Habets, who recently became sole CEO at RTL. RTL has a strong background in game-show formats, but has backed production arm Fremantle Media's move into producing scripted television dramas. That has attracted the interest of the mega-platforms: Amazon recently commissioned Deutschland 86, the follow-up to an espionage serial that first aired on RTL in Germany. There's still mileage in the ad-driven TV model, said Habets, pointing to the outperformance of RTL's core franchises in Germany and France last year. Of total revenues, advertising still accounts for 47.5 percent, less that its main competitors. Advertisement The company wants to increase the share of digital revenues as a percentage of the total to 15 percent by 2020 from 13 percent last year. ""The power of linear TV will continue to be very strong, especially in the European markets, where fragmentation is ongoing, but less severe than in other continents of the world,"" said Habets. RTL said it would propose a final dividend of 3 euros per share, on top of an interim dividend of 1 euro paid last September, representing a dividend yield of 5.9 percent to its shareholders.

It has also closed poorly performing stores. Advertisement At its 150 remodeled Hollister locations, storefronts are lighter and more open, with lower sight lines so sales associates can see shoppers better. New Abercrombie & Fitch prototypes have no doors at mall locations to be more inviting, have bigger and brighter fitting rooms, and an intercom system so shoppers can request help.

Last year, it launched its first TV commercial for the A&F brand in more than a decade.  . A&F's results Wednesday showed the first quarterly sales gain at established stores in five years at its preppy namesake brand. Sales at stores open at least a year, a key revenue metric for retailers, climbed 9 percent overall. That metric rose 11 percent at Hollister and 5 percent at Abercrombie. That's the first such increase for the Abercrombie brand since the second quarter of 2011, says Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, a retail research firm. Online sales grew at least 10 percent and accounted for 34 percent of total sales, up from 31 percent a year ago. Horowitz noted that 70 percent of online traffic comes from mobile devices. For the quarter, the New Albany, Ohio-based company earned $74.2 million, or $1.05 per share, up from $48.8 million, or 71 cents per share, a year earlier.

T2,7-Mar-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin MARCH 7, 2018
 Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • How foreign is Broadcom? • The markets are worried that free trade has no voice at the White House. • The E.U. formally announced its plan for any Trump tariffs. • Chuck Rosenberg, a former senior official at the Justice Department, is going to Crowell & Moring. Want this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here. As the Trump administration weighs whether to block the chip maker’s $117 billion takeover bid for Qualcomm, a central issue is how much of a threat the deal is to national security. In an effort to assuage concerns, Broadcom pledged Wednesday to increase research spending on 5G wireless tech and to create a $1.5 billion fund to invest in training engineering talent in the United States to help allay those concerns. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, has jurisdiction over the transaction because Broadcom is currently incorporated in Singapore, where the company has been legally headquartered since 2005. But the company is preparing to move its corporate base to the United States, in part to avoid being considered a foreign acquirer. Advertisement Beyond Broadcom’s legal domicile, though, is it a substantially foreign company? Let’s take a look at a number of factors. Advertisement Sales First, a caveat: Both Broadcom and Qualcomm categorize where their revenue based on the location to which the chips that go in the smartphones and other devices are delivered. As Qualcomm puts it:  “China revenues could include revenues related to shipments of integrated circuits to a company that is headquartered in South Korea but that manufactures devices in China, which devices are then sold to consumers in Europe and/or the United States.” According to Broadcom’s most recent annual report, roughly 7 percent of its $17.6 billion in net revenue comes from the United States. The single biggest market for the company is China, which accounted for roughly 54 percent of its net revenue. “Other” markets made up nearly 38 percent. As a point of comparison, 2 percent of Qualcomm’s revenues come from the United States. Some 65 percent of its revenue comes from China, including Hong Kong, according to its most recent annual report. Employees Roughly 55 percent of Broadcom’s employees are based in North America, according to the annual report. About 38 percent are in Asia, and the remainder work in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. About 52 percent of Qualcomm’s employees are based in the United States. Broadcom also said that about 62 percent of the square footage of its properties, both owned and leased, are in the United States. By contrast, Qualcomm has roughly 56 percent of its owned and leased facilities in the United States. Corporate governance The vast majority of Broadcom’s board are American citizens who live in the United States. That includes Jim Diller, its chairman; Henry Samueli, the founder of the original Broadcom; and Ken Hao, the Silver Lake partner who has backed Broadcom for years. Hock Tan, the company’s C.E.O., immigrated to the United States to attend M.I.T. and then Harvard Business School and lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1990. Broadcom does have one Singaporean director, Check Low, to comply with Singapore’s corporate rules. Advertisement Ownership The two companies share 11 of their top 20 shareholders, including big index fund managers like BlackRock and Vanguard. — Michael de la Merced President Trump’s top economic adviser finally announced he would leave, in a sign that the nationalists have won the White House debate on tariffs. The news prompted Tom Nides, Morgan Stanley’s vice chairman, to utter aloud, “Oh, that’s a problem.” More on Mr. Cohn’s decision from Kate Kelly and Maggie Haberman of the NYT, who broke the news yesterday: It leaves Mr. Trump surrounded primarily by advisers with strong protectionist views who advocate the types of aggressive trade measures, like tariffs, that Mr. Trump campaigned on but that Mr. Cohn fought inside the White House. Mr. Cohn was viewed by Republican lawmakers as the steady hand who could prevent Mr. Trump from engaging in activities that could trigger a trade war. Potential replacements, according to Axios: Peter Navarro, the trade adviser who pushed for the tariffs; Kevin Warsh, the former Fed governor; Shahira Knight, a deputy of Mr. Cohn’s; and the pro-free-trade economist Larry Kudlow. But Axios says that there’s no official succession plan, and that other members of the National Economic Council will likely leave (We can rule out Austan Goolsbee.) The timing: CNBC notes that Mr. Cohn’s announcement came hours after Mr. Trump said that “everyone wants to work in the White House.” It also came after Mr. Trump tweeted, “There is no Chaos, only great Energy!” Peter Eavis’s take: Even if there is no plunge, now is a moment for investors to make up their minds about populism. Critics’ corner: The WSJ editorial board said Mr. Cohn’s departure was “a significant blow” to Mr. Trump’s presidency. The NYT editorial board said Mr. Cohn had done “an awful job,” which still probably represented “the high-water mark for economic thinking” for this White House. And his former boss, Lloyd Blankfein, said he had served his country “in a first class way.” The Federal Reserve has helped support the economy when a big event – fears for the survival of the euro, fiscal standoffs in Congress, oil price declines — threatens to dampen growth. But will the Fed have the same leeway to stimulate the economy if rising trade tensions start to weigh on the growth prospects of the United States? Advertisement Maybe not. The Fed had ample room to keep its policy loose when inflation was dormant for years after the financial crisis. But now that inflation seems to be waking up, the Fed might not have the same flexibility. Indeed, amid the current trade tumult, investors still seem to believe that inflation is moving higher. This can be seen in a closely watched bond market indicator flagged this morning by Lisa Abramowicz of Bloomberg. 
            As fears of a trade war heat up, U.S. inflation expectations over the next five years have risen to the highest since 2013, as per 5-year forward breakeven contracts. pic.twitter.com/ZgXyYqxh6c  One outcome: The concerns about a trade war may end up weighing on growth and causing the inflationary pressures to abate. That would give the Fed more room to maneuver, perhaps allowing it to raise interest rates more slowly. But it could get messy. Trade tariffs, applied broadly, could push up the prices of many goods at a time when the Fed has to grapple with the enormous fiscal stimulus that Congress just enacted. - Peter Eavis Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard became the latest policymaker to express confidence that inflation would hit the Fed’s target of 2 percent this year. “Mounting tailwinds at a time of full employment and above-trend growth tip the balance of considerations in my view. With greater confidence in achieving the inflation target, continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate.” What are those tailwinds? “The most notable tailwind is the shift in America’s fiscal policy stance from restraint to substantial stimulus in an economy close to full employment.” Ms. Brainard’s comments are notable because she had previously argued vocally for caution in tightening monetary policy. Major stocks indexes in the United States are down a bit. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 are both off just over 0.5 percent. Futures fell more than 1 percent in the hours after the news broke. Despite the muted response, a number of analysts are warning that investors need to prepare for the possibility that more protectionist/populist policies are on the way. Here’s a look at some reactions: Joe Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM US, wrote:  “The resignation of Gary Cohen from his position at the White House will likely have no to little impact on policymaking out of the West Wing or the bureaucracy. His likely replacement be it Peter Navarro or Larry Kudlow will still be subject to the whims of the occupant of the oval office and a prisoner of the internal inconsistencies of the Trump economic agenda: that it could debt finance a $1.5 trillion dollar tax cut (with a $750 billion fudge factor) and then throw an additional $320 billion in kerosene on top of the debt fueled flames without stoking rising inflation and higher interest rates that are almost certain to follow in its wake. No economic advisor, whatever their academic or professional background will be able to liberate the economy from such internal inconsistencies given the whim like policy making apparatus that exists inside a chaotic White House.” Brian Gardner and Michael Michaud, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote:  “Regardless of whether Mr. Cohn’s replacement comes from the mainstream or is an economic nationalist, investors need to realize that President Trump’s populist rhetoric on trade is real and that protectionist trade policies are more likely than not. To date, investors have been assuaged that Mr. Cohn was the “adult in the room” in an unorthodox and chaotic White House and for most economic and regulatory policy that was the case. However, we think trade policy is different and investors need to understand that the assumptions about a liberal and open global trade framework are being shredded and that the sanctions on steel and aluminum may represent a new paradigm regarding global trade.” What does that mean? The analysts said they think the United States is more likely than not to withdraw from Nafta. Charlie McElligott at Nomura Securities wrote:  “It still feels that collective investor mentality views this as little-more than a political ploy to galvanize Trump’s core constituency into mid-term elections, a game-theory standoff to draw-out trade concessions from China.” But he adds: “It does “pull forward” risk of the “Bad Trump” scenario which that market had largely “priced-out” into the “now.” Between Feb. 12 and Feb. 22, the billionaire investor sold about $31 million of the crane maker's stock. Advertisement To some, that seemed like good timing. Since the day before he started selling, the stock is down 20 percent. The catalyst? The Trump administration’s plans to slap tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Manitowoc stock fell 4.8 percent on Feb. 16 when Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross unveiled a report calling for tariffs on imported steel. The company’s shares then dropped 6 percent Thursday when President Trump announced his plan. On Wednesday, Mr. Icahn said he had no knowledge of the Trump administration’s plans when he moved to reduce his holding. In a statement on his website, Mr. Icahn said: “We don’t generally comment on rumors, but the recent media speculation regarding our sale of Manitowoc stock calls for a response. We state for the record: Any suggestion that we had prior knowledge of the Trump administration’s announcement of new tariffs on steel imports is categorically untrue. We reduced our position in Manitowoc for legitimate investment reasons having nothing to do with that announcement.” The political bloc formally announced its plan to counterattack, including taxing American goods like Harley-Davidsons and bourbon and filing a challenge with the World Trade Organization. Meanwhile, allies continued to fret. South Korea worries that tariffs will complicate its efforts to denuclearize the North. Christine Lagarde of the I.M.F. warned of the perils of a trade war. And fellow Republicans in Washington continued to lobby the White House. The aluminum industry doesn’t want tariffs either In a letter to the White House yesterday, the Aluminum Association (which represents both U.S. and foreign suppliers) said that the move would be a bad idea. Complaints can be heard around the sector. The C.E.O. of Novelis, a big aluminum producer, criticized Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for saying predictions of price increases were “hysteria.” And DowDuPont said it might now build plants in Canada or Argentina rather than the U.S. Bayer said it is in exclusive talks with BASF about the sale of its entire vegetable seeds business as the German chemicals multinational, seeks to win approval for its $56 billion deal for Monsanto from European regulators. European antitrust regulators opened an in-depth investigation into Bayer’s planned acquisition of Monsanto, its American agribusiness rival, in August. European competition authorities are expected to wrap up their inquiry by early next month. The proposed combination is the latest in a series of mergers in the rapidly consolidating seed and agrochemical sector. Advertisement Bayer previously agreed to sell selected businesses with its Crop Sciences unit to BASF for 5.9 billion euros, or about $7.3 billion at current exchange rates, in October. Both deals, if one were to be reached on the vegetable seeds business, would be subject to the Monsanto transaction closing. — Chad Bray Mr. Rosenberg had a long career in government: twice U.S. attorney, he’s been a longtime senior official at the Justice Department (including as chief of staff to James Comey) and acting head of the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. .

So important is 5G that Cfius disclosed serious national security concerns about Broadcom buying Qualcomm. Advertisement More from Cecilia Kang and Alan Rappeport of the NYT: “It is the new paradigm,” said Paul Triolo, head of global technology policy at Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consulting company. “That implies technologies with 5G, artificial intelligence, biotech and automation are now considered more sensitive and part of a national innovation base that needs to be protected.” As Michael points out, however, much of Cfius’s letter to the two companies focused on how Broadcom could manage Qualcomm if it took over. Its “private equity” cost-cutting could lead to Qualcomm reducing investment in R. & D. and ceding its 5G lead to Huawei of China, according to the letter. Broadcom said this morning that it was committed to advancing 5G and that it is an American company in everything but legal headquarters.

 SAN FRANCISCO —  One of Amazon.com Inc's longtime executives is leaving the company to join Airbnb Inc, filling a key position as the home-renting business focuses on growth in Latin America and Asia. Greg Greeley, who was vice president of Amazon Prime and is credited with building the delivery service into one of the    e-commerce industry's most successful programs, with an estimated 90 million members in the United States, is joining Airbnb, it said on Tuesday. In his new role, as president of homes, Greeley will oversee the daily operations and strategy of Airbnb's core home-renting business. Airbnb has four business units, and the homes unit was the only one without a permanent boss. Chief Executive Brian Chesky had been filling in temporarily. The home-renting business, which is profitable, includes more than 4.5 million listings in 81,000 cities. Advertisement Greeley starts this month at Airbnb's San Francisco headquarters. Most recently, Greeley was tasked with making Prime the loyalty programme of Whole Foods Market, the upscale grocer that Amazon acquired last year. It was not clear how his departure from Amazon might affect the Whole Foods integration, if at all. Advertisement ""We thank Greg for his contributions to Amazon and wish him the best in his new role,"" an Amazon spokesperson said. In his more than 18 years at Amazon, Greeley helped lead the company's international expansion, running European operations and opening offices in India and Brazil.  . That experience may bode well for Airbnb's ambitions in emerging markets. Faced with regulatory restrictions in the United States and Europe that have limited home-renting, Airbnb has increasingly turned to Latin America and Asia, markets Chesky has said will more than make up for revenue losses in more regulated cities. About 81 percent of Airbnb's business is outside of North America, according to the company. While Greeley was living in Europe and working for Amazon, travel aggregator site Booking.com tried to hire him to be CEO, according to a source with knowledge of the matter. He declined. Greeley helped create and grow Amazon's Prime business, which launched in 2005. While Airbnb does not have a loyalty programme near the scale of Prime, it has similar aspirations. Last month the company announced new perks and rewards for home renters and hosts in a bid to encourage more loyalty and spending among its top users. Airbnb is still recruiting for two top executive positions -- chief marketing officer and chief financial officer.

 NEW YORK —  Target is increasing the minimum hourly pay to $12 starting this spring, the second increase in a matter of months, while accelerating its reinvention plan to make the discounter more competitive in the age of Amazon. The discounter's moves, announced at its annual investor meeting in Minneapolis, where the company is based, come as its ambitious plan to make itself over is driving more people to its stores and its website. But the cost of such a massive overhaul, along with its pay increases, squeezed its fourth-quarter profits, and it took some shine off overall strong quarterly sales. The company also offered a muted profit outlook. In fact, shares were trading lower Tuesday on the news of muted profits before the announcement of the pay hike. And investors punished the stock further, sending shares down nearly 5 percent. Last fall, Target increased its hourly wage to $11 from $10. Brian Cornell, CEO of Target, told analysts Tuesday the company saw a better applicant pool and a 60 percent spike in the number of applicants in the days after the announcement. Cornell reiterated Tuesday its promise to increase the minimum pay to $15 by the end of 2020. Advertisement Target also announced other initiatives to help it speed up deliveries and make shopping in its stores easier. The company is rolling out free, two-day shipping for hundreds of thousands of items on Target.com. Except for holders of its branded credit card, shoppers previously needed to spend at least $35 to get free shipping. And its same-day delivery service, which was tested New York City, is being rolled out to key cities in the U.S. such as Boston and Chicago. Target, which was testing curbside pickup at 50 stores, said it also plans to expand to 1,000 locations nationwide. Advertisement ""2017 was a year of significant progress,"" Cornell said. ""2018 is all about acceleration."" As it races to modernize, Target's profit margins are under significant pressure. The bottom lines of traditional retailers are getting bruised trying to hold Amazon.com at bay. Late last month, Walmart reported weak fourth-quarter profits as it stumbled with e-commerce sales during the crucial holiday season. Where investors punished Walmart by selling off shares, the reaction on Tuesday to Target was more subdued, suggesting that the traditionally irascible Wall Street may be giving the retailer what it needs most: more time to win over consumers. Some industry analysts seemed exasperated with the fickleness of Wall Street in what they believe is a turnaround story. ""While we understand the concern over increasing costs, we are critical of voices that see this as a weakness,"" wrote Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData. ""We take the contrary view: if it is to grow, Target needs to invest — including in customer service, which affects wages. The alternative, which is to restrict or throttle investment, may deliver more profit in the short term, but it will be to the detriment of long-term performance.""  . But traditional retailers face a moving target in Amazon.com. Amazon has created fierce loyalty among shoppers who spend $99 for a membership that comes with free shipping, as well as streaming movies and music. Its acquisition of Whole Foods Market last year has raised the stakes for Target and Walmart, which also sell groceries. Amazon just introduced two-hour Whole Foods delivery for Prime members. Target pledged last year to invest more than $7 billion in modernization efforts over the next three years. That includes remodeling old stores, opening small locations in cities and college towns and faster online delivery. Late last year, the company said it was accelerating plans to remodel more than half of its 1,800 stores by 2020. Target earned $1.1 billion, or $2.02 per share, in the fourth quarter, compared with $817 million, or $1.45 per share, a year earlier. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were $1.37 per share, which is 2 cents short of analyst projections, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue rose 10 percent to $22.77 billion, edging out expectations for $22.46 billion. Target reported a 3.6 percent increase in revenue at stores opened at least a year. That beat estimates of a 3.1 percent gain, according to FactSet. Same-store sales, a crucial barometer in the industry, rose more than 4 percent in January, suggesting that Target's transformation is sustainable. Advertisement Customer traffic rose 3.2 percent and online sales jumped 29 percent in the fourth quarter. The company logged healthy sales growth in all five of its merchandising areas, including fashion and home furnishings. Target expects its per-share earnings this quarter to range from $1.25 to $1.45. Analysts expect $1.40. Full-year earnings are projected in the range of $5.15 to $5.45 per share, versus Wall Street expectations for $5.21. Shares of Target Corp. fell 4.7 percent, or $3.58 in early afternoon trading, to $71.56. _____ Elements of the story were generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

 FRANKFURT/BERLIN —  German software giant SAP on Tuesday said operating margins hit bottom last year and will begin to arc up this year and rise further through 2020 and beyond, as profitability improves in its internet-based cloud business. Speaking to investors in New York, SAP executives also detailed moves to make it easier for customers to run SAP business planning tools via low-cost Amazon, Google or Microsoft cloud servers or in SAP's own datacenters, allowing it to pare back its capital spending. Chief Financial Officer Luka Mucic told the company's annual capital markets day event that easing up on heavy investments to switch customers to cloud-based software would help margins rise to 29.8 percent in 2018 and reach around 30.7 percent by 2020, with further improvements into the next decade. SAP had reported margins troughing at 28.9 percent in 2017. Board member and products chief Bernd Leukert said the company would let customers interchangeably run their software on SAP datacenters or on public cloud services. The executives' comments were monitored by Reuters via webcast. Advertisement SAP plans to shut down 18 of its 45 datacenters by the end of 2019, as more customers switch to public cloud services, a faster pace than the 10 datacenters it closed in the last two to three years. Advertisement Leukert also said that consolidating a string of cloud software acquisitions running on separate platforms, each separately maintained, onto a single, common platform would be completed by the end of 2018, further shaving costs.  . He said SAP had elected to harmonise its own company-run datacenters by standardising Google as its preferred ""go-to"" infrastructure. ""There is no difference any more running in Google or on SAP infrastructure,"" he said. Nonetheless, Leukert said SAP was working with all major public cloud providers and had no plans to compete with them. ""Our cloud solutions run on the major public cloud providers,"" he said.

 PARIS —  Retailer Carrefour is hoping blockchain-based technology will improve checks on the standards of its food products, as it prepares a major overhaul to tackle competition from Amazon, Leclerc and others. Carrefour is among several leading companies tapping into the growing use of blockchain in order to track where products come from, as consumers increasingly look to ensure that products meet standards regarding ethics and general safety. Carrefour, Europe's largest retailer, said on Tuesday that the use of blockchain would enable shoppers in France to trace where certain food products are sourced, and added it was extending its use of such technology in this capacity. Blockchain, which first emerged as the system underpinning the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, is a shared record of data kept by a network of computers, rather than a trusted third party. Advertisement Last year, Nestle, Unilever, Tyson Foods and other large food and retail companies joined an IBM project to explore how blockchain technology can help track food supply chains and improve safety. Advertisement BMW and a London-based start-up company also said this week they would use blockchain to prove batteries for its electric vehicles only contain clean cobalt. Carrefour will extend the use of blockchain to honey, eggs, cheese, milk, oranges, tomatoes, salmon and hamburgers by end-2018. It currently uses the blockchain programme to trace the production of free-range chicken in the Auvergne region in central France. Consumers can use a smartphone to scan a code on the package to obtain information at each stage of production, including where and how the chickens were raised and what they were fed as well as where the meat was processed, added the French company.  . Carrefour is also currently conducting blockchain tests to improve tracing the source of food products in China and could expand it to other countries. Alexandre Bompard, who took over as Carrefour's CEO in July, unveiled in January a five-year plan to boost profits and sales. The plan entails overhauling Carrefour's French hypermarkets and expanding online operations, with a pledge to invest 2.8 billion euros (£2.5 billion) in digital commerce by 2022. The group, which has struggled for years to become less reliant on its French hypermarkets, has promised to revamp its range of food, as customers demand healthier products. Carrefour is targeting 5 billion euros in organic food sales by 2022, compared to 1 billion euros generated at present.

ECONOMIC SCENE
MARCH 6, 2018
 Should Facebook pay us for our puppy pictures? Of course, the idea sounds crazy. Posting puppies on Facebook is not a chore. We love it: Facebook’s 1.4 billion daily users spend the better part of an hour on it every day. It’s amazing that we don’t have to pay for it. And yet the idea is gaining momentum in Silicon Valley and beyond: Facebook and the other technological Goliaths offering free online services — from which they harvest data from and about their users — should pay for every nugget of information they reap. The spring break pictures on Instagram, the YouTube video explaining Minecraft tactics, the internet searches and the Amazon purchases, even your speed following Waze on the way to spend Thanksgiving with your in-laws — this data is valuable. It will become more valuable, potentially much more so, in the not-too-distant future. Getting companies to pay transparently for the information will not just provide a better deal for the users whose data is scooped up as they go about their online lives. It will also improve the quality of the data on which the information economy is being built. And it could undermine the data titans’ stranglehold on technology’s future, breathing fresh air into an economy losing its vitality. Advertisement The idea has been around for a bit. Jaron Lanier, the tech philosopher and virtual-reality pioneer who now works for Microsoft Research, proposed it in his 2013 book, “Who Owns the Future?,” as a needed corrective to an online economy mostly financed by advertisers’ covert manipulation of users’ consumer choices. It is being picked up in “Radical Markets,” a book due out shortly from Eric A. Posner of the University of Chicago Law School and E. Glen Weyl, principal researcher at Microsoft. And it is playing into European efforts to collect tax revenue from American internet giants. In a report obtained last month by Politico, the European Commission proposes to impose a tax on the revenue of digital companies based on their users’ location, on the grounds that “a significant part of the value of a business is created where the users are based and data is collected and processed.” Users’ data is a valuable commodity. Facebook offers advertisers precisely targeted audiences based on user profiles. YouTube, too, uses users’ preferences to tailor its feed. Still, this pales in comparison with how valuable data is about to become, as the footprint of artificial intelligence extends across the economy. Data is the crucial ingredient of the A.I. revolution. Training systems to perform even relatively straightforward tasks like voice translation, voice transcription or image recognition requires vast amounts of data — like tagged photos, to identify their content, or recordings with transcriptions. Advertisement “Among leading A.I. teams, many can likely replicate others’ software in, at most, one to two years,” notes the technologist Andrew Ng. “But it is exceedingly difficult to get access to someone else’s data. Thus data, rather than software, is the defensible barrier for many businesses.” We may think we get a fair deal, offering our data as the price of sharing puppy pictures. By other metrics, we are being victimized: In the largest technology companies, the share of income going to labor is only about 5 to 15 percent, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl write. That’s way below Walmart’s 80 percent. Consumer data amounts to work they get free. “If these A.I.-driven companies represent the future of broader parts of the economy,” they argue, “without something basic changing in their business model, we may be headed for a world where labor’s share falls dramatically from its current roughly 70 percent to something closer to 20 to 30 percent.”  . As Mr. Lanier, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl point out, it is ironic that humans are providing free data to train the artificial-intelligence systems to replace workers across the economy. Commentators from both left and right fret over how ordinary people will put food on the table once robots take all the jobs. Perhaps a universal basic income, funded by taxes, is the answer? How about paying people for the data they produced to train the robots? If A.I. accounted for 10 percent of the economy and the big-data companies paid two-thirds of their income for data — the same as labor’s share of income across the economy — the share of income going to “workers” would rise drastically. By Mr. Weyl and Mr. Posner’s reckoning, the median household of four would gain $20,000 a year. A critical consideration is that if people were paid for their data, its quality and value would increase. Facebook could directly ask users to tag the puppy pictures to train the machines. It could ask translators to upload their translations. Facebook and Google could demand quality information if the value of the transaction were more transparent. Unwilling to enter in a direct quid pro quo with their users, the data titans must make do with whatever their users submit. The transition would not be painless. We would need to figure out systems to put value on data. Your puppy pictures might turn out to be worthless, but that college translation from Serbo-Croatian could be valuable. Barred from free data, YouTube and Facebook might charge a user fee for their service — like Netflix. Alternatively, they might make their money from training A.I. systems and pay some royalty stream to the many people whose data helped train them. But whatever the cost, the transformation seems worthwhile. Notably, it could help resolve one of the most relevant questions coming into focus in this new technological age: Who will control the data? Today, the dominant data harvesters in the business are Google and Facebook, with Amazon, Apple and Microsoft some way behind. Their dominance cannot really be challenged: Could you think of a rival search engine? Could another social network replace the one all your friends are on? This dominance might matter less if companies had to pay for their users’ data. Advertisement Google and Facebook and Amazon would not be able to extend the network effects that cemented their place at the top of the technology ecosystem to the world of A.I. Everybody wants to be on Facebook because everybody’s friends are on Facebook. But this dominance could be eroded if rivals made direct offers of money for data. Companies with different business models might join the fray. “This is an opportunity for other companies to enter and say look, we will pay you for this data,” Mr. Posner said. “All this is so new that ordinary people haven’t figured out how manipulated they are by these companies.” The big question, of course, is how we get there from here. My guess is that it would be naïve to expect Google and Facebook to start paying for user data of their own accord, even if that improved the quality of the information. Could policymakers step in, somewhat the way the European Commission did, demanding that technology companies compute the value of consumer data? In any event, there is probably a better deal out there, in your future, than giving Facebook free puppy pictures.

T1,6-Mar-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin MARCH 6, 2018
 Good Tuesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Gary Cohn is exiting the White House. • Why Cfius thinks Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm is a national security matter • A top aluminum lobbying group argues against tariffs • Should mutual funds become activists on guns? • Could the Trump tariffs be weakened? Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Will the gains investors have made under President Trump now walk out the door, too? Mr. Cohn was an influential figure in the White House. As the president’s top economic adviser, he opposed policies, like the tariffs announced last week, that go against the prevailing global economic order. Now that Mr. Cohn is leaving, investors may fear that Mr. Trump and others in his administration will step up their assault on globalism, stoking the chances of a trade war and other tensions that damage the real economy. Advertisement Mr. Cohn has telegraphed his unhappiness with some of President Trump’s policies, so his departure may not come as a surprise to investors. They also may believe that the chaos in the White House will limit the administration’s ability to deliver on policies investors don’t like. And of course, investors may hope that Mr. Trump, unwilling to see the stock market’s gains unwind, stays his hand. It’s even possible that Mr. Trump will keep talking to Mr. Cohn after he leaves, or that he will replace Mr. Cohn with someone with similar views, like Larry Kudlow. Advertisement Still, the Dow Jones industrial average may open sharply down on Wednesday morning. The markets were rattled in August when there were rumors that Mr. Cohn might resign. And futures markets on Tuesday evening pointed to a lower open. But even if there is no plunge, now is a moment for investors to make up their minds about populism. For two years, the markets have consistently shrugged off everything from Britain’s departure from the European Union to the election of Mr. Trump to the rise of non-mainstream parties in Europe. Investors could look the other way because global growth was picking up, and Mr. Trump was introducing pro-business policies like tax cuts and deregulation. But investors and populists are entwined in a way that is not obvious. Right now, economies are suffering from what could be called “Toxic Goldilocks Syndrome.” The stimulus of central banks has delivered moderate economic growth and steady returns for investors that keep them happy. At the same time, though, the central bank’s policies have struggled to solve deeper problems like income inequality and low labor market participation. As these persist, they provide fuel for populist candidates. What could change now? With Mr. Cohn leaving, one of Mr. Trump’s policies may end up causing real economic damage. That’s a concern of investors, at least. But then much depends on how the Federal Reserve responds. If, say, Mr. Trump’s tariffs dampened growth this year, the Fed might choose to raise interest rates once, rather than three times, in effect helping investors and the White House. But there is a much brighter scenario. Despite the deeper economic problems and the tumult over trade, growth picks up to a level that causes a real bump in wages this year, and Mr. Trump decides to bask in that success, rather than aiming a wrecking ball at the international economic order. But who’s around now to make that argument? — Peter Eavis Cfius said that Broadcom’s proposed deal to acquire rival chip maker Qualcomm could pose a national security risk and called for a full investigation into the hostile bid, according to a letter from a United States Treasury official. During the time between Qualcomm’s unilateral filing and Treasury’s agency filing, Cfius has been communicating with both parties to obtain additional information to inform its decision on the appropriate path forward in regards to this matter. It was during this time, and as a result of these communications and additional information, that Cfius has come to believe that Broadcom’s successful hostile takeover attempt of Qualcomm, including the related stock purchase, proxy contest for the election of six directors to Qualcomm’s Board as proposed and selected by Broadcom, Proposed Agreement and Plan of Merger, and any potential merger between Broadcom and Qualcomm, could pose a risk to the national security of the United States. The letter goes on to say: Cfius has identified potential national security concerns that warrant a full investigation of the proposed transaction. Articulation of the potential national security concerns, in significant part, is classified. The move complicates an already contentious deal, increasing the likelihood that Broadcom will end its pursuit of Qualcomm. Such investigations are often death knells for corporate deals. Advertisement Cfius said that the potential risk was related to Broadcom’s relationships with foreign entities. A spokesman for Broadcom told DealBook in a statement, “we are fully cooperating with Cfius.” Michael’s take Though Cfius stressed the importance of protecting national security, relatively little of the letter focused on explaining traditional matters of national security. Though the document mentioned Broadcom’s “relationships with third party foreign entities,” it does not go into detail about those ties. The letter does note that descriptions of national security concerns are largely classified. But it makes no mention of Qualcomm’s publicly disclosed partnerships with Huawei, the Chinese rival long considered closely tied to Beijing, on the 5G standard, either. What Cfius appears capable of describing publicly is concern about how Broadcom might manage Qualcomm after a successful takeover. The government panel describes Broadcom’s potential approach as akin to “private equity,” referring to the company’s well-known penchant for cutting costs to help drive profits. To the government, that could pose dangers for Qualcomm’s edge in advancing 5G technology. The chip maker is considered, along with Huawei, to be one of the two leading developers of the superfast wireless standard, and any potential disruption to its business could mean ceding an important advantage to the Chinese, Cfius writes. “While the United States remains dominant in the standards-setting space currently, China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover. Given well-known U.S. national security concerns about Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies, a shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States.” Cfius’s letter also notes that Qualcomm supplies the United States government with important products, and consults on cybersecurity matters relating to 5G and the internet of things. Any disruption of that work, the panel writes, “could have a detrimental impact on national security.” Another take from a friend of DealBook Here are tweets by Steven Davidoff Solomon, long known as our colleague the Deal Professor: 
            Resending as thread: The letter from CFIUS on Broadcm and Qualcomm is remarkable and a must read. One of the security risks cited is the operation of Q in a private equity manner, with underinvestment in R&D! Of course, Huawei and China make an appearance: https://t.co/KlkZXMAOdj  
            The ramifications of a broad-based investment approach by CFIUS to approval of deals has wide-spread ramifications. With the tariffs and CFIUS we are entering into a realpolitik of American trade.         
            This realpolitik acknowledges that China uses its antitrust policy to obtain technology from US companies, China and many other countries prohibit U.S. investment in certain industries and the state apparatus benefits domestic companies. The U.S. is merely playing catch-up.         — Michael de la Merced President Trump said that he is thinking of putting tariffs on imported aluminum and steel to protect the domestic metal industries. But in a letter to the White House today, the Aluminum Association said that the move would be a bad idea. From the group’s letter, signed by its C.E.O., Heidi Brock: We fear that the proposed tariff may do more harm than good, hurting rather than helping the 97 percent of aluminum industry jobs in mid-and-downstream production processes. In the letter, the association says that more narrowly targeted tariffs on Chinese production — which would be more akin to what previous administrations have done — and exemptions for trading partners like Canada and the E.U. would be better. Advertisement Worth noting:  The association’s website says that it represents both U.S. and foreign suppliers. — Michael de la Merced Policy flyaround • Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tells lawmakers: “We are not looking to get into trade wars.” (Bloomberg) • Harley-Davidson is bracing for a one-two punch: President Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum and threats of retaliation from Europe.

BlackBerry argues that Facebook and its Whatsapp and Instagram apps copied technology and features from BlackBerry Messenger, Reuters reports. BlackBerry said in a filing with a Los Angeles federal court. “Defendants created mobile messaging applications that co-opt BlackBerry’s innovations, using a number of the innovative security, user interface, and functionality enhancing features.” Facebook Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal told Reuters: “BlackBerry’s suit sadly reflects the current state of its messaging business. Having abandoned its efforts to innovate, Blackberry is now looking to tax the innovation of others.” “BlackBerry is trying to persuade other companies to pay licensing royalties to use its trove of more than 40,000 global patents on technology including operating systems, networking infrastructure, acoustics, messaging, automotive subsystems, cybersecurity and wireless communications,” Reuters reports. Greg Greeley, an executive at Amazon, is joining Airbnb as president of Homes. He will oversee the company’s core business, including its newly launched Airbnb Plus and Airbnb Collections programs. “Words can’t express how excited I am to join the Airbnb team,” Mr. Greeley said. “I’ve used Airbnb for years, and the chance to work here and expand the positive impact its community is having around the world is a once in a lifetime opportunity.” Advertisement Mr. Greeley has spent the past 18 years at Amazon. Most recently, he led Amazon Prime. Before that, he oversaw the launch of businesses in India and Brazil for the e-commerce giant and managed its European consumer businesses. Context Airbnb has been reorganizing and building out its executive ranks. Last month, Belinda Johnson, the home-rental company’s chief business affairs and legal officer, was named the chief operating officer, and Laurence Tosi, Airbnb’s chief financial officer, left the company to focus on his investment fund. Every expert that Michael and our colleagues spoke to yesterday acknowledged that the national security panel’s review of Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm was extraordinary. (One other time Cfius was involved in a contested situation, recalled by Reuters: BHP Billiton’s bid for Rio Tinto in 2008.) Its move shows Washington’s worries about the selling of U.S. companies to foreign counterparts — and its willingness to act. From Alan Rappeport, Cecilia Kang and Chad Bray of the NYT: With the White House making the case for more government intervention, Cfius is expected to gain more authority. A bipartisan group of lawmakers wants to expand the panel’s scope beyond mergers, giving it the power to review joint ventures and investments in start-ups. The deal context: Qualcomm filed for a review of the proxy fight on Jan. 29, before voting on the board contest began. But as of yesterday, Broadcom looked on course to win at least four seats, with a decent chance of six. Big index funds like BlackRock and Vanguard hadn’t voted yet. Bonus explainer: Everything you’d want to know about Cfius. In other foreign deals: The Chicago Stock Exchange’s proposed sale to Chinese investors is dead. Some institutional investors have talked about divesting their shares in gun makers like American Outdoor Brands and Vista Outdoor. (And some, like the Carlyle Group’s David Rubenstein, say they will never invest in the industry.) But, Andrew asks, what if those giants became shareholder activists to change those businesses? From his latest column: BlackRock has enormous influence over both gun makers and retailers. It could pressure them to raise the minimum age for buying AR-15-style rifles to 25 years old, and impose strict screening and background checks that go far beyond what is required by law. BlackRock could even push gun makers to stop producing such weapons altogether. The rub: Any decision has to be anchored by financial logic, since BlackRock and others have fiduciary duties to their own investors. But then gun makers are facing costs from boycotts by both consumers and businesses like REI. Elsewhere in guns: A bipartisan bill would require federal officials to notify state law enforcement within 24 hours if someone fails a national background check. And the dating app Bumble has banned gun-related images from user profiles.

Among the proponents is Randal Quarles, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision. Peter Eavis notes one group grateful for the Volcker Rule: investors in banks. The foreign bank campaign: Peter Eavis dived into how Deutsche Bank and others are trying to take advantage of a bill that would relax regulations for regional banks. In short: banks with less than $250 billion in assets would enjoy more relaxed rules, and foreign banks — which oversee less than $250 billion in assets in the U.S. — want in.

T2,6-Mar-18,"Advertisement By REUTERSMARCH 6, 2018, 9:37 A.M. E.S.T.
 LONDON/FRANKFURT —  German broadcaster ProSiebenSat 1 Media rejected a critical report on Tuesday by short-seller Viceroy Research, saying the allegations of questionable accounting contained in it were ""unfounded and distorting reality"". ProSieben's shares fell as much as 9 percent after the release of the report, which coincided with news the company was dropping out of Germany's DAX Index of blue-chip stocks. Viceroy, which has targeted companies including South African retailer Steinhoff, alleged in its 37-page report that ProSieben had overpaid for acquisitions and was inflating revenues from non-cash transactions. In particular, it took aim at ProSieben's media-for-equity model, in which it offers free advertising airtime on its channels in exchange for stakes in companies the broadcaster is investing in. Advertisement ""ProSieben has subsidized a fabricated digital 'growth story' using cash flows from its TV advertising business and idle TV advertising inventory,"" the report said. Advertisement ""As its core business declines, ProSieben can no longer counterbalance its underperforming digital segments - the earnings structure is on the brink of collapse."" Viceroy put a valuation of 7.51 euros (6.69 pounds) on ProSieben's shares, a 75 percent discount to Monday's closing price. In a statement, the Munich-based broadcaster dismissed Viceroy's allegations out of hand and said it would respond in more detail in due course ""The allegations of short-seller Viceroy contained in their report are unfounded and distorting reality,"" ProSieben said, reiterating its 2017 results and outlook published on Feb. 22. Viceroy's report into Steinhoff was followed by an admission of ""accounting irregularities"" that triggered an 85-percent slide in its share price. The South African government has, however, called for an investigation into Viceroy after a separate report on Capitec sparked a sell-off in the bank's stock.  . SHORT-SELLER TARGET ProSieben has for months been in the sights of short sellers - speculators who position themselves to profit from share-price falls - as the company was forced to issue a series of outlook downgrades due to weak TV ad revenues. Despite former CEO Thomas Ebeling's drive to diversify into business lines such as e-commerce, weak ad revenues eventually proved to be his undoing and he stepped down as CEO last month after nine years in charge. Advertisement He was replaced by Max Conze, former CEO at British vacuum cleaner maker Dyson. In December, Swedish hedge fund Bodenholm Capital disclosed a short position in ProSieben, saying the company was losing market share, as well as criticising the number of one-off costs the business reported. Other funds that have shorted Prosieben's shares include AQR Capital Management and Old Mutual Global Investors, according to German regulatory filings. Viceroy founder Fraser Perring told Reuters he had a fundamentally bearish take on the media sector, as young viewers flee and digital platforms attract advertisers. His attitude towards ProSieben's media-for-equity model was that ""it smacks of desperation"". ""They are recognising value of equity significantly higher than what it is worth. If they were a private equity firm, what is their strategy, what are their synergies?"" he told Reuters. More broadly, broadcast media faces an onslaught from platform giants like Amazon and Netflix with their video-on-demand offering of original TV content and Hollywood hits attracting millions of viewers. Netflix, whose shares have risen 64 percent so far this year, has added more than the equivalent of ProSieben's entire equity market value in the last two trading days alone. ProSieben's shares were down 5.2 percent at 28.47 euros as of 1330 GMT, valuing the company at about $8 billion.

T1,6-Mar-18,"Advertisement Supported by Square Feet New “hyperscale” data centers from the tech giants, part of a wave of global development, helped lead Prineville to a path of recovery. By Keith Schneider PRINEVILLE, ORE. — A decade ago, when five shuttered sawmills and 20 percent unemployment defined Crook County, Ore., nobody envisioned that the path to recovery would be tied to Facebook and Apple. But on the rimrock summit overlooking this city, the county seat and home to 10,000 residents, Facebook is sinking the footings for the first of two 450,000-square-foot data centers that together will cost $1 billion when completed in 2021. The immense buildings will join the four existing data centers, totaling 1.27 million square feet, that Facebook has built here since 2010 at a cost of $1.1 billion. They are among 11 centers the company has built in the United States and overseas. Nearby, Apple built its own $988 million, 660,000-square-foot data center, which the company will soon expand to one million square feet. It is one of seven built by Apple in the United States. One more is under construction in Iowa, and three others are planned in China, Denmark and Ireland, according to an Apple spokeswoman. The Facebook and Apple projects here are part of a wave of global data center construction and development, a market valued at $88 billion last year, according to Synergy Research Group, a market research firm in Reno, Nev. There’s not much architectural excitement about a data center. But the windowless, big-box buildings form the climate-controlled central nervous system of online commerce and communications. They are as essential to the basic economic infrastructure of the 21st century as iron ore mines and auto assembly plants were to the 20th. What distinguishes them is their size. Prineville’s Facebook and Apple centers are among 386 “hyperscale” data centers around the world, built and operated by the 24 biggest internet and technology companies, including Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, eBay, Microsoft and Yahoo. A study this year by Cisco, the Silicon Valley networking company, projected the number of hyperscale data centers to grow to 628 by 2021. Those centers could command more than half of all data center internet traffic. The United States accounts for more than half of all data center construction, Cisco said, followed by Asia, Western Europe and Latin America. A study in 2017 by CBRE Research found that certain metropolitan regions — Chicago, Detroit, New Jersey, New York, Northern Virginia and Silicon Valley — were the most active areas for data center construction in the United States. Like the big industrial projects of the previous century, the investments that Facebook, Apple and their competitors have made in land, buildings and equipment are considerable, typically more than $1 billion each. The centers consume prodigious amounts of electricity and water, just like factories. Property tax breaks that Oregon and other states use to lure data centers also are comparable. What is different is slim staffing. Facebook employs around 200 people here to manage buildings 1,000 feet long. Inside are aisle after aisle of computer servers networked to receive, store, stream and transmit the flood of digital bytes that steer daily life for more than two billion people. “The market is very big because the demand is huge,” said Rob Johnson, chief executive of Vertiv, a $4 billion global technology company in Columbus, Ohio, that designs, builds and supplies equipment to data centers. “Data centers serve the requirements for all the smartphones, streaming, high-definition video and all the new applications like autonomous vehicles. The technology is driving immense amounts of data and traffic.” Lucrative tax incentives are the rare area of data center development that has come under criticism. Iowa last year awarded Apple $208 million in tax breaks to build a $1.3 billion center in rural Waukee that would employ 50 people. “The big tech companies are getting huge tax breaks to build things they would build anyway,” said Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, a research group in Washington. “The cost to taxpayers is enormous for data centers that create very few permanent jobs.” Oregon’s incentive package allows both companies to avoid property taxes for 15 years, saving Facebook and Apple roughly $45 million each over that period. State law also has a sweetener for cities. Companies receiving the tax break are required to pay employees 150 percent of the median regional wage. Prineville data center workers earn at least $60,000 a year. Prineville counts 400 permanent jobs in the data centers, influencing its small-town culture, filling the municipal treasury and transforming its sagebrush and juniper landscape. Mayor Betty Roppe noted that Facebook and Apple provided Prineville with income from other municipal accounts. For instance, the city receives a 5 percent “franchise” fee on all electricity sales in its jurisdiction. Because Facebook’s and Apple’s centers consume nearly $40 million in electricity annually, total franchise fees last year reached $2.2 million, up from $340,000 in 2010. When the abatements expire midway through the 2020s, the value of Prineville’s taxable property will increase by roughly $2 billion, more than doubling the total from the $1.5 billion in property currently assessed by the city. Revenue is projected to reach $9 million annually, up from $4 million currently. “We were a cowboy and timber town,” said Steve Forrester, Prineville’s city manager and a former sawmill executive. “We went from ‘I got to go feed my cows’ to the most technically advanced companies in the world siting data centers in our little town. It freaked some people out.” Once-struggling Prineville has become a factor in turning central Oregon into a dynamic region of demographic and economic transition. It is becoming a bedroom community for Bend, 36 miles away, where the population has nearly doubled since 2000, making it the sixth-fastest-growing city in the country. The data centers also are changing the region’s electrical market. Avangrid Renewables just opened one of Oregon’s largest solar-generating stations outside Prineville, a $120 million, 56-megawatt plant to supply clean energy to Apple. Crook County authorities say they have entertained inquiries for building four more solar stations of similar size to supply data center needs. In 2009, when Ms. Roppe was a member of the City Council, she convened planning meetings with city executives to save Prineville from sawmill shutdowns and a deep recession. Her economic goals were straightforward: diversifying the economy and seeking companies willing to pay living wages. “Our unadjusted employment was 24 percent,” she said. “So we did whatever we had to do to change that.” When seven lawyers arrived in town to scout land for a company called Vitesse, she learned how competitive Prineville was to data center developers. The city and region fill all basic requirements — available land, ample electricity, access to fresh water, proximity to markets and generous tax breaks. Another advantage was cool summers — Facebook cools its data centers with fresh air. Ms. Roppe and her aides soon were made aware that Vitesse was a disguise for Facebook. The company bought 127 acres near the airport for $2.7 million and publicly revealed itself at a groundbreaking ceremony in January 2010. A year later, Apple’s scouts arrived as agents of a front company called Pillar. “We always were left guessing as to who we were dealing with,” Ms. Roppe said. In 2012, after buying 160 acres for $3.6 million, Apple started construction of its big data center. The presence of two big Silicon Valley companies once unnerved Prineville. Though most data center employees are from Crook County, young people wearing hoodies and driving late-model electric hybrid cars were a new presence in bars and on streets where cowboy hats and pickups once dominated. “There was anxiousness,” Mr. Forrester said. “The mill types were going around saying: ‘We don’t want the Mark Zuckerberg types. They’re going to ruin our town.’” Anxiety about newcomers has been replaced by relief over local business generated by the data centers, and new stress over rising housing costs. Residential and office vacancy rates are under 5 percent. “Facebook and Apple brought a lot to this community,” said Erika Vaughan, the owner of Cougar Cuts barbershop. “They are big, but they support small business.” Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS One subscription.Endless discovery.

 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc was sued on Thursday by a former executive who accused the world's largest retailer of issuing misleading e-commerce results, amid growing pressure from Amazon.com Inc, and firing him for complaining about it. Tri Huynh, a former director of business development, accused Walmart of having betrayed the principles of integrity and honesty espoused by founder Sam Walton in its push to show ""meteoric growth"" in e-commerce. The complaint alleges various wrongdoing, including the mislabeling of products, enabling Walmart to charge excessive sales commissions, and failure to properly process customer returns, enabling it to boost results. ""Wal-Mart cut corners and cheated in a race to expand and gain market-share,"" having been ""desperate to gain the ground it had long lost to Amazon,"" Huynh said in his complaint filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. Advertisement Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the litigation is based on allegations by a disgruntled former employee, who was let go when the business was restructured. Advertisement ""We take allegations like this seriously and looked into them when they were brought to our attention,"" he said. ""The investigation found nothing to suggest that the company acted improperly."" Walmart will vigorously defend itself against the claims, Hargrove added. The retailer's shares closed down 16 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $87.51, after earlier falling as much as 2 percent. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has spent billions of dollars in recent years to compete with Amazon, including through its 2016 purchase of Jet.com, and last month said quarterly online sales, including the December holidays, had risen 23 percent. But Amazon's sales in North America grew 40 percent in the same quarter, and analysts have said its price war has weighed on Walmart's margins. Huynh accused Walmart of charging higher sales commissions from sellers on its online marketplace, where third-party sellers list and sell products, with commissions rising as high as 15 percent compared with the normal 6 percent to 8 percent.  . Walmart's internal controls allegedly failed to detect the problem, causing the retailer to overstate revenue. Huynh also said Walmart failed to process more than $7 million of customer returns, inflating the total value of merchandise sold from September 2015 to March 2016. The plaintiff, who was born in Vietnam and lives in Washington state, said Walmart abruptly fired him in January 2017 in retaliation for his repeated complaints about its e-commerce reporting and internal controls. Advertisement Huynh said he was fired not long after raising concerns with U.S. e-commerce chief Marc Lore, and was dismissed under the ""false pretenses"" of a broader workforce reduction and alleged performance issues. He said he had told human resources the prior May of his efforts to deal with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. ""Wal-Mart sacrificed and betrayed its Founder's key principles of integrity and honesty, pushing those core values aside in its rush to win the E-commerce war at all costs,"" Huynh said. ""In doing this, it realized it must silence any whistleblower who spoke up."" The lawsuit, which accuses Walmart of violating the federal Sarbanes-Oxley whistleblower law and various California state laws, seeks punitive and other damages. The case is Huynh v Wal-Mart Stores Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-01631.

 The mood in the courtroom was hopeful when Toys “R” Us filed for bankruptcy last September. The company’s lawyer, in the first hearing, played a clip of the retailer’s famous jingle “I’m a Toys ‘R’ Us Kid” and vowed to restore the company’s place in the hearts of millions of American families. The reality is that Toys “R” Us, which announced on Thursday that it would shutter or sell all of its stores in the United States, never had much chance at a turnaround. For over a decade, Toys “R” Us had been drowning in $5 billion of debt, which its private equity backers had saddled it with. With debt payments siphoning off cash every year, Toys “R” Us could not properly invest in its worn-out suburban stores or outdated website. Sales plummeted, as Amazon captured more children’s desires — and their parents’ wallets — for Star Wars Legos and Paw Patrol recycling trucks. Toys “R” Us is the latest failure of financial engineering, albeit one that could portend a potentially more ominous outlook for private equity in the digital era. Advertisement Most buyouts tend to work the same way. A private equity firm takes over a troubled company with the goal of sprucing up the strategy, cutting costs and overhauling the business over three or five years. But they often load up a company with debt to pay for the deal, which can prove problematic if the profits do not perk up. Advertisement In the age of Amazon, that formula can be dangerous. Consumer demands are changing so quickly that heavily indebted companies have trouble reordering their business to adapt and compete with better-funded rivals. [ READ MORE: “It’s kind of a punch in the gut for us to see how much online shopping has affected things.” Customers across the United States told us what Toys “R” Us meant to them. Here’s what they had to say » ] A wave of buyouts has collapsed in recent weeks, felled by digital competition. Struggling in the streaming music age, iHeartMedia, the large radio company saddled with debt since its 2008 buyout, filed for bankruptcy this week. The regional New York grocery chain Tops filed for bankruptcy last month, citing competition from Amazon and the debt burden that its former private equity backers had heaped on it. Other buyouts are looking shaky. The television company Univision, which recently scrapped plans for a public offering, is shaking up its leadership. The parent company of the Winn-Dixie supermarket chain said this week it was seeking to restructure its debt, as it planned to close stores. Not all troubled private equity deals end with a company winding down, as in the case of Toys “R” Us. Retailers like Gymboree and Payless ShoeSource have found second lives after emerging from bankruptcy, often with investments from new private equity or hedge fund owners willing to give the business another try. But the deterioration of Toys “R” Us from a potential turnaround strategy to the end of an iconic brand — in a matter of months — shows just how difficult it can be for private equity to compete in a rapidly evolving industry. In retailing, Amazon is reordering everything on the store shelf. And children’s changing interest in games and toys, which now encompasses high-end electronics, adds to the complexity. The company said on Thursday that it had no other option than to begin winding down about 730 stores around the United States. Toys “R” Us was still looking at the possibility of keeping 200 stores open and combining them with its Canadian operations. But no deal had been struck yet. Advertisement “This is a profoundly sad day for us,” the Toys “R” Us chief executive, David Brandon, said in a statement, “as well as for the millions of kids and families who we have served for the past 70 years.” The toy business looked a lot simpler in 2005, when the private equity firms Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the real estate firm Vornado Realty Trust acquired the company for $6.6 billion. The investor group figured the toy industry was ripe for consolidation. After the buyout, Toys “R” Us bought the famed toy seller F.A.O. Schwarz as well as the brand and website of KB Toys. The company had become the world’s largest “toy showroom,” its shelves stocked with thousands of different actions figures, video games and other wares from large suppliers like Mattel and Hasbro as well as smaller brands that make stuffed animals and glow-in-the-dark slime. Sales were strong, even after the recession. The company had considered going public, giving its private equity owners a way to cash out. But the company scrapped the offering in 2013, citing unfavorable market conditions.  . Enter Amazon. In recent years, the company had started to aggressively expand its toy business, creating a comprehensive, online showroom with low prices at the click of a button. Pressed by Amazon, Walmart also pushed hard into toys, dropping its prices to capture more market share. Walmart could absorb the price cuts on toys because it makes up the profit on other items. But for Toys “R” Us, a price war on toys and games, its only offerings, was devastating. In 2015, the company hired Mr. Brandon as chief executive. The former head of the University of Michigan’s athletic department, he helped turn around Domino’s Pizza, another private equity investment. But he lacked extensive experience in the toy industry. By the time he joined Toys “R” Us, the company faced a conundrum. After a lack of investment, its stores were in need of a serious overhaul. Many American customers complained about its sprawling spaces and tired displays. But it was unclear whether those investments would pay off when parents were shopping increasingly on their laptops and smartphones. Money, too, was tight. Most of its debt, totaling about $5 billion, had not been paid down since the buyout 12 years earlier. It was paying $400 million in interest payments each year. Advertisement “This company had a long history of taking on debt and kicking the can down the road for 10 years, and refinancing,” said Douglas M. Foley, a lawyer at McGuireWoods, who is representing a lender in the Toys “R” Us bankruptcy. With sales falling and debt payments mounting, the company’s lawyer said in September that Toys “R” Us had “too much debt.” It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, seeking to shed some of its debt and reorganize its business. The company secured new loans to keep operating into the critical holiday selling season and said it would hire hundreds of seasonal workers to help improve customer service. But the holidays were a bust for Toys “R” Us, even as other retailers reported strong sales. On Thursday, the company said that its earnings during the shopping season were $250 million less than expected. The lenders, which had given the company considerable leeway during the holidays, lost confidence in the turnaround plan. “The business plan was underwhelming, that is best way to say it,” Mr. Foley said. The company has been hemorrhaging money. Mr. Foley calculated that the company had spent nearly $50 million on legal, banking and consulting fees from September through January. The lenders determined that they needed to stop burning through cash and start selling off the company’s inventory and real estate. The company said on Thursday that it talked to several possible buyers of its American operations. But it could not complete a sale, leading to its demise. “The retail industry is going through such a convulsion, it is not clear what the end of the road looks like,” said Stephen B. Selbst, a bankruptcy lawyer at Herrick Feinstein. “If you are an equity investor, you probably think ‘you know what? I have other uses for my money.” A version of this article appears in print on March 16, 2018, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: This Toy Story Foreshadowed Its Sad Ending.

 SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE —  Deutsche Post AG's DHL said on Thursday it was launching a delivery service for online retailers in eight U.S. cities, as the German logistics company takes a swipe at dominant players UPS and FedEx. Through DHL eCommerce's Parcel Metro service, first reported by Reuters, contractors will make same-day or next-day deliveries from retailers and fulfillment centers directly to homes, the company said. ""This sector (e-commerce) offers a tremendous amount of opportunity to the logistics space,"" DHL eCommerce Americas Chief Executive Officer Lee Spratt said when announcing the service at an event in San Francisco. Cowen & Co analyst Helane Becker said she believes Amazon is working with DHL to expand its presence in the United States. Advertisement ""Amazon is growing 35+ percent per year, and they need to figure out a way to get stuff to the buyers. FedEx and UPS have told Amazon they won't scale with them, meaning that Amazon has to figure out a way to support their delivery network themselves,"" Becker said. Advertisement ""It also helps that DHL's U.S. hub is in Cincinnati and that is where Amazon is building their air hub. We don't think that's a coincidence,"" she added. DHL eCommerce Chief Executive Charles Brewer told Reuters Amazon is a large customer but Parcel Metro was not designed with Amazon in mind. Amazon and FedEx did not immediately respond to requests for comment. UPS said it does not comment on competitor business strategies.  . DHL has been testing Parcel Metro in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York for the last two years, the company said. It will roll out in Dallas, Atlanta, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. by end-2018 and look to add other global cities in the years ahead, it said. Parcel Metro relies on third-party contract couriers and app-based driver pools to pick up products like books, shoes, shampoo, and electronics from retailers or warehouses and deliver the items directly to households, Spratt said. Parcel Metro will offer delivery windows ranging from two hours, to same-day, and next day, and could add a Saturday delivery option, Spratt said. For less-urgent e-commerce orders, DHL will continue its years-long practice of handing off packages to the U.S. Postal Service for ""final-mile"" delivery, it said. DHL's move is a gamble. The company lost billions of dollars on a failed U.S. expansion a decade ago. https://tinyurl.com/y9wu42dt Parcel Metro follows DHL's plans, announced in summer 2016, to spend $137 million on seven new or expanded e-commerce fulfillment centers in the United States, where DHL currently delivers roughly 500 million pieces annually.

 (Reuters) - Toy retailer Toys 'R' Us Inc on Thursday asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for approval to stop paying all of its suppliers while it tries to line up buyers for its international business ahead of a planned liquidation of its U.S. operations. The iconic toy store's plan to liquidate inventory and shutter or sell its U.S. stores has put 30,000 jobs at risk and left vendors wondering where to send merchandise stuck on ships and trucks, and whether their invoices will ever get paid, lawyers said at a court hearing on Thursday. As shoppers flock to Amazon.com Inc and children choose smartphones and screens over toys, Toys 'R' Us has struggled to boost sales and service debt following a $6.6-billion leveraged buyout by private equity firms in 2005. At a hearing at U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Richmond, Virginia, Toys 'R' Us lawyer Joshua Sussberg said the company was working to avoid any contagion from the U.S. liquidation on the foreign businesses it is trying to sell. Advertisement Part of that effort means separating the U.S. business from foreign operations to ensure that shipments can reach stores in Canada, Europe and Asia, where the company will be reviewing bid proposals in coming weeks. Advertisement But lawyers for vendors said they did not know whether they would ever get paid for those goods. Kenneth Eckstein, a lawyer on behalf of the official committee of unsecured creditors, called the precipitous liquidation ""extremely disappointing and sad,"" noting that hundreds of vendors, thousands of employees and millions of customers will suffer. ""This is the largest and most rapid deterioration of a retailer and maybe that any Chapter 11 has ever entertained,"" he said. LIQUIDATION Toys 'R' Us - the last major retailer focusing solely on toys - plans to liquidate inventory at 735 U.S. stores, including Babies 'R' Us locations, by the end of this year. The wind-down follows a bruising holiday season, when the company failed to stay competitive and sales came in well below projections. The quarter accounts for 40 percent of its annual net sales. With the disappearance of Toys 'R' Us, everything from squishies and slime kits made by small companies, to board games and Barbie dolls by heavyweights Hasbro Inc and Mattel Inc, will lose a top customer. Hasbro said the pending liquidation and closure is expected to be ""disruptive"" in the near term. Lutz Muller, president of consultancy Klosters Trading Corp, estimated a single-digit sales impact on companies like Mattel, Hasbro, Spin Master Corp, Jakks Pacific Inc, Funko Inc and MGA Entertainment Inc. ""Bad but not fatal,"" Muller said. ""But for the little guys that depended on Toys 'R' Us as a major showcase ... a large number will go to the wall."" Jefferies predicted the bankruptcy would depress 2018 revenue across the industry by between 2.5 percent and 5.5 percent. It said 40 percent of the toy sales up for grabs would flow to Amazon and 30 percent to Walmart Inc.  . Shares of Mattel fell nearly 3 percent while shares of Hasbro were trading slightly lower on Thursday; they had tumbled last week on Toys 'R' Us' liquidation reports. Advertisement Toys 'R' Us' creditors said in a court filing that Target Corp, Walmart and Amazon pricing toys at low margins, and a greater-than-expected decline in toy and gift card sales following its bankruptcy filing in September, led to the weak performance in the quarter. TOYS ABROAD Wayne, New Jersey-based Toys 'R' Us was already in the process of closing one-fifth of its stores as part of an attempt to emerge from one of the largest ever bankruptcies by a specialty retailer. In September, when the company operated more than 1,600 stores globally, with roughly 800 stores outside the United States, it got court permission to borrow more than $2 billion to start paying suppliers. But efforts to keep the business going collapsed after lenders decided they could recover more in a liquidation by closing stores and raising money from merchandise sales. Seventy-year-old Toys 'R' Us does not rule out a last-minute offer for all of its stores and said it will announce the winning bidder of a March 29 auction on April 12. More than 8,000 U.S. retail stores closed in 2017, roughly double the average annual store closures in the previous decade, according to data from the International Council of Shopping Centers. Despite the threat of 30,000 job losses, experts do not expect retail employment and wages to be subdued in the near term. Approximately 700,000 jobs in the industry need to be filled, say retail staffing firms and trade federations such as the NRF. Aly Sanchez, a two-year employee of Toys R Us in Kansas City, said, ""It's an overwhelming feeling not knowing what’s going to happen.

 LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO —  Streaming music leader Spotify used its cultural cool factor to appeal to mom-and-pop investors in an unconventional presentation ahead of its April 3 stock market listing. Led by 35-year-old Chief Executive Daniel Ek, wearing jeans, white t-shirt and a dark blazer, executives said Spotify would prioritize growth over profits to fend off big rivals Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc, while also seeing a clear path to making money. Ek's team made a direct case to individual investors in a public webcast instead of a traditional closed-door road show typically used to woo institutional investors in initial public offerings (IPOs). The Stockholm-based company's stock will hit the public markets in a direct listing without traditional underwriters. It must convince investors that its business is sound and that investors who buy shares in the public market debut will not be hurt by unexpected volatility. Advertisement ""You won't see us ringing any bells or throwing any parties,"" Ek said. ""Since Spotify isn't selling any stock in the listing, we're really entirely focused on the long-term performance of the business."" Advertisement The direct listing is critical to alleviating Spotify's losses, which are driven by financing costs, and will enable all late-stage investors to convert debt holdings into equity. Spotify's revenue grew 39 percent to 4.09 billion euros ($5.04 billion) in 2017 from 2.95 billion euros in 2016, it said in a securities filing. At the same time, net financing costs of 855 million euros pushed up operating losses to 378 million euros from 349 million euros. Chief Financial Officer Barry McCarthy, the former long-serving CFO of streaming video giant Netflix Inc, said Spotify's strategy was to prioritize growth before short-term profitability, and that greater scale would enable profit margins to swell. With 71 million subscribers at the end of 2017, Spotify is the leader in streaming music. It also has 92 million users of its free, advertising-supported service, which it says delivers a constant stream of converts to its paid offering. That will keep it ahead of Apple, the company believes. Tomas Otterbeck, an equities analyst with Swedish research firm Redeye, said he was impressed by McCarthy repeating the idea that ""We are playing a market share game"" and that Spotify could reach 100 million paying subscribers by early next year. The independent service is jockeying against efforts from Apple, which has 38 million paid listeners and eschews  advertising-supported services.  . Apple, Spotify, Google and other services charge around $9.99 a month for music subscriptions. Amazon Prime service subscribers can get the music service for $7.99 a month. Ek portrayed Spotify as an underdog not tied to a major technology company, describing a strategy to be a ubiquitous music service available across phones, computers, smart speakers and car entertainment systems. Advertisement Because the company will not issue any new shares, it did not specify a listing price. Based on private transactions, it is valued at roughly $19 billion, according to Reuters calculations. It has hired brokerage Morgan Stanley to match buy and sell orders to set its opening trading price and said it will provide financial guidance to investors on March 26. STAYING AHEAD McCarthy spelled out Spotify’s long-term operating targets for generating sustained free cash flow, with annual revenue growth between 25 and 35 percent and gross margin between 30 and35 percent - ambitious for a loss-making company. Helping listeners find new bands and songs is an ""infinitely larger"" opportunity in music than so-called discovery was for video, McCarthy said, comparing Netflix’s rapid rise from mail-order DVD distribution into a streaming media service to Spotify’s audio streaming business. Spotify could devour the $28 billion, advertising-driven radio market, he said. Advertising makes up only about 10 percent of Spotify's current revenue, and McCarthy said he would be ""thrilled"" if Spotify could pull in 20 percent of its revenue from ads, although he expressed some doubt about whether the company could hit that mark. “There is an enormous pay-off for whoever wins. Now it remains to be seen whether we will win, but that's the game we are playing,"" he said.

T1,15-Mar-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin MARCH 15, 2018
 Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Wells Fargo’s C.E.O. gets a pay raise. • Peter Thiel discusses trade. • Theranos’s fall is nearly complete. • Why John Skipper left ESPN abruptly. • Alibaba is exploring a China listing. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. There will be no roadshow. No ringing of the bell. No party or C.E.O interview from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Spotify, the streaming music service, is eschewing the traditional initial public offering for a direct listing and is taking its pitch directly to retail investors, streaming its presentation on its website Thursday. Advertisement Here are a few takeaways: Why a direct listing? The post-I.P.O. lockup period, during which employees can’t sell shares. “We have allowed shareholders and employees to buy and sell stock for years,” said Daniel Ek, Spotify’s C.E.O.and founder, said. “That shouldn’t stop just because our stock is more widely owned.” Advertisement The company is also well capitalized with positive free cash flow and no debt. Room to Grow? The number of smartphone users to continues to grow but Spotify said it only reaches a small portion within the countries it operates. The company is also working with auto makers to integrate its platform with cars, where more than 30 percent of music listening happens. Apple and Amazon are a big risk to Spotify’s business? Tech giants like Apple, Amazon and Google each have their own streaming music services. Spotify’s service is delivered over Apple’s iPhone and Amazon’s Echo. Those companies could prioritize their own services on their devices. What is the next date to watch? March 26. That’s the date when Spotify will release first-quarter results and 2018 guidance. What is “algotorial?” It’s the term that Spotify’s head of research and development used to describe the mix of algorithms and humans that Spotify uses to curate its music. Regulators recently penalized Wells Fargo for years of misconduct, but on Wednesday, the bank gave its C.E.O. a hearty pay rise. How did that happen? The numbers: Timothy J. Sloan’s compensation for 2017 totaled $17.6 million, a 35 percent increase from the $13 million he earned in 2016. His stock award for 2017 was $15 million, a big jump from $10.5 million in 2016. Is the increase justified, given the bank’s issues? Wells Fargo would no doubt point to the fact that Mr. Sloan decided to forgo a cash bonus in 2017. John G. Stumpf, a former C.E.O., got a $4 million cash bonus in 2015, for instance. Also, Mr. Sloan’s stock award was set in February last year and reflects his promotion in 2016 to C.E.O. And if Wells Fargo slips up badly over the next three years, Mr. Sloan may not get the entire $15 million stock award. Advertisement How does Mr. Sloan’s pay stack up against others? He is making less than the C.E.O. of Bank of America, Brian T. Moynihan, who made $21.8 million last year. But Mr. Sloan is making quite a bit more than the chief executives of large regional banks. US Bank’s chief executive, Andrew Cecere, had 2017 compensation of $12 million. But Mr. Sloan looks overpaid on a new metric that public companies must provide. This yardstick compares a C.E.O.’s pay with that of the median employee’s pay. Mr. Sloan’s 2017 pay was 291 times that of Wells Fargo’s median earner. That is above the 250 times for Mr. Moynihan. And Mr. Sloan’s ratio is far in excess of Mr. Cecere’s 205 times. — Peter Eavis One of President Trump’s most prominent supporters in the business world on Thursday said the United States would have the upper hand against China in a trade skirmish. Peter Thiel, a technology entrepreneur with libertarian leanings, told the Economic Club of New York that the United States doesn’t export enough to China to make it vulnerable to Chinese retaliation. If Mr. Trump imposed trade restrictions on Chinese goods, as he may in the coming weeks, China could do the same to United States exports. Mr. Thiel seemed unfazed by that. “It’s quite unclear where China can reciprocate because we are exporting so little,” he said. Mr. Thiel’s views echo those of Mr. Trump. 
            When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore-we win big. It’s easy!         The American exports to China are not small. They totaled $184 billion in the 12 months through the end of September 2017. That makes China the United States’ fourth-largest export market after the European Union, Canada and Mexico. The United States, however, imports far more from China than it exports, which means the deficit with China is far larger than it is with Mexico and the European Union. - Peter Eavis The blood-testing start-up was once one of Silicon Valley’s most lauded unicorns. But, the S.E.C. says, it deceived investors about what its tech could do and how much business it did. And its founder Elizabeth Holmes — a Stanford dropout who was compared favorably to Steve Jobs — has been stripped of her C.E.O. title and her shares. More from John Carreyrou of the WSJ, who first reported on issues at Theranos: Many Theranos investors have lost the entire value of their investment. The losses for [Rupert] Murdoch, once the company’s largest investor, total more than $100 million, people familiar with the matter said. The S.E.C. said in its civil lawsuit Wednesday that Theranos was “on the verge of bankruptcy” in late 2017. The company has been kept afloat by a loan from a private-equity firm that is secured by Theranos’s patents. Matt Levine of Bloomberg View reminds us about the company’s other victims: patients. Peter Henning’s take: The S.E.C.’s case shows that it considers privately held companies as capable of defrauding investors as publicly traded ones. Elsewhere in S.E.C. violations: The agency charged a former Equifax executive with insider trading, saying he sold shares after learning of the company’s data breach before it was publicly reported. It’s official: The CNBC commentator will become President Trump’s chief economic adviser, replacing Gary Cohn. But what will Mr. Kudlow — who on TV is an ardent supporter of free trade — push for? Advertisement He supports a strong dollar and tariffs that make exceptions for allies like Canada and Mexico. And he’s in favor of permanently extending the Republican tax cuts for individuals. As for his stance on China, here’s what he told CNBC: “A thought that I have is the United States could lead a coalition of large trading partners and allies against China, or to let China know that they’re breaking the rules left and right.” One thing to watch for: whether his past admission of substance abuse would affect his work. “We’ll see how that plays out,” Mr. Kudlow said. Critics’ corner: Mark Hamrick, Bankrate.com’s senior economic analyst, writes, “It remains to be seen whether Kudlow can step into the role of a virtual moderating influence in this administration.” And Noah Smith of Bloomberg View asserts, “It also seems like there are just so few credible economic thinkers willing to stand up and sign their name to the Trump economic agenda.” Elsewhere in economic policy: U.S. companies have few ways around the proposed metals tariffs. And U.S. allies might emphasize their toughness against China to win tariff exemptions. Mr. Kudlow has prognosticated on many economic and political issues, often in a way that mirrors his future boss. His predictions, which will soon carry new weight as the president’s top economic adviser, have not always been on the mark. Our colleagues Deborah Solomon and Kitty Bennett take a look at some of Mr. Kudlow’s not-so-on-the-money calls. Here are a few of the ones they found: In 2005 “All the bond bears have been dead wrong in predicting sky-high mortgage rates. So have all the bubbleheads who expect housing-price crashes in Las Vegas or Naples, Fla., to bring down the consumer, the rest of the economy and the entire stock market.” (Well, we all know what happened. By 2008, home prices were in a free-fall, threatening to plunge the financial system and the economy into the abyss.) In 1993 “There’s no question that President Clinton’s across-the-board tax increases on labor, capital and energy will throw a wet blanket over the recovery and depress the economy’s long-run potential to grow.” (The period between 1990 and 1999 was the longest bull market in history. The S&P 500 more than tripled during that time.) Advertisement In 2015 “Given the recent rise of presidential candidate Donald Trump, we should all be thankful that stocks haven’t plunged. Trump’s agenda of trade protectionism, dollar devaluation, and immigrant deportation is completely anti-growth. It’s like Fortress America in an economy that is completely globalized and where the U.S. must compete in the worldwide race for capital and labor. Trump’s policies don’t fit.” (President Trump was elected and the stock market has only climbed. ) • How Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone became a close adviser to President Trump on China — but lost the tariff battle.

I foreclosed that possibility by disclosing the details to my family, and then when I discussed it with Bob, he and I agreed that I had placed the company in an untenable position and as a result, I should resign.” The WSJ reports that the Chinese online shopping giant is working on a plan to list shares in its home market. Such a listing would come nearly four years after Alibaba went public on the New York Stock Exchange, in what is the still the world’s largest initial public offering. Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . Details • A secondary listing could happen as soon as this summer, The WSJ reports. • China’s security regulators would have to change rules that bar foreign companies from listing in the country. Alibaba is incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Advertisement • China also doesn’t allow companies with dual-class share structure to list in the country. Context Alibaba’s plans come as “Chinese authorities are trying to lure some of the country’s technology stalwarts back to its capital markets,” The WSJ reports. Alibaba’s stock has jumped nearly 200 percent since it went public in 2014, gains that most Chinese investors have missed out on. Shares of Alibaba are up 3.1 percent Thursday. Christian Bittar, a former senior trader at Deutsche Bank, pleaded guilty earlier this month to conspiracy to defraud in the manipulation of a global benchmark interest rate known as Euribor, the Serious Fraud Office said on Thursday. A court in Britain lifted an order on Thursday that prevented the media from reporting his plea. “It would not be right to make comment prior to the trial of the remaining defendants and prior to Mr. Bittar’s sentencing,” David Savell, a lawyer for Mr. Bittar, said. Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $2.5 billion in penalties in 2015 related to the benchmark interest rate rigging scandal. A trial of five other traders is set for next month. - Chad Bray The Senate, in a rare show of bipartisanship, voted 67-31 to relax regulations on small to medium-sized banks. What the bill includes: • Raising the threshold for “systemically important” banks to $250 billion in assets, up from $50 billion • Exempting firms with less than $10 billion in assets from the Volcker rule But the House may want a more aggressive version that would curtail the power of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That could endanger the proposed overhaul, with the analyst Brian Gardner telling the NYT, “If the House overreaches in its effort to amend the Crapo bill, it could slow down the bill’s progress.” Elsewhere in banking: Why another Bear Stearns-like collapse isn’t likely, but another crisis is. The 70-year-old company’s plans to close or sell its stores in the U.S. and Britain show how hard life has become for bricks-and-mortar retailers. The collapse could put over 30,000 U.S. jobs at risk. Advertisement More on what happened from Michael Corkery of the NYT: Weighed down by the debt that its owners heaped on the company when they bought it, Toys “R” Us has not adequately invested in its fading stores and e-commerce operations. Unable to compete with other retailers, it has lost market share to better capitalized toy sellers. Speaking of Amazon: The company has become shorthand for “disruption” across industries. The current generation of Silicon Valley giants started out with an ethos of revolution first, fixes afterward. (Remember Facebook’s “move fast and break things” motto?) But Facebook, Google and others are becoming more bureaucratic, according to our columnist Kevin Roose — and that’s a good thing.

 (Reuters) - Kroger Co forecast full-year profit below Wall Street's estimates on Thursday as its investments to fend off Walmart Inc and Amazon.com Inc squeeze the grocer's margins, sending its shares tumbling almost 13 percent. The owner of some 2,800 supermarkets, including Ralphs, Harris Teeter, Fred Meyer and Mariano's, will use benefits from lower corporate taxes to expand services like home delivery, curbside pickup and self-checkout under its broad ""Restock Kroger"" program to make shopping more convenient and affordable, trading off capital spending for profits. Executives said they were accelerating investment planned for the 2019-2020 and forecast 2018 earnings of $1.95 per share to $2.15 per share, dipping below analysts' consensus target of $2.15 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ""You should expect gross margin to decline somewhat in 2018,"" Chief Financial Officer Michael Schlotman said on a conference call with analysts. Advertisement ""We're positioning the company to start growing again"" in 2019 and 2020, Chief Executive Rodney McMullen added. Advertisement Wall Street has not been patient since Amazon burst into the physical supermarket business with its $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods Market last year. Kroger ""offered more of the same tough medicine in its (2018) guidance, with a heavy dose of margin reinvestment implied,"" said MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Montani. ""Bears will seize on today's news as further evidence of the heightened competition and impact of rising wages befalling brick and mortar retailers in the Age of Amazon,"" Montani said. The Cincinnati-based company also is refining its product assortment, pricing, marketing and customer service under Restock Kroger amid a brutal price war with rivals ranging from Walmart to German discounters Aldi and Lidl.  . CEO McMullen said Kroger would not cede ground to those competitors, nor would it make the price war worse. ""We're not going to lose on price, but we're not out there trying to lead the market down,"" McMullen said on the conference call. Kroger plans $3 billion of capital expenditures in 2018, in line with 2017. It also expects to close the sale of 800 convenience stores to British gas station operator EG Group for $2.15 billion later this year and use the proceeds to buy back shares and pay down debt. That sale is not included in its 2018 profit forecast. Kroger's sales for the fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, rose 12.4 percent to $31.03 billion, topping analysts' target of $30.83 billion. Identical same-store sales were up 1.5 percent, edging past analysts' estimate of 1.45 percent, and the sales forecast for 2018 was roughly in line with expectations, a sign that customers are not abandoning Kroger. Advertisement Net earnings attributable to Kroger jumped 68.8 percent to $854 million, or 96 cents per share. Gross margin was 21.9 percent of sales for the fourth quarter. Excluding fuel, the 53rd week and a credit and charge for last-in-first-out inventory accounting, gross margin decreased 31 basis points from the same period last year. Kroger's shares had gained about 16 percent in the past six months before dropping 12.7 percent to $22.91 in midday trading. (In second paragraph, this story adds dropped word, ""will"".)

 For weeks, users of Amazon’s digital assistant, Alexa, have reported versions of the same unsettling event: being startled as they went about their day by Alexa letting out an eerie laugh. Now, Amazon says that it knows why that’s been happening and is working to fix the problem. “In rare circumstances, Alexa can mistakenly hear the phrase ‘Alexa, laugh,’” when other words are spoken, Amazon said in an emailed statement. “We are changing that phrase to be ‘Alexa, can you laugh?’ which is less likely to have false positives, and we are disabling the short utterance ‘Alexa, laugh.’” The company also said that instead of simply laughing when asked, the digital assistant, which is accessible through its line of Echo and Fire devices, will first acknowledge the request, saying, “Sure, I can laugh.” One user said on Twitter that he was talking to his sister when he heard his device laugh. He had stopped the conversation and began searching online for an explanation of what had just occurred. Finding nothing, he asked Alexa to repeat the last sound she had made.

Advertisement The episode underscored the concerns swirling around Echo and other smart speakers, like Google Home, which often sit in intimate spaces, awaiting a call to action. Advertisement Critics have argued that the always-on devices pose a threat to privacy and security. There have been reports of children ordering items through the devices without parental consent, and last year Burger King took advantage of the devices by incorporating a command into a commercial. Despite those concerns, the technology has been widely embraced. Reports vary on just how many Americans use such devices, but all suggest that adoption is relatively high. On Tuesday, for example, the polling organization Gallup and Northeastern University reported that about one in five American adults use an intelligent home device such as Alexa, Google Home or other competing devices.

 SAO PAULO —  Amazon.com Inc met in Brazil last week with an array of manufacturers to discuss plans to stock and sell products from consumer electronics to perfume in the country, according to two people that took part in the meetings. The move would take the U.S. e-commerce giant beyond its current role in Brazil as a marketplace for third-party sellers, representing a major advance into the biggest retail market in Latin America. Amazon representatives in Brazil declined to comment on the talks, adding that the company had held ""hundreds of meetings with potential vendors and suppliers about its business in Brazil and possible future plans"" in the past five years. Amazon has waded slowly into Brazil's complex and highly competitive online retail market, starting with e-book sales in 2012, adding physical books two years later and offering third-party sales of electronics in October. Advertisement Yet the company appears to be accelerating its expansion this year as the Brazilian economy exits a painful recession, stiffening competition for local rivals such as Mercado Libre Inc, B2w Cia Digital, Via Varejo SA and Magazine Luiza SA. Advertisement Shares of Magazine Luiza fell 2 percent in Thursday trading and Via Vareja dropped nearly 3 percent. B2W, which reported a quarterly loss and a change of chief executives on Wednesday, tumbled 10 percent, while the benchmark Bovespa stock index was little changed.  . Last month, the same stocks suffered when Reuters reported that Amazon was looking to lease a large warehouse just outside of Sao Paulo. E-commerce accounts for around 5 percent of Brazil's roughly $300 billion retail market — about half its share in the United States — but has doubled in the past four years and is forecast to keep growing annually at a double-digit pace. Amazon representatives, including senior executive Ticiana Mártyres, told several dozen potential suppliers gathered at the Hotel Blue Tree Morumbi last week that the company planned to use its own transportation and call centers in Brazil, according to one of the sources. ""They said they were going to buy directly from the manufacturers and resell,"" said the person, who requested anonymity due to the confidential terms of the talks. Amazon said it would store goods at its facilities in Greater Sao Paulo, the source added.

 NEW YORK —  Kroger's fourth-quarter profit soared 70 percent, mainly due to a large tax benefit. But its stock dropped 12 percent Thursday after it gave a disappointing earnings outlook as it spends more to compete with Amazon. Grocers have been racing to boost their digital efforts, especially since Amazon acquired grocer Whole Foods and its 470 stores last year. So far, the online retailer has cut prices on some Whole Foods items and recently began offering free, two-hour delivery in six cities with plans for a nationwide rollout. Kroger offers delivery and online ordering-and-pickup in some stores; it said Thursday that digital sales jumped 90 percent in 2017 from the year before. CEO Rodney McMullen told analysts in a conference call that the company is balancing the desires of shoppers for delivery, pickup and in-store shopping, and that many customers do all three. ""So for us, you should expect to see us continually expanding the way customers can engage with us and do that digitally and with the mobile app,"" he said. ""And we'll continue to make investments in those areas."" Advertisement The Cincinnati-based company said it expects full-year earnings of $1.95 per share to $2.15 per share. Wall Street analysts expected $2.15 per share.  . Kroger Co. shares fell $3.25 to $22.98 on Thursday. The company, which also owns the Ralphs, Dillons and King Soopers supermarkets, said it earned $854 million, or 96 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, helped by a $957 million tax benefit, with about $400 million coming from the recent tax changes.

 SHANGHAI —  China has approved the Shanghai listing of an internet and industrial-focused subsidiary of Taiwan's Foxconn, which the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer hopes will help fund new projects. Foxconnn, whose clients include Amazon, Apple , Cisco, Dell [DI.UL], Huawei [HWT.UL] and Lenovo, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission confirmed the approval in statements issued on Thursday. This followed an earlier Reuters report that the Foxconn unit had obtained the regulatory go-ahead for the planned IPO. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, has been aiming to list the unit, Foxconn Industrial Internet Co Ltd (FII), on the Shanghai Stock Exchange to help fund projects in smart manufacturing, cloud computing and 5G solutions. Advertisement The firm said previously that around 10 percent of the unit's shares would be converted to floating stock, with parent Foxconn holding onto around 85 percent of the shares. Foxconn shareholders approved the plan in January. So far, it has not announced details of the IPO. Last month, the company said it planned to use proceeds from the listing to fund eight projects totaling 27.3 billion yuan ($4.31 billion). The subsidiary unit makes electronic devices, cloud service equipment and industrial robots. Advertisement Foxconn Industrial Internet made a net profit of 16.2 billion yuan in 2017.

 PARIS —  Retailer Casino delivered a cautious profit outlook on Thursday that hit its share price, as the French company grapples with reviving profits in its main markets of France and Brazil. Casino, which faces tough competition in France and a recession in Brazil, said it will step up its online offerings in the face of challenges from Amazon and will cut debt after it rose sharply in 2017. The retailer said it expects to grow profits in 2018 with the help of cost savings as it posted a 20.1 percent jump in its 2017 operating profit to 1.242 billion euros, which included 198 million euros (176.67 million pounds) in tax credits in Brazil. Casino's finance chief Antoine Giscard d'Estaing told a news conference he considered analysts estimates for 2018 earnings of 1.24 billion euros before interest and tax (EBIT), as ""a floor"". Advertisement Casino is aiming to deliver organic growth in consolidated operating profit above 10 percent, excluding tax credits. Advertisement Tax credits in Brazil would again be ""significant"" this year, d'Estaing said. Casino's shares were down by 5.3 percent at 41.96 euros in late session trading, among the worst performers on the Paris and broader European markets as investors were left unconvinced. The company's credit rating was cut to junk by Standard & Poor's in March 2016. Gregoire Laverne, a fund manager at Roche-Brune Asset Management, said the fall was due to a ""lack of clarity and many non-recurring items in 2017 results which worry the market."" ""We don't own any Casino shares because the quality of its results and the chances of the company producing a better performance are not that good,"" added Laverne. Analysts at brokerage Bryan Garnier kept a ""neutral"" rating on Casino shares, saying its earnings outlook was cautious.  . HOME MARKET IMPROVES Casino kept its 2017 dividend unchanged at 3.12 euros and said it would improve cash flow and cut its net debt this year through asset sales such as Brazilian appliance and electronics unit Via Varejo, which it has put up for sale. Via Varejo's sale process was still underway and management was not rushing to ""press the sale button"" as the unit's performance and valuation was improving, said Casino chairman and chief executive Jean-Charles Naouri. Casino will expand its online offering through a deal to use UK online retailer Ocado's platform. There are signs of improvement in the home market which contributes 55 percent of group sales, Casino said, with profits in France rising 9.5 percent to 556 million euros. It is targeting organic growth in France of above 10 percent in operating profit for 2018, excluding real estate activities. Advertisement In France, Casino has cut prices at Geant hypermarkets and reduced retail space for non-food items in response to competition from online and smaller convenience stores. It has also increased its focus on organic and fresh food products. In Brazil, where Casino controls retailer Grupo Pao de Acucar (GPA), the group's performance was helped by the success of a cash-and-carry format. Casino shares, which rose 10.9 percent in 2017, have fallen around nearly 20 percent so far in 2018, underperforming their European sector.

 The health insurance giant Cigna said on Thursday that it had agreed to buy Express Scripts, the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, in a $52 billion deal that could further reshape the roiling health care landscape. The deal is the latest in a wave of consolidations that is sweeping through the health care industry. Companies are reacting to concerns over rising health care costs and the possibility of powerful new rivals entering the fray. In particular, Amazon’s move into the health care business has forced established companies to rethink how they can compete. Cigna and Express Scripts said the acquisition would benefit consumers by allowing the two companies to bring together patients’ medical and pharmacy histories to improve treatments and lower costs. “This step furthers our strategy to improve the affordability and value to the consumer in a more personalized way,” said Cigna’s chief executive, David Cordani, who will serve as chief executive for the combined company. Advertisement The completion of the deal would mark the end of Express Scripts as the last major independent pharmacy benefit manager, one that has focused on striking deals with drug companies to lower costs for insurers and employers. The company is responsible for the prescription plans of more than 80 million Americans. Advertisement “This is the future of the stand-alone” pharmacy benefit manager, said Tim Wentworth, the chief executive of Express Scripts, who would serve as president of the Express Scripts business under the deal. The two companies said that they would continue to offer pharmacy services to other insurers and to employers that do not use Cigna. The deal would ensure that all of the major pharmacy benefit managers would have ties to big insurers. CVS Health, which also owns pharmacies, recently announced a merger agreement with the health insurer Aetna. OptumRx is owned by the insurance giant UnitedHealth Group. Anthem, which operates for-profit Blue Cross plans in several states, said it had plans to create its own pharmacy business. With no other large independent pharmacy managers left for smaller insurers, federal and state officials could be reluctant to approve the Cigna-Express Scripts deal, said David A. Balto, an antitrust lawyer who worked at the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department who is a fierce critic of mergers of insurers and pharmacy managers. The CVS-Aetna deal could face the same problem, he said. “History has shown where there are multiple mergers going on in a single industry, the Justice Department goes on high alert,” Mr. Balto said. Other antitrust experts said it was unclear how the combination of Cigna and Express Scripts would reshape the market. “It’s not nearly as obvious an antitrust risk as other deals,” said Leemore S. Dafny, a business professor at Harvard. The deal could make the insurance industry more competitive by giving Cigna, which is not a major player in some markets, a way to challenge the dominant companies, she said. Health insurers, thwarted by federal regulators in their attempts to combine with one another, have been hunting for possible acquisitions. Thursday’s deal came little over a year after a judge blocked a proposed $48 billion merger of Cigna and Anthem. A judge also blocked a $37 billion deal between Aetna and another health insurer, Humana, last year. The insurance companies now say they need to integrate the delivery of care and pharmacy benefits into their own operations in order to tackle high medical costs. UnitedHealth, for example, has been acquiring doctors’ practices and surgery centers. Advertisement “We’re seeing a lot of vertical integration,” said Brian Marcotte, chief executive of the National Business Group on Health, which represents large employers. With insurers looking to operate their own pharmacy managers, “it seemed like this was the next logical shoe to drop.”  . Frustration over the rising costs of health care is mounting among employers — who insure most working Americans — and consumers, who are being asked to pay more out of pocket. In January, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway announced plans to team up to address spiraling health care costs. Berkshire’s founder, the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, described those costs as a “growing tapeworm on the American economy.” Adam J. Fein, chief executive of the Drug Channels Institute, which studies the drug industry, said the recent mergers may lead to better coordination because the companies will be looking at health care from multiple angles. “When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail,” he said. “If everything you are thinking about is pharmacy costs, everything looks like a drug pricing problem.” Some experts, though, see the combinations as potentially harmful. George Slover, senior policy counsel for Consumers Union, which also raised concerns about the Aetna-CVS merger, said in a statement that these deals “could result in restricted choices throughout the marketplace, ultimately leading to higher costs and potentially poorer coverage and care for consumers.” Craig Garthwaite, a health economist with Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, said that whether consumers ultimately benefit “will hinge entirely on the amount of competition in the health insurance market.” In recent years, the model of a pharmacy benefit manager has also come under scrutiny. The pharmaceutical industry, among others, argues that benefit managers are profiting from higher drug prices by keeping a percentage for themselves. The Trump administration made a similar argument in February, noting that the top three benefits managers controlled 85 percent of the market. On Wednesday, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, said in a speech that the situation had created “misaligned incentives,” as the discounts that manufacturers negotiate “may not always be passed along to employers or consumers.” Mr. Wentworth, the Express Scripts executive, said the company was “fully transparent about how the money flows and the contracts we do.” Follow Katie Thomas, Reed Abelson and Chad Bray on Twitter: @katie_thomas, @ReedAbelson and @Chadbray.

 Amazon said Tuesday that it had acquired Ring, a maker of internet-connected doorbells and cameras, pushing more deeply into the home security market. The deal is worth around $1.1 billion, according to a person briefed on the deal who would speak only anonymously because the terms were private. Ring is best known for a doorbell with a security camera inside. The device allows homeowners to monitor visitors at their front door through an app on their phone, even if they’re not at home. Amazon has made home automation a major focus because of the success of its Echo family of products, which allow users to control thermostats, surveillance cameras and other connected devices using voice commands. Amazon’s Echo Spot device already works with Ring doorbells, allowing people to look at footage from the cameras on the Echo Spot’s screen. Amazon had invested an undisclosed amount in Ring through its Alexa Fund, which finances start-ups that integrate their products with Alexa, the Amazon intelligent assistant that powers Echoes and other devices. Advertisement Buying Ring, though, suggests that Amazon has more ambitious plans for the product than it could achieve through a partnership. Advertisement Luke Schoenfelder, chief executive of Latch, a start-up that makes a family of smart locks, said he believed that Amazon would make a more serious effort to enter the home security market and compete against companies like ADT, Comcast and Alarm.com. Mr. Schoenfelder speculated that Amazon could seek to make home security part of its Prime membership service, which today includes free and fast delivery of orders and video streaming. “You could imagine some kind of bundled offering with Ring’s capabilities,” he said. ADT’s stock fell sharply after the deal became public on Tuesday afternoon. It ended the day down 4.6 percent. The companies declined to say much about their plans. “Ring’s home security products and services have delighted customers since Day 1,” Amazon said in a statement. “We’re excited to work with this talented team and help them in their mission to keep homes safe and secure.”  . Ring’s statement said: “We’ll be able to achieve even more by partnering with an inventive, customer-centric company like Amazon. We look forward to being a part of the Amazon team as we work toward our vision for safer neighborhoods.” Ring’s internet doorbells start at $179. People who want to use them to record video must pay for that capability, with plans starting at $3 a month or $30 a year. The company also makes stand-alone security cameras. Amazon has taken some baby steps into home security. Last year it began selling an indoor security camera of its own design, Amazon Cloud Cam, and in December it acquired Blink, a maker of inexpensive internet security cameras and doorbells. A service called Amazon Key uses cameras and internet-connected door locks to allow delivery people to drop orders inside customers’ homes. Google, one of Amazon’s biggest rivals, is also an increasingly important player in home automation and security, with its Nest thermostats and security cameras. James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said he believed that Amazon had bought Ring so it could add more intelligent capabilities to its doorbells and cameras, like the ability to use software to recognize faces at the front door. Advertisement “I think it’s about going to the next level and having Alexa say, ‘James, your fifth grader just walked in, and I locked the door behind them,’” he said. “It’s where these technologies have to go.” A version of this article appears in print on February 28, 2018, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Amazon Buys Ring, a Maker Of Smart Home Products.

 Judith Pearson’s home in rural Minnesota is stocked with guns for hunting and recreational use, but that didn’t stop her from venting her frustration with the National Rifle Association after the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla. Ms. Pearson, a retired school principal, was irked by the group’s repeated efforts to preserve civilian access to semiautomatic rifles, like the AR-15 the gunman used to kill 17 students and school staff members. “BoycottNRA,” she wrote to her handful of Twitter followers on the day of the attack, becoming one of the first participants in what became a sprawling campaign to force corporate America to dissociate itself from the gun lobby. Across the country, in Los Angeles, Laura Mannino had a similar thought. Drain the NRA, an advocacy group she co-founded in October after a deadly shooting in Las Vegas, developed a public spreadsheet of businesses associated with the gun group. After the attack in Florida, Ms. Mannino helped organize a rally against gun violence in downtown Los Angeles that drew hundreds of people. “Everyone started, in parallel ways, but in tandem, to go after these companies,” she said. Since the Parkland massacre, a range of people and coalitions have converged on the nationwide battleground over gun control. That includes individuals trying to make a statement, activist organizations sensing a shift in sentiment, informal parents’ clubs, marketing executives, niche media groups, celebrities and shooting survivors. Advertisement Through an uncoordinated but simpatico collection of Twitter hashtags, retweeted lists, Facebook groups, online petitions and carefully orchestrated campaigns, the protest has pushed a major bank, several car rental companies, two airlines and other businesses to publicly cut ties with the N.R.A. Advertisement On Monday night, the insurance broker Lockton Affinity was the latest to join a list of more than a dozen companies that includes the insurance provider MetLife, the cybersecurity firm Symantec, and the automobile pricing and information website TrueCar. Unlike hundreds of other boycotts that barely registered with consumers, the current effort has “taken on significant symbolic purpose” and speed, said Lawrence B. Glickman, a history professor and boycotts expert at Cornell University. “This wasn’t a concerted thing — it just took off and took on a life of its own,” Professor Glickman said. “It’s stunning — nothing like this has ever happened before with the N.R.A. as far as I know.” The #BoycottNRA hashtag, the unofficial unifier of the movement, was trending on Twitter on Friday and appeared more than 10,000 times in a single four-hour period on Monday, according to the analytics service ExportTweet. The hashtag has floated around social media since before the Sandy Hook massacre in late 2012, usually bubbling up after high-profile mass shootings only to quickly fade after failing to inspire much action. After the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida on Feb. 14, two dozen tweets mentioned the hashtag, followed by three dozen more the next day. But the calls for a boycott remained vague until last week, when lists of companies linked to the N.R.A. began tearing across social media. Posts from popular accounts were retweeted thousands of times. Advertisement ThinkProgress, a news website with a liberal bent, was among the first to spread the names, updating a list on Feb. 20 that it first published after the Sandy Hook shooting. It also published a report that the website for the N.R.A.’s official credit card was down. On Thursday, the First National Bank of Omaha, which issued the credit card, publicly confirmed its break from the N.R.A. “Then the floodgates were open,” said Judd Legum, who founded ThinkProgress. “Lots of people began moving very, very fast.” The pressure on companies to cut ties with the N.R.A. soon began sprouting up from various sources. Students who survived the Parkland shooting, who have become vocal proponents of gun control — and some of whom now have hundreds of thousands of social media followers — began pressuring specific companies to follow the bank’s lead. The massive asset manager BlackRock demanded information about the gun industry’s presence in investment portfolios. There were also calls for banks and payment processing companies to refuse firearms-related transactions.  . Facebook posts and petitions from parents in Brooklyn, hiking enthusiasts and bike shops urged consumers and retailers like REI not to support CamelBak hydration packs and Bell helmets. Those brands are owned by Vista Outdoor, which also makes guns and ammunition. Celebrities including Alyssa Milano and Denis O’Hare began backing a push to stop Amazon and other streaming sites from supporting the NRATV online video channel. Unaware of the Hollywood campaign, Brad Chase, a communications consultant who in the past has worked with some of the brands that distanced themselves from the N.R.A., staged his own protest against Amazon after seeing screen grabs of the N.R.A.’s content streaming on its platforms. He and a longtime friend, whose son survived the Parkland shooting, initiated a petition on Thursday that asked people to “flood Amazon’s Legal Department with calls.” The pair hoped for 5,000 signatures. By Tuesday afternoon, they had more than 200,000. “We know we’re not going to change this epidemic of gun violence overnight, but this is one of those things people can do right now while we wait for the slow wheels of government to take action,” Mr. Chase said. 
                When a gunman walked into a Florida school on Feb. 14, his rifle let him fire in much the same way that many American soldiers and Marines would fire M16 and M4 rifles in combat.             So far, Amazon has not issued any comment related to the N.R.A. Some companies have resisted calls to sever business relationships with the N.R.A. On Monday, FedEx said that while it disagreed with the N.R.A.’s policies on semiautomatic firearms, it would continue to offer discounts to the group’s members. Advertisement The N.R.A. itself has accused companies of “a shameful display of political and civic cowardice” and said that “in time, these brands will be replaced by others.” Since that statement on Saturday, the divisive debate has inspired some gun rights supporters to post about joining the N.R.A., using the hashtag #TweetYourNRAMembership. Many N.R.A. supporters have also vowed not to patronize the brands that ended relationships with the gun group. Still, the boycott effort — parts of it organic, parts of it carefully orchestrated — was an impressive show of force against the gun lobby. Shannon Watts, who founded the activist group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America after the Sandy Hook massacre, said her group had successfully persuaded hundreds of companies like Starbucks to block guns in their stores. The organization has more than 100,000 active volunteers it can quickly mobilize to create graphics, send email blasts and fan out over social media. But after Parkland, Moms Demand Action adopted hashtags that others had created and cheered on campaigns that others had organized. “The more the merrier — it’s been a cumulative effort of different groups within the same space, all putting pressure on the N.R.A.,” Ms. Watts said. “What this has shown is that it doesn’t have to be any one specific group or person — it’s more about the overall noise than any single hashtag.” Follow Tiffany Hsu on Twitter: @tiffkhsu.

 LONDON — Comcast may have found a way to disrupt Walt Disney Company’s plan to buy most of 21st Century Fox: topping Fox’s bid to buy the British satellite broadcaster Sky with its own $31 billion takeover offer. The bid, plans for which were announced on Tuesday, seizes upon 21st Century Fox’s difficulties buying the piece of Sky that it does not already own. British regulators have expressed repeated concerns about giving Rupert Murdoch and his family more control over the country’s media, stretching the approval process out over more than a year and forcing 21st Century Fox to offer more concessions. Comcast has said that buying Sky would help it expand in Europe, where the broadcaster has 23 million customers and owns rights to show the English Premier League and other professional soccer leagues. Disney, too, has been keen on expanding internationally, with the British company serving as an important part of its $52 billion plan to buy a significant portion of 21st Century Fox. Whoever prevails, it will shake up Disney’s plans. Either 21st Century Fox will have to pay more for Sky, or Disney will lose a valuable international property to Comcast. Advertisement In a statement, 21st Century Fox said that it “remains committed to its recommended cash offer for Sky,” which it made in 2016. Advertisement Disney, Comcast and others are rushing to strike major deals in a swiftly changing media landscape. AT&T has bid more than $85 billion to take over Time Warner, a proposed merger that the Justice Department is attempting to block. Consumers increasingly stream their movies and televisions shows over the internet. Upstart technology companies like Apple and Amazon nurture ambitions to rival Hollywood’s big studios. Online broadcasters are even increasingly bidding for the rights to show sports — long a major moneymaking business for traditional broadcasters and cable operators. The saga over Sky has been one of the most drawn out deal-making dramas in media. Mr. Murdoch, the 21st Century Fox executive chairman, has tried for years to take full control of the broadcaster, which he started in 1989. By owning the rest of Sky, 21st Century Fox would be better positioned to take on the likes of Netflix, Amazon and other streaming giants. In 2011, Mr. Murdoch was forced to withdraw a $12 billion offer for the rest of Sky as a firestorm erupted over phone hacking by the news media in Britain. The scandal eventually led to the closing of The News of the World, the first newspaper Mr. Murdoch acquired in Britain in the late 1960s. In December 2016, 21st Century Fox tried again, in an effort to expand its global reach and cement Mr. Murdoch’s legacy. The company agreed to buy the 61 percent of Sky that it does not own for about $16 billion. While the Office of Communications, or Ofcom, ruled in June that Mr. Murdoch and other company executives were “fit and proper” to hold broadcasting licenses in Britain, it also said that the deal warranted more scrutiny. In the regulator’s view, the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News had amounted to “significant corporate failures.” Then last month, Britain’s competition regulator provisionally rejected the deal, saying that it was “not in the public interest.” The regulator said it was concerned that the deal would give the Murdoch family “too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda.” It noted at the time that Murdoch-controlled outlets, which include the newspapers The Sun and The Times of London, were already consumed by nearly a third of Britain’s population. In hopes of winning over regulators, 21st Century Fox has offered to establish a “fully independent” editorial board for Sky News and to continue to fund the Sky News brand after the transaction for at least 10 years. Advertisement 21st Century Fox had hoped to complete the Sky deal before the Disney sale was finalized. But Comcast’s move just adds uncertainty to an already complicated process. Disney, which declined to comment on Comcast’s proposal, must now decide how much it cares about Sky. It is also not clear if Disney would want to end up being partners with Comcast, in the event that Comcast wins majority control of Sky and Disney ultimately has Fox’s 39 percent stake. While announcing the planned purchase of Fox’s entertainment assets in December, Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, singled out Sky as “a real crown jewel” in a television interview with Bloomberg. “We certainly would be looking forward to the opportunity to have Sky be part of our company,” he said.  . Comcast has circled 21st Century Fox in the past. Last year, the cable giant was in preliminary talks to buy the entertainment assets owned by 21st Century Fox, including the minority stake in Sky. Disney ultimately prevailed. At the very least, Comcast has most likely made it more expensive for 21st Century Fox to buy all of Sky. Under the terms of its proposed bid, Comcast said, it would pay 12.50 pounds, about $17.50, a share in cash. That would represent a premium of 13 percent over its closing price on Monday and is about 16 percent above 21st Century Fox’s current offer of £10.75. On Tuesday, shares of the British broadcaster jumped by nearly one-fifth. The stock surge suggested investors expected 21st Century Fox to back away or come back with an even better offer. Comcast shareholders seemed less pleased. The company’s stock price dropped more than 6 percent in midday trading, to about $37. Disney shares fell 4 percent, to about $105.50, and Fox shares declined 2.6 percent, to about $37.80. An influential media analyst, Craig Moffett, who follows Comcast for MoffettNathanson, wrote in a research note that the Sky offer had positive aspects, including offering Comcast’s entertainment unit, NBCUniversal, broader distribution in Europe. Still, “Comcast will have to twist themselves into knots to explain why satellite distribution won’t be just as obsolete in Europe as it already is in the U.S.,” Mr. Moffett said. “Perhaps worst of all, this morning’s bid doesn’t really put to rest the idea that they might still try a topping bid for Fox’s U.S. assets, including the rest of Sky” if the Justice Department ends up approving AT&T’s takeover of Time Warner. Advertisement “The notion that Comcast might make a topping bid for Fox has weighed heavily on Comcast shares,” he added. For either Comcast or Disney, Sky offers a platform for international expansion. Comcast said in a statement that about a quarter of its revenue would come from international operations should it seal a deal with Sky, up from 9 percent currently. In addition to its other businesses, Sky has also announced plans to start streaming services in Spain and Switzerland. “We look at Sky as a media company: Sky News, Sky Sports, Sky Movies,” Brian L. Roberts, Comcast’s chairman and chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts. “There’s tremendous presence in the content creation, not just the distribution.” In a research note on Tuesday, Polo Tang, a UBS analyst, said that Sky could be “strategically interesting” to a variety of bidders, given its content and its broadcast and streaming distribution network. It also recently retained the rights to the Premier League at a lower cost than analysts had expected. Mr. Tang said that the benign outcome of the Premier League auction potentially “gives Fox scope to raise its offers.” Comcast said it was seeking control of more than half of Sky’s shares with Tuesday’s offer but was ultimately interested in acquiring all of the British broadcaster. In a statement, Sky urged shareholders to take no action yet. The broadcaster added that its independent directors “are mindful of their fiduciary duties and their obligations under the U.K. Takeover Code.” Follow Chad Bray on Twitter: @Chadbray Brooks Barnes contributed reporting from Los Angeles.

 ATLANTA — Delta Air Lines, one of Georgia’s largest private-sector employers, is among the glossiest corporate jewels in the state, contributing billions of dollars a year to the economy. Its hundreds of daily flights in and out of Atlanta’s airport are the main reason Georgia’s capital can brag, with justification, that it is a truly international city. “Delta is the Atlanta international airport, and our airport is, you know, the fuel that generates our commercial community,” said Sam Massell, the city’s former mayor. But prestige, boosterism and corporate coddling — all cherished concepts in Georgia — took a back seat this week to the national debate over gun control. In the wake of the Florida school shooting, the airline announced it was ending a promotional discount with the National Rifle Association, and suddenly found itself in the rare position of being openly dressed down — and potentially punished — by Republicans who control the statehouse. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle of Georgia, a Republican who presides over the State Senate and has received an A-plus grade from the N.R.A., joined other conservative lawmakers this week in threatening to remove a $50 million sales tax exemption on jet fuel that some hoped would encourage Delta to open even more routes — and help Atlanta attract even more national and international companies. Advertisement The conservative backlash highlighted the challenge confronting corporations around the country that are struggling to cater to both ends of America’s increasingly distant political and cultural poles. Advertisement As pressure from social media and advocacy groups has intensified, and calls for boycotts mount, more than a dozen companies have severed business ties with the N.R.A. since the massacre in Parkland, Fla. Just as quickly, a counteroffensive arose from gun supporters excoriating the companies for their stance, forcing business leaders to navigate the treacherous ground where social responsibility, ideology and financial impact converge. Delta did not respond on Tuesday to Mr. Cagle’s threat or amplify its stance regarding the N.R.A. In a statement over the weekend, the company said its decision to stop offering discounted fares to the N.R.A. “reflects the airline’s neutral status in the current national debate over gun control amid recent school shootings.” As of Tuesday afternoon, the jet-fuel tax break, while opposed by Mr. Cagle and some other conservative Republicans, had not yet been stripped out of a broader Senate tax bill. Delta chose to end special discounts, but FedEx took a different approach, one that highlighted the delicate balancing act. In a statement Monday, FedEx said it disagreed with the N.R.A.’s stance on civilian access to assault rifles but would continue to offer discounts of up to 26 percent to the group’s members. “We are very clear that, when we set pricing strategy or look to adjust pricing, it is not based on political positions or points of view,” Patrick Fitzgerald, the company’s senior vice president, integrated marketing and communications, said in an interview on Tuesday. “But we do have a very clear corporate position in terms of gun safety and school safety.” In Georgia, the debate has been surprisingly fiery, even in a state long defined by tensions between the liberal metropolis and conservative countryside, and between the values of global corporate culture and those of Southern Republicans. “Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,” Mr. Cagle, a leading G.O.P. candidate for governor, wrote in a tweet Monday, in which he announced that he would “kill any tax legislation” that benefited Delta unless it changed its position. Advertisement State Senator Josh McKoon said in an interview Tuesday that he was put off by Delta’s assertion that it was trying to remain neutral on the guns issue, when it had taken positions on other social topics in the past. “It just came off as very disingenuous,” Mr. McKoon said of Delta’s statement. Referring to Mr. Cagle’s pushback, Mr. McKoon said, “I think he captured the sentiment and the feeling of a lot of Georgians,” who, he said, were frustrated “with Delta weighing in on an issue that has nothing to do with the topic of transportation, for sure.” But Mr. Massell, the former mayor who is president of the Buckhead Coalition, an influential Atlanta business and civic group, called the entire debate “embarrassing.” He said that he feared the threat against Delta would scare away Amazon, the online retail giant that has listed Atlanta among the finalists for its second headquarters.  . “I don’t believe in blackmail, and I’m sorry to use such a dirty word, but that’s almost what it tastes like,” said Mr. Massell, a Democrat who served as mayor from 1970 to 1974. “That’s terrible. That’s not Georgia’s image. That’s backwoods stuff that doesn’t belong at all.” The story of Delta and the story of Atlanta have been deeply intertwined for decades. The company was founded in Louisiana in the 1920s; it focused, in the earliest days, on crop dusting, in an effort to end the boll weevil infestation that had ruined many Southern cotton crops. The company moved to Atlanta in 1941. In subsequent decades, the city, which was founded as a railroad hub, invested heavily in its airport, and pushed a message that it was more socially tolerant than other Southern cities like Birmingham. It was a winning combination. Today, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the busiest in the world, and Delta employs more than 33,000 Georgia residents. 
                When a gunman walked into a Florida school on Feb. 14, his rifle let him fire in much the same way that many American soldiers and Marines would fire M16 and M4 rifles in combat.             Its current problem with the legislature has prompted leaders in other states to woo Delta via Twitter. “You know, in mathematics, Delta represents the change in something,” wrote Randall Woodfin, the mayor of Birmingham. He added, “Let’s chat.” Michael Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business and faculty director of the Center for Social Impact, said in an interview that “Delta has every right to tell legislators, ‘We’re not of a mind to do your bidding.’ They could easily pack their bags and move away from Atlanta and go to Dallas.” But it seemed unlikely that the airline would move. In 2016, the company signed an airport lease with the city that would keep its headquarters in Atlanta through 2036. Advertisement “Atlanta and Georgia and the business community usually try to work together and Delta is a huge employer in this state,” said another former Atlanta mayor, Shirley Franklin. “So the relationship is damaged, if nothing else.” A broader concern, shared by some liberals, conservatives and members of the Georgia business community, is that gun control may now join other hot-button cultural topics that may damage the state’s reputation among national and global corporations that do not adhere to the same conservative Southern values as the state legislature. In the last few years, the legislature has taken up a number of prominent bills that critics say would allow for discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Gov. Nathan Deal vetoed one of them, a so-called religious liberty bill, in 2016, after some of the state’s most prestigious and powerful companies — including Delta, Home Depot and Coca-Cola — openly opposed the measure. Mr. Deal, a Republican, will soon leave office because of term limits. Mr. Cagle, a leading candidate to replace him, is among a number of Republican hopefuls who say they will continue to support the legislation, which would have strengthened legal protection for opponents of same-sex marriage. Mr. McKoon, a Republican who is leaving the upper chamber to run for secretary of state, said that he had long opposed the jet-fuel tax break on the grounds that it seemed like a handout for a politically connected industry. Mr. McKoon was a vocal supporter of the 2016 religious liberty bill that Mr. Deal vetoed. He said that when that legislation failed, he issued a warning, saying that liberals would continue pressuring companies to embrace progressive social positions. He warned, he said, that “the next logical step would be to attack gun rights. And I think we are seeing the beginning of that.” An earlier version of this article, using information provided by a consulting firm working for Delta Air Lines, misstated the airline’s estimate of its economic impact on Georgia. It is $43.5 billion, not $435 billion.

T3,27-Feb-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin FEB. 27, 2018
 Happy Tuesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Comcast is fighting Fox over the British broadcaster Sky. • How will Powell discuss loose fiscal policy? • Delta shows pushing back against the N.R.A. has political costs. • Will the U.S. challenge Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm on national security grounds? Want this in your inbox? Sign up here. Comcast may have found a way to disrupt Walt Disney’s deal for a large part of 21st Century Fox: make a bid to buy the British satellite broadcaster Sky. The offer, writes Liam Proud of Breakingviews, leaves Fox with two unappealing options to save its deal with Disney. Rupert Murdoch can either “revise the terms of the Disney sale to exclude Sky, or enter into a bidding war with” Comcast. Advertisement Sky investors seem to be betting on the latter option. Its stock jumped nearly 20 percent and is now trading above Comcast’s offer. Advertisement The reason for that may be that “both Fox and Disney have reasons for wanting to possess all of Sky,” writes Chris Hughes of Bloomberg Gadfly. “Fox may want full ownership as an insurance policy against the sale to Disney failing. And Disney’s desire to buy Fox’s current stake in Sky suggests it likes the asset, wants more of it and would want to prevent Comcast owning it.” In fact, Robert Iger, Disney’s chief executive, has called Sky the crown jewel of his company’s purchase of Fox assets. Reaction • Frank Louthan, an analyst at Raymond James: “The potential for Fox to return and make a competing bid remains high, in our view, as our European investment team believes Sky is the best-in-class European leader in Pay-TV.” When is an offer an offer can be a fine point under Britain’s complicated takeover rules. On Tuesday, Comcast announced a “possible all-cash offer” to acquire Sky, the British satellite broadcaster, for about $31 billion . Sky and 21st Century Fox, which has been trying to acquire the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own for more than year, both responded that “no firm offer” had been made. That may seem like an odd distinction when Comcast, the owner of NBCUniversal, announced publicly how much it is willing to pay for an asset to kick off negotiations. But, that comes down to Britain’s extensive takeover code, which spans more than 400 pages, and can often trip up American companies not used to operating under those rules. The public disclosure of merger talks is triggered under the code when a number of factors occur, such as rumors in the market that a deal is in the works or “untoward movement” in a takeover target’s stock price. Advertisement Making a public announcement then starts a countdown clock for a potential acquirer to announce a formal offer under the rules, known as a so-called firm intention to make an offer. The rules are intended to make sure all shareholders are treated fairly and have access to the same information about a deal and to establish an orderly framework for takeovers. - Chad Bray We’d waited to see if Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chairman and C.E.O., would challenge Walt Disney for control of 21st Century Fox. Instead, he plans to disrupt Mr. Murdoch’s bid for full control of Sky, the British satellite broadcaster. What Comcast is offering: £12.50, or about $17.50, a share for all of Sky What Fox is offering: £10.75 a share for the 61 percent of Sky that it doesn’t own Behind the maneuvers Comcast had worked on its own offer for Fox, with the chance to expand internationally through Sky being a big reason for bidding. But the Murdochs and their advisers believed that it would be difficult for Comcast to win U.S. regulatory approval. However, Fox’s bid for Sky has been held up by questions by British regulators about whether Mr. Murdoch was fit and proper to control a major broadcaster in the U.K. That presented Comcast’s opportunity. What Mr. Roberts said in Comcast’s regulatory statement: “We already have a strong presence in London, and Comcast intends to use Sky as a platform for our growth in Europe.” Whom to thank for the Comcast bid 
            Someone needs to find this cabbie pic.twitter.com/lH4SFcggcp  Critics’ corner • Paul Richards of the media research firm Numis told the FT that Comcast’s bid is a “very strong competitive offer.” Advertisement • Alex DeGroote at Cenkos Securities told Bloomberg, “The market was anticipating another approach and will be pleasantly surprised.” Market reaction Comcast investors don’t seem pleasantly surprised. Shares of Comcast are down 5.2 percent. Sky’s stock popped nearly 20 percent and is now trading above Comcast’s offer. When Jerome H. Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday, we may see if he has mastered the art of stern but subtle disapproval. Congress has recently enacted tax cuts and spending increases that could stimulate the economy at a time when the Fed may want to tamp things down a bit. A tug of war could end up occurring between elected politicians wanting a boom to continue and a central bank that is concerned about government deficits and inflation. It is highly unlikely that Mr. Powell or any other Fed official would want to get drawn into a direct, public fight with members of Congress or the administration of President Donald Trump. So, how might Mr. Powell express concern about loose government fiscal policies? He can talk about Congress’s stimulus as just one of many factors that can have an impact on the Fed’s mission of creating the economic conditions for maximum employment and stable prices. In other words, he could depersonalize any tensions, and imply that concern about spending and deficits is just the Fed doing its job. And in his prepared testimony for the hearing, Mr. Powell noted the stimulus from fiscal policy. “In gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the F.O.M.C. will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing P.C.E. price inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis. While many factors shape the economic outlook, some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds: In particular, fiscal policy has become more stimulative and foreign demand for U.S. exports is on a firmer trajectory.” (F.O.M.C. is the Federal Open Market Committee, the committee that sets monetary policy, while P.C.E. price inflation is the Fed’s preferred measure of prices, derived from a survey of personal consumption expenditures conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.) Update from the hearing In this testimony before the House committee on Tuesday, Mr. Powell took some questions about the recent loosening of fiscal policy, and how the Fed might respond. Advertisement He followed the careful path outlined above. On the one hand, he noted that government finances can have an impact on economic conditions, saying: “Fiscal policy changes can have an effect.” He also said: “We really need to get on a sustainable fiscal path, and the time for doing that is now.” On the other hand, Mr. Powell said the Fed did not want to directly interfere in government spending decisions. “We don’t do fiscal policy at the Fed,” he said. — Peter Eavis That’s according to GeekWire and confirmed by CNBC.

Howard Schultz, the founder and executive chairman of Starbox, said during an interview with Fox Business that he is not running for president. Here’s the transcript via Dan Primack of Axios FBN’s Maria Bartiromo: Are you going to run for president in 2020, Howard? Schultz: “No I’m not... Ms. Bartiromo, then, followed up with: Bartiromo: “You are always seeing your position as a responsibility to bring people together. I know that, so just to clarify, you said you are not going to run for president? Schultz: “I said I am doing everything I possibly can as a private citizen to advance the cause of the country.” Bartiromo: “It sounds like you are running for president, Howard.” Schultz: “No I didn’t say that. Come on, Maria.” Mr. Schultz is one of a number of business executives and celebrities long speculated to be considering a run for president in 2020. The list has included Oprah Winfrey, Mark Cuban, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, Bob Iger of Disney and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. On other topics • Taxes: “We are robbing from the future of young people in America who ultimately are going to have to pay for a $21 trillion tax deficit,” Mr. Schultz said. • Real Estate: “Over the last few weeks, I have been in a number of U.S. cities and observed firsthand the abundance of empty storefronts across the country, in prime A1 locations. We are at a major inflection point as landlords across the country will be forced (sooner than later) to permanently lower rent rates to adjust to the ‘new norm,’” Mr. Schultz said. The tweet from Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle of Georgia, Delta’s home state, shows that it isn’t easy for companies to find a balance between those who want corporate America to push for more gun control and those who think conservatives are being unfairly maligned. Advertisement By eliminating discounted fares for N.R.A. members, the airline has stirred up Georgia Republican opposition to a lucrative tax break that had substantial support only days ago.  Also in that category: FedEx, which is keeping its discounts for N.R.A. members while expressing support for banning assault rifles for civilians. Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. .

More from Diane Bartz of Reuters: Part of the CFIUS’ current concern, which is echoed in Cornyn’s letter, could lie in the fact that Broadcom has failed to strike a deal with Qualcomm and has resorted to what is essentially a hostile takeover by putting forward a slate of six Broadcom nominees for Qualcomm’s 11-member board.

 NEW YORK —  Best Buy Co Inc has completed a five-year turnaround and is ready to compete with market leader Amazon.com Inc to prove U.S. retail is not a ""winner takes all"" situation, Chief Executive Hubert Joly told Reuters on Friday. Brick-and-mortar retailers like Best Buy have closed stores and some have gone out of business over the past few years in the face of online competition and the decline of American malls. The largest U.S. consumer electronics retailer is attracting customers again, Joly said in an interview. ""We have turned around the business, it's about where we go from here,"" he said. ""We have not only survived but thrived and I don’t believe this is a winner-takes-all market."" Advertisement For the last five years the Richfield, Minnesota-based retailer has invested in price-matching, faster delivery, improving the search function on its website and better customer service to draw in shoppers to its stores and website.    In the latest holiday quarter, Best Buy posted its best sales in a decade, boosted by a rebounding economy and stronger consumer confidence, and projected sales above Wall Street estimates. Advertisement The retailer's share price is up 271 percent over the past five years, closing at $73.82 on Friday. The S&P is up about 75 percent in that time.  . Best Buy's appliance and home theater business has benefited from the bankruptcy of competitors RadioShack and HH Gregg Inc and tumbling sales at Sears Holdings Corp, Joly said. Best Buy has about 15 percent of the U.S. consumer electronics market. Along with rival Amazon, the two retailers have about 25 percent market share, leaving room to grow, the executive said. The company is betting on new services under its In-Home Advisor and Total Tech Support programs, which offer tech help to shoppers in an effort to boost sales. It is also opening warehouses near urban markets to speed online delivery. Investments in employee pay and training and other initiatives have resulted in a drop in worker turnover to about 30 percent from 50 percent to 55 percent about three to five years ago. Store managers are also staying on the job much longer, he said.

 SAN FRANCISCO —  The Nasdaq blasted through a record high on Friday as traders looking to ride recent momentum piled into Microsoft, Netflix, Amazon.com and other high-performance technology names. The rise came alongside a broad rally in the market. The S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose sharply - up 1.5 percent - as February's jobs report assuaged fears of inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes. The gains came nine years to the day since the bull market began. Microsoft, Apple and Amazon each rose more than 1 percent and hit or closely approached all-time highs, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index surged 1.8 percent to its own record. Those stock moves helped push the Nasdaq Composite Index up 1.4 percent to 7,532 points, which is about a third of a percent higher than its previous all-time high on Jan 26. Advertisement The Nasdaq and the S&P 500, also up about 1.4 percent, were both helped by employment data that tempered fears of faster interest rate increases. Advertisement There was no major news specifically related to the tech sector driving its gains. Netflix jumped 3.6 percent, also hitting a record high and bringing the video streaming service's gain in the past year to 65 percent. ""You look at tech and think, 'What is the catalyst that's going to bring it down?' I don't see one in the short term, and that makes me confident as a trader to go into those stocks that have been the leaders,"" said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC.  . Technology stocks have been widely viewed in recent months as a ""crowded trade,"" a situation where most investors have the same opinion, increasing the potential for a volatile selloff if sentiment changes. For example, Bank of Montreal in January launched an exchange traded fund aiming to triple the return of 10 stocks, including the so-called FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix Inc and Google parent Alphabet. Large cap active fund managers recently trimmed their relative weight in technology stocks to 1.18 times the broader market, down from 1.23 last month, giving up to discretionary stocks its position as the most crowded sector, according to a recent report from Bank of America. The Nasdaq is up 9 percent year to date, compared to a 3 percent increase in S&P 500, which has yet to recover from a February selloff sparked by fears of higher interest rates.

 ___ US hiring surge last month pulls in flood of new workers WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers went on a hiring binge in February, adding 313,000 jobs, amid rising business confidence lifted by the Trump administration's tax cuts and a resilient global economy. The robust hiring, reported by the Labor Department on Friday, was the strongest in 1½ years. ___ US bull market, 2nd longest since WWII, turns 9 NEW YORK (AP) — The bull market turned nine Friday, extending a run that began in the depths of the Great Recession. On March 9, 2009, the S&P 500 hit a cycle low of 676.53 and has more than quadrupled since. If the market continues on this trend until August 21, it will be the longest bull market in post-World War II history. ___ US stocks soar on strong jobs report; inflation fears ease NEW YORK (AP) — On the ninth anniversary of the bull market, Wall Street gets just what it wanted from the latest jobs report, and stocks and bond yields move sharply higher. The government reported strong hiring, low unemployment, slower wage growth. The Nasdaq composite cruised to a record high as technology companies have more than recovered their losses from early February. ___ Does Cohn's exit mark end of Trump's Goldman era? WASHINGTON (AP) — Has President Donald Trump's romance with the Goldman Sachs crowd gone cold? Top economic adviser Gary Cohn is only the latest Goldman figure to head for the White House exits. His departure suggests the influence of the oh-so-establishment banking powerhouse has been overwhelmed by the more nationalistic voices in the West Wing. Cohn announced his resignation this week after an unsuccessful effort to block Trump from imposing sweeping new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

T1,9-Mar-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin MARCH 9, 2018
 Good Friday. Here’s what we’re watching today: • Is Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, planning on stepping down? • The list of those hoping Broadcom fails in its pursuit of Qualcomm keeps growing. • When will wage growth pick up? • Senator Elizabeth Warren has some questions for Apollo and Citi. • How much is Martin Shkreli’s Wu-Tang album worth? • The Trump tariffs have many exceptions. . Don’t already get this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here. Advertisement The Wall Street Journal reported that Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, will step down “as soon as the end of the year,” citing anonymous sources. Advertisement But some important context is necessary: Neither Mr. Blankfein nor the board has set a timeline for him to step down, people briefed on the matter said. Mr. Blankfein has not discussed the possibility of leaving at the end of the year, these people said, though there is a general view that he likely would retire in the next couple of years. And it is very possible that this story may force Mr. Blankfein to move faster to explicitly lay out a timeline than he had originally planned. Is it possible that Mr. Blankfein would step down at the end of 2018? Sure. It is absolutely a possibility, these people said. But it is hardly a certainty. And it is also a possibility that he could step down as C.E.O. but remain chairman, the people said. Is it possible that he could still be at Goldman for part or all of 2019? Sure, these people said. But that’s not a certainty either. Is it possible he is at Goldman in 2020?  That’s less likely, these people agree. Goldman’s board has held discussions about who should succeed Mr. Blankfein ever since Gary Cohn left the firm at the end of 2016, these people said. The board has designated Harvey Schwartz and David Solomon as likely successors, but has not set a specific date for when they need to decide on who will take the reins, these people said. Both men have privately been making plans to take over, these people said. — Andrew Ross Sorkin Here’s Mr. Blankfein’s response to the WSJ story: 
            It's the @WSJ's announcement...not mine. I feel like Huck Finn listening to his own eulogy.         The order President Trump signed on Thursday imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum provided him with wiggle room to exempt countries down the road. In fact, even before signing the order, he suggested the possibility of later excluding allies like Australia. Well, that seems like more of possibility now. Late Friday President Trump said he is working with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on an agreement so Australia will not be subject to the tariffs. 
            Spoke to PM @TurnbullMalcolm of Australia. He is committed to having a very fair and reciprocal military and trade relationship. Working very quickly on a security agreement so we don’t have to impose steel or aluminum tariffs on our ally, the great nation of Australia!         The Wall Street Journal reports that Intel “is considering a range of acquisition alternatives in reaction to Broadcom’s hostile pursuit for Qualcomm.” Advertisement Those options include a possible bid for Broadcom, the WSJ reports citing anonymous sources. Shares of Broadcom jumped 5 percent after hours. Details from the WSJ • Intel is worried about the competitive threat a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm would pose. • Intel has been weighing its options since late last year and has engaged advisers. • Intel might make a bid if Broadcom looks likely to succeed in its pursuit of Qualcomm. Caveats • Any move from Intel is far from certain and one of WSJ’s sources said it is unlikely. Context Washington isn’t so sure a merger of Broadcom and Qualcomm is a good idea. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government panel that reviews transactions’ national security implications, moved to stall the potential takeover of Qualcomm The panel’s intervention put Broadcom’s bid in jeopardy. In practice, reviews by Cfius often lead to the demise of deals. MARCH 9, 2018
 The February jobs report is in. The number of jobs added was the strongest in two years, but wage growth remained lackluster. Advertisement Here are the numbers: • 313,000 jobs were added last month, the most since October 2015. Economists had anticipated a gain of about 200,000. • With revisions to previous months, the three-month average job growth was 242,000 a month. • The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent, the same as in January. • The average hourly wage grew by 0.1 percent. It grew by 0.3 percent in January. The year-over-year increase fell to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent. • The labor force grew by 806,000, pushing the labor force participation rate back up to the 63 percent mark. MARCH 9, 2018
 Context A leap in job gains in February clears the way for the Federal Reserve to raise the benchmark interest rate when it meets this month. The wage figures were disappointing. The jump in hourly earnings in January — which pushed the year-over-year figure to 2.9 percent, from 2.3 percent just three months earlier — was cited as a cause of a market sell-off. With February’s puny growth of 0.1 percent, the year-over-year increase dropped to 2.6 percent. MARCH 9, 2018
 Investors could not have asked for much more from Friday’s jobs report. The numbers for February show the United States economy was able to add a surprisingly large number of new jobs without creating the sort of surge in wages that can prompt investors to worry about inflation. The 10-year Treasury note, which might have sold off on inflation fears, barely budged when the report came out. Futures markets pointed to higher opens for stock markets. Advertisement The economy created 313,000 jobs in February, the most since October 2015. Wages rose 2.6 percent from a year earlier, below the 2.9 percent rate for January that stoked inflation concerns. In theory, as employers add large numbers of new employees, the competition to hire workers should drive wages much higher. Why is that not happening right now? It seems a large number of people who previously weren’t looking for jobs are now entering the work force. That, in part, explains the 800,000 person increase in the labor force. 
            Monster household survey this month: 800k gain in labor force, participation rate and employment-population ratio both up 0.3 percentage points.         But investors will no doubt find something to fret about. Some may decide that the growth in employment is so strong that it won’t be long before wage pressures build up. The amount of slack in the labor force is unknown, so investors shouldn’t rely on it to dampen wage growth indefinitely, according to this view. — Peter Eavis It’s the unknown that torments investors every time the jobs report comes out. Maybe we can shed some light. As Friday’s jobs report showed, the economy is adding large a numbers of jobs without stoking the sort of surge in wages that makes investors worried about inflation. Investors favor these economic conditions because it reduces the chances that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates more quickly than they expect. But how long might wage growth remain moderate? Much depends on how much slack exists in the jobs market. The headline unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, suggests there is very little. But the unemployment rate does not count the people who aren't in the workforce – and who may now enter it. No one knows for sure how many of these people are really looking for a job at any one time, or might do so in the near future. But if there are a lot of them, companies will not struggle to find workers — and wage growth might remain tame. Conversely, if the number of prospective workers on the sideline is small, wage pressures could soon build up. One way to get an idea of the size of this group of people is to look at the employment rate, which measures people with jobs as a percentage of the population (over 16 years old and excluding prisoners.) At 60.4 percent in February, that rate is still well below the level it was at before the 2008 financial crisis. That would imply that there are still a lot of people who could enter the jobs market. Advertisement But our colleague Ben Casselman, who covers economics, has devised an adjusted employment rate that readers might find interesting. How did you adjust the measurement of the employment rate – and why did you make your tweaks? Let me start with the “why?” The employment rate is great in that it avoids all the issues that bedevil the unemployment rate in terms of deciding who should “count” as unemployed. But the problem is that it’s too broad. It includes a huge group of people who no one would expect to work, namely retirees. And that group is growing rapidly because baby boomers are aging. So if we want the employment rate to tell us anything meaningful about the state of the economy, we have to account for that big demographic trend in some way. One easy way to do this is to look at the employment rate among so-called “prime-age” workers, those ages 25 to 54. That excludes both retirees and most college students, which means it filters out a lot of the demographic noise in the employment rate. The problem is, it filters out a lot of valuable information, too. Lots of 55-year-olds work! And indeed, 55-year-olds are much more likely to work now than they were a generation ago. My calculation, which borrows from an approach used by economists (and occasional Upshot contributor) Ernie Tedeschi, adjusts for demographic shifts by controlling for age and sex. It essentially asks, “What would the employment rate look like today if the U.S. population still had the same demographic profile as it did before the recession?” What does your adjusted employment rate tell us about the jobs market right now? By my calculation, the demographics-adjusted employment rate was at 62.8 percent in February, which is almost exactly where it stood in December 2007, which was the first month of the recession. But it’s still significantly below where we were in 2000, the last time the unemployment rate got this low. Can we use your adjusted employment rate to get an idea of how much slack is left in the labor force? Yes, but it doesn’t give a definitive answer. What it tells us is that the employment rate has fully recovered from the recession. It doesn’t necessarily mean that all the slack is gone. Let me expand on that slightly. Between the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the peak of the housing bubble in 2007, the age-adjusted employment rate fell by about a percentage point. There are two reads on that. One is that the job market just never got as good in the mid-2000s as it did in 1999 and 2000. The other interpretation is that there has been a fundamental shift in the economy, and for some set of reasons — technology, globalization, video games — the share of Americans who are willing or able to work has fallen. Advertisement If you buy that second story, then the fact that the age-adjusted employment rate is back to prerecession levels should tell you that we’re basically at full-employment today. The slack is gone. This is as good as it gets. But I would argue the last couple years should lead to significant skepticism about this kind of structural-change thesis. The labor force has grown dramatically over the last few years. Job growth has continued unabated. Unemployment rates for marginalized groups such as black Americans have fallen sharply. And this has all happened in an environment where wage growth has been sluggish, which suggests that employers are able to attract workers without boosting pay, at least by much. All of that suggests that there are still people out there who are willing to work if opportunities become available. I don’t know if we can get back to that 2000 employment level, but today’s report suggests we can at least keep moving in that direction. • Joseph Song and Michelle Meyer, BofA Merrill Lynch: Today’s “Goldilocks” report suggests the business cycle still has another leg to go: the labor supply is increasing to meet the gain aggregate demand, preventing price pressures from building too aggressively. • Ellen Zentner, Morgan Stanley: Straight lines don’t exist in economics. Despite the move lower in the year-over-year pace of average hourly earnings (AHE), the underlying trend in wage growth continues to firm, in line with continued tightening in the labor market and rising productivity. • Joe Brusuelas, RSM US: “The job market continues to sizzle as the economy is in the early stages of absorbing a late cycle fiscal boost that will support a growth rate well above the long-term trend in 2018. The 313,000 job gain is more than triple that necessary to meet the demand of new entrants into the work force, which if it sustained will continue to put downward pressure on the unemployment rate. This will not be lost among an F.O.M.C. that leans hawkish in 2018 and points toward an increasing probability that the central bank will hike rates four times this year. How strong is this labor market? The increase of 806,000 in the labor force and 785,000 in the household employment estimate are robust and statistically significant, which is a rare two-for in the monthly labor report. This labor market is on fire and wage gains are in train.” • James Ingram, MB Capital: “February’s fall in average wage rise data takes some of the pressure off. But the creation of more than 300,000 jobs in February suggests it will return in the months to come. Throw in a potential trade war between the US and the EU and the US economy could be headed for a perfect inflationary storm later this year. An interest rate hike in March from the US Fed must now be all but nailed on.” Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . • Capital Economics: “We suspected that the flu epidemic and the unseasonably cold weather in January had depressed payrolls, but even we were caught out by the strength. Illness and weather also affected the earnings and hours worked data in January, with those effects unwinding in February.” Specifically, Ms. Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, is interested in the loans Apollo and Citigroup extended to Jared Kushner’s family real estate firm, reports Politico’s Playbook. Ms. Warren, along with Representative Elijah Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, Senator Tom Carper, Democrat of Delaware, and Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, sent letters to Apollo (the letter) and Citigroup (the letter) asking: “For the dates the loans were offered, conditions of the loan and a description of the process by which the Kushner Companies got the loans. It asks for ALL MEETINGS between the two firms and Kushner, and various details about those meetings. They request ALL DOCUMENTS from the loan process and whether any of the loans included foreign financing.” Context The New York Times reported last week that:  • Josh Harris, a founder of Apollo Global Management, was advising Trump administration on infrastructure policy last year and met with Mr. Kushner several times. Among other things, the two men discussed a possible White House job for Mr. Harris, which never materialized. In November, Apollo lent $184 million to Kushner Companies. The loan was to refinance the mortgage on a Chicago skyscraper Advertisement • Michael Corbat, Citigroup’s C.E.O., met with Mr. Kushner in the spring, and shortly afterward the bank lent Kushner Companies $325 million. Stephanie Clifford of the NYT reported: Martin Shkreli, a former pharmaceutical executive notorious for sharply increasing drug prices, mounting sneering defenses of his actions and even issuing a bounty for one of Hillary Clinton’s hairs, was sentenced on Friday to seven years in prison after being convicted of fraud last year. Last summer, a jury convicted Mr. Shkreli, nicknamed Pharma Bro, on three of eight counts , concluding that he had lied to investors about, among other things, how the hedge funds were managed, what they invested in and how much money they had. The jury found that he had also secretly controlled a huge number of Retrophin shares. Prosecutors had sought a sentence of at least 15 years; the defense had pushed for 12 to 18 months. Ben Sisario of the NYT writes: When Martin Shkreli, the disgraced former pharmaceuticals executive, is sentenced for securities fraud in Brooklyn on Friday, the government will have its pick of a number of his assets to satisfy the $7.36 million judgmentagainst him. There is a brokerage account with $5 million in cash, shares in his company Vyera Pharmaceuticals, even a Picasso. And then there is an item that has been the subject of worldwide intrigue: the sole copy of the Wu-Tang Clan album “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin,”packaged in a custom silver-and-nickel case and accompanied by a 174-page leather-bound book. It may be the most famous album ever kept in the possession of just one person. But what is it worth? The answer? It is complicated, though experts all doubt that the album could yield anywhere near the $2 million Mr. Shkreli apparently paid for the album at auction three years ago. President Trump authorized tariffs on imported steel and aluminum yesterday, defying allies and Republicans alike. But as Peter Eavis notes, the presence of exemptions for Canada and Mexico show more wiggle room than expected: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has leeway to exempt certain steel and aluminum imports from the restrictions if he determines that the United States lacks the capacity to produce them. There is also a national security exemption, notable since national security concerns are the legal basis for the tariffs. And Neil Irwin of the Upshot reckons that while we’re seeing a trade skirmish, it won’t necessarily become a trade war. (He also thinks it’s partly a negotiating tactic in the Nafta talks.) That hasn’t stopped trade partners  protesting. And in its lead editorial, The Economist wrote, “Not since its inception at the end of the second world war has the global trading system faced such danger.” The other China trade story: Mr. Trump tweeted that he has asked Beijing to reduce its trade deficit with the U.S. by $1 billion, adding, “We must act soon!” Elon Musk subsequently beseeched him on Twitter to tackle China’s restrictions on auto imports.

(Politico) Behind Cigna’s $67 billion (with debt) acquisition of Express Scripts is the idea that health insurance on its own is a challenged business. The C.E.O.s of the two companies said the union would help lower costs. But it’s also meant to help Cigna counter both UnitedHealth, the giant of the industry, and a combined CVS and Aetna. There’s skepticism: Cigna’s shares fell 11 percent yesterday. Matthew Borsch of BMO Capital Markets said that investors had hoped the insurer would buy something other than a business “under pressure, under scrutiny and to some degree in decline.” About that pressure: The F.D.A. has shown interest in lack of competition among drug benefits managers. David Balto, an antitrust expert, told the NYT, “History has shown where there are multiple mergers going on in a single industry, the Justice Department goes on high alert.” Advertisement Critics’ corner: Charley Grant of Heard on the Street writes, “Cigna has increased its vulnerability to industry changes rather than reduced it.” And Lex says of Express Scripts’ industry, “Like Seth Rogen comedies, they are a U.S. institution whose utility eludes other nations.” The deals flyaround • Toys “R” Us, yet to find a buyer, is preparing to liquidate its U.S. operations, unnamed sources say.

The Obamas already signed book deals reportedly worth $60 million. • While Mr. Obama doesn’t intend to take on his successor directly, will his likely choice of topics — like health care, immigration, voting rights — be seen as a counter to President Trump anyway?

T1,20-Feb-18,"Advertisement By MICHAEL CORKERY and CHAD BRAYFEB. 20, 2018
 The supermarket operator Albertsons said Tuesday morning that it would buy the remnants of the Rite Aid drugstore chain. By the end of the day, Walmart saw its stock drop by more than 10 percent on weak profit. Both can blame Amazon. An old-line grocer, Albertsons is striving for reinvigoration in a retail landscape being upended by e-commerce competitors and discount food stores. But it can be difficult for any company, no matter how strategic its deal-making, to pull off a revival in this environment. The retail stalwart, Walmart has been trying to build its online presence as it moves to fend off Amazon. But even deep pockets don’t guarantee success in an increasingly digital landscape. Amazon is the omnipresent foe, in whatever realm that Albertsons or Walmart plays in. The e-commerce giant wants to dominate the grocery store business, while also eyeing the health care industry. Advertisement “It’s the battle of the old generation versus the new generation,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. “And right now the companies that are gaining share is the new generation.” Advertisement The deal for Rite Aid puts Albertsons directly in the middle of two major pushes by Amazon. Albertsons plans to rebrand its in-house pharmacies under the Rite Aid name, and to continue operating some stand-alone Rite Aid stores. The bet is that the increased foot traffic to the in-house pharmacies will bring more customers to Albertsons’ food aisles, where they will pick up a rib-eye steak or a bunch of bananas on their way out. Last year, Amazon moved aggressively to extend its e-commerce edge to groceries, acquiring Whole Foods for $13.4 billion in a deal that greatly enhanced its ability to deliver fresh food to millions of American households. Amazon’s entry into the grocery business could hurt Albertsons and similar chains whose greatest asset may be the convenient locations of their stores. If Amazon increases its home delivery of fresh food, that convenience may not be as appealing. Conventional grocers like Albertsons are also feeling pressure from chains like Trader Joe’s, which is known for its affordable high-quality products, and Wegmans, a growing regional chain that has built a cultlike following. “Grocery is being hit by multiple factors,” said Gerald Storch, the former chief executive of the retailer Hudson’s Bay. The pharmacy business, too, is undergoing major changes, with the nation’s largest operators of drugstores pursuing mergers to control costs and increase profits.  . In December, the drugstore giant CVS Health said it would merge with the health insurer Aetna in a $69 billion deal that could reshape the way health care is delivered in the United States. That deal came together after a federal judge blocked Aetna’s proposed merger with rival Humana last year. Rite Aid had previously sought to bulk up by merging with Walgreens. Negotiations between two of the biggest drugstore chains in the United States ended after antitrust authorities indicated they were unlikely to approve the combination. Instead, Rite Aid agreed last year to sell 1,932 stores and three distribution centers to Walgreens for $4.38 billion. Advertisement Amazon’s specter also looms over the health care field. The company recently teamed up with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase to form an independent health care company to serve the three firms’ employees and potentially revamp the broader industry. For Albertsons, the Rite Aid deal is just the latest step to draw in more customers. In November, the company reached an agreement with Instacart to provide on-demand grocery-delivery services. It also invested last year in El Rancho Supermercado, a Texas-based retailer focused on stores for Latino customers. Originally founded by Joe Albertson in Boise, Idaho, in 1939, Albertsons grew primarily across the West. In 2013, it was acquired by a group of investors led by the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management for about $3 billion. Its biggest deal came in 2014 when Cerberus agreed to buy Safeway, another grocery chain whose roots lie in Idaho, for $9.2 billion. A planned public offering of the company’s stock in 2015 never took place. The Rite Aid deal provides Albertsons’ investors with a way of finally going public after investing billions of dollars. Under the deal’s terms, Rite Aid shareholders would get $1.83 in cash and one share of Albertsons stock, or 1.079 shares of Albertsons stock, for every 10 shares of Rite Aid they owned. Walmart’s biggest challenges are tied to its own plans to compete with Amazon. Walmart spent heavily acquiring online retailers like Bonobos, Jet.com and ModCloth. Investors have largely been willing to forgive the company’s softening profits as long as the investments resulted in increased sales. But Wall Street is getting impatient. In announcing the fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, Walmart said its online sales had grown 23 percent in the United States during the three-month period that ended Jan. 31. That was less than half the rate of growth in each of the previous three quarters. “Walmart got a late start to the internet game, and they are still suffering for it,” said Mr. Johnson, of Customer Growth Partners.

 Walmart has been making big investments in its online business as it tries to adapt to the shifting preferences of global shoppers and to keep pace with its rival Amazon. But Walmart’s online sales growth hit a speed bump in the company’s fiscal fourth quarter, which included the critical holiday shopping season. Online sales grew 23 percent in the United States during that three-month period, the company reported on Tuesday, less than half the rate of growth in each of the previous three quarters. Walmart’s chief executive, Doug McMillon, said “operational challenges” at the company’s fulfillment centers during the holidays were responsible for some of the slowdown. Walmart said that a large influx of electronics, toys and other seasonal items had made it difficult to fulfill sales of everyday products. Advertisement The slowdown reflects a broader challenge at Walmart, which has dominated the retail industry for decades with its extensive store network but is now playing catch-up in the e-commerce realm with Amazon, which captures half of all online spending. Advertisement “We are building a business,” Mr. McMillon said on a call with analysts on Tuesday. “We are learning something new.” Despite the slower pace of online growth, Walmart’s total sales increased 4.1 percent, to $136.3 billion, during the quarter, which ended Jan. 31. That was not enough to impress Wall Street. Walmart shares dropped nearly 9 percent in early morning trading. On a per-share basis, Walmart earned $1.33 in the fourth quarter, short of the $1.37 that analysts had expected. Operating income fell 28 percent, to $4.5 billion. Walmart has expanded its e-commerce offerings by purchasing Jet.com and the online clothing retailers Bonobos and Modcloth. Analysts have nonetheless questioned how Walmart plans to integrate the acquisitions into a cohesive online retail strategy.  . On Tuesday, the company said it would focus its broad push for new customers on Walmart.com and not Jet, a less-recognizable brand tailored to more urban, higher-income customers. Walmart spent $3.3 billion to acquire Jet in 2016. At the time, it was the largest deal ever for an e-commerce company, although it was not clear how the two brands would mesh. “Jet will go through adjustment, but it will grow again,” Mr. McMillon said on Tuesday. Walmart’s lagging growth online was not entirely unexpected given that the Jet acquisition was responsible for the large growth rates of previous quarters. But Mr. McMillon acknowledged that the fourth-quarter slowdown “was a bit more than we planned.” Advertisement To increase growth again — Walmart said it expected online sales to rise 40 percent over the next year — the company is accelerating its web-based grocery business, increasing the number of stores where customers can order food online and pick it up in stores. Walmart is also experimenting with home delivery in the United States and in Asia, where it recently signed a partnership with the Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten to deliver groceries. Still, finding ways to integrate Walmart’s stores with its e-commerce strategy is costly. Last week, Walmart announced that it would offer members of its Sam’s Club unit free shipping of online orders for an annual fee of $100. As part of that effort, Walmart said it would convert a Sam’s Club store in Memphis into an e-commerce distribution center and planned to open more such centers elsewhere in the United States in the coming year. The company closed a total of 63 Sam’s Club stores during the fourth quarter, affecting more than 9,000 workers. Walmart said that it would try to find new positions for as many of the employees as possible, but that some would probably end up out of work. The restructuring at Sam’s Club was among the factors that drove profits down for the quarter. Even without the restructuring and other one-time charges, the company said, operating income would have fallen for the quarter. We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

 PHILADELPHIA — On the west side of this city’s main Amtrak station sits an empty lot. But soon, it will be transformed into a public park filled with lawns, walkways and even redwood trees, in the first stage of one of Philadelphia’s biggest real estate projects. The 1.3-acre park, to be known as Drexel Square, kicks off a 20-year, $3.5 billion development that aims to create a hub for technology and life-sciences companies called Schuylkill (pronounced SKOO-kul) Yards. Not only will the project fill in an underused section of real estate, it is also intended to develop business opportunities for research coming out of Drexel University and the University of Pennsylvania, both just a few blocks away. The developer of Schuylkill Yards, named after the river that separates it from Philadelphia’s central business district, plans to convert 14 acres occupied by parking lots and older buildings on land adjacent to the rail yards into an innovation community. It will eventually include seven million square feet of office, laboratory, retail and residential space within walking distance of downtown businesses, attributes that may be attractive to Amazon, which has named Philadelphia as one of 20 finalists in its search for a second headquarters. The project, announced in 2016, hopes to attract an additional $4.5 billion in private investment from companies that seek proximity to the intellectual capital of the universities. Other benefits include access to Philadelphia’s growing population of skilled millennial workers as well as rail links to the suburbs and the northeastern cities beyond from Amtrak’s 30th Street Station, the nation’s third-busiest passenger rail hub, after Pennsylvania Station in New York and Union Station in Washington. Advertisement The development will include 2.8 million square feet of office space, 1.6 million square feet of apartments, one million square feet of lab space and more than 100,000 square feet of retail in buildings that will combine new and refurbished construction. Much of the land is owned by Drexel, whose main campus abuts the site. The university has leased the ground to the developer, Brandywine Realty Trust. Its scale and location will give further impetus to the University City district, a neighborhood in West Philadelphia that houses a complex of academic and research institutions, including Drexel, Penn and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Recent investment in research facilities and student housing in the district has already created one of the fastest-growing areas of the city, said Brandywine’s chief executive, Gerard H. Sweeney. Advertisement “Our hope was that we could connect the city, eliminating the river as a historic dividing point,” Mr. Sweeney said. “We hope Schuylkill Yards is going to move the physical perception of the city west.” The park is a linchpin of the project, Mr. Sweeney said, because the overall intent is to create a livable neighborhood that will attract an educated work force, one that increasingly demands walkable access to offices, shops and homes in a dense urban environment. “Some people think you put a big tall building here right outside the train station,” Mr. Sweeney said during a visit to the park construction site. “But you’ve got to create a platform for excellence, and the way you do that is you invest in public space. You create a place where people want to be.” The first tenant will be Spark Therapeutics, a five-year-old gene therapy company that has adapted expertise developed at University City’s rich intellectual resources. John Fry, president of Drexel, called Spark’s participation “a major win” for Schuylkill Yards. “Having Spark as our first tenant signals to everyone that we are going to favor life-sciences companies and high-tech companies,” Mr. Fry said. He added that Spark planned to move into the first renovated building in the new complex in 2018. Advertisement Mr. Fry said the project differed from innovation districts in other cities by combining the resources of a major university with a major developer. But the real draw was its proximity to a deep talent pool at Drexel, Penn and the University City Science Center, a nonprofit organization that provides resources to entrepreneurs. Every week, get updates on residential real estate news, covering the five boroughs and beyond. . “There’s an aggregation of talent in the fastest-growing employment center in the city, and Schuylkill Yards is right in the middle of that,” Mr. Fry said. Bruce J. Katz, a scholar at the Brookings Institution who has studied the development of University City, agreed that the project’s proximity to transportation and top research facilities in the heart of a major city was an unusual combination that was likely to attract the significant investment sought by the developer. “This is an unparalleled opportunity, and very distinct from other innovation hubs,” Mr. Katz said. Many cities have research institutions that are miles from downtown, but Philadelphia has them within walking distance, he said. Because of that, the development project is well positioned to create a nexus of research and commerce that will become a major growth engine for the local economy. “This parcel is going to be an enormous catalyst for broader-scale regeneration,” Mr. Katz said. He said the attributes of Schuylkill Yards could also be attractive to Amazon, the Seattle-based behemoth. The development would fulfill many of Amazon’s requirements for a second headquarters, including access to transportation, availability of skilled workers and an urban location, Mr. Katz said. But even if Amazon does not choose Schuylkill Yards or two other Philadelphia sites that the city has proposed, the new development is well placed to meet the demands of the businesses that it seeks, he said. “What the innovation economy wants is this kind of proximity and density, and Philadelphia is giving it to them, and now they are leveraging it,” Mr. Katz said. “This whole area where Schuylkill Yards is going to be located is really the platform for that innovative economy.” Advertisement An influx of new workers in West Philadelphia would help strengthen the city’s economy. But some critics say it could also drive up real estate prices in adjoining low-income neighborhoods, which have already suffered from gentrification because of demand for housing from college students. Hoping to address those concerns, Brandywine has agreed to help fund affordable housing in local communities, and it is linking local businesses with existing vendors in an attempt to create jobs, Mr. Sweeney said. In addition, the developer has started an apprenticeship program for local people, who will be invited to take courses to meet trade union standards so they can become eligible for employment by Brandywine. Brandywine will provide $5.6 million to community organizations in the first phase of the development, a spokeswoman said. The outreach will also include support for education, housing preservation and minority business development. One of the groups, the Mount Vernon Manor Community Development Corporation, expects to share $3.1 million of the total, said its executive director, Michael Thorpe. Sixty percent of the money will be spent on affordable housing in a neighborhood where housing is already under pressure from the nearby student population. “We’ve been seeing a great deal of pressure for market-rate development, not for affordability,” Mr. Thorpe said. “People could be potentially pushed out if we don’t create a program to offset some of that stress.” Mr. Sweeney said he hoped that the development’s benefits would spread broadly to a city that for decades was seen by outsiders, and by some of its own people, as an inferior location. “We were losing population, we weren’t growing jobs, we weren’t attracting young people,” he said. “When you look at the attributes that a company should look for to cement its growth for the next 50 years, it’s right here.” A version of this article appears in print on February 21, 2018, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Philadelphia’s First Step to a Platform of Innovation.

 Good Tuesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Judge deals AT&T a setback in fight with Justice Department • Billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen lost a bid to seal a sex discrimination lawsuit against his investment firm. • Corporate leaders are discussing whether the finance industry can help regulate gun sales. • Walmart’s fourth-quarter earnings missed expectations. • Facebook is still facing blowback for an executive’s tweets about Russian electoral meddling. • Qualcomm’s revised bid for NXP raises questions about Broadcom’s pursuit of the company. Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. The telecom company had asked for internal communications between the White House and the Justice Department regarding AT&T’s $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner. Advertisement On Tuesday, a judge ruled that AT&T was not entitled to those documents, saying the companies had not “made a credible showing that they have been especially singled out.” Advertisement AT&T has argued that the Justice Department has unfairly singled out its proposed merger with Time Warner partly to stay in favor with the White House. President Trump has been a vocal critic of Time Warner’s news network, CNN, and said before the election that the deal should be stopped. The bigger picture Cecilia Kang of the NYT:  The decision puts a crimp in AT&T’s defense for its $85 billion proposed merger with Time Warner. And it is a big win for the Justice Department, which would like to avoid attention on the role of politics in its decision to stop the deal. The merger would transform the media landscape by combining a television and movie giant with one of the nation’s biggest media distributors. The trial is set to begin on March 19. For the first time, and after much protest, public companies must report their employees’ median pay and compare it with that of the chief executive. The Dodd-Frank Act, passed nearly eight years ago, required the disclosure, and firms are now disclosing it in proxy reports for 2017. Companies, lobbyists and some compensation experts spent years criticizing the rule, arguing that it revealed little about pay trends and was of little use to shareholders. The Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal-leaning think tank, on Tuesday noted that Honeywell was the first United States corporation to release the ratio. The company’s C.E.O., Darius Adamczyk, had a total pay package of $16.8 million in 2017, which was 333 times the pay of the median employee. The rule allows certain companies to exclude some foreign employees from the calculation of the ratio. Honeywell excluded workers from several countries where pay is most likely lower than in the United States. “The 333:1 ratio that Honeywell is reporting most likely would be even wider if Honeywell took all its workers into account,” the Institute said. — Peter Eavis A federal judge in Manhattan, in a brief order, rejected a motion filed by lawyers for Mr. Cohen and his firm, Point72 Asset Management, to temporarily seal a complaint filed last week by Lauren Bonner, an employee of the firm. Mr. Cohen’s lawyer had asked the judge to seal the lawsuit, which alleges the firm underpays female employees and fosters a hostile workplace for women, pending the resolution of another motion to push the matter into arbitration. Judge Analisa Torres of Federal District Court in Manhattan said the request to seal the entire complaint was “not narrowly tailored” and was inconsistent with the “presumption of public access” to court records. Lawyers for Mr. Cohen had sought to seal the order because it contained details of other employees’ compensation packages. The lawsuit also detailed a testosterone-fueled “boys’ club” atmosphere in which men commented frequently on women’s bodies and belittled their abilities. Advertisement — Matthew Goldstein Andrew writes: My latest column, on how banks and credit card companies could restrict support of gun sales in the wake of last week’s school shooting, has stirred up chatter in the business world. I’ve heard from people throughout corporate America overnight since it was published. Many said privately that they want to look at what they can do. More from the column: There is precedent for credit card issuers to ban the purchase of completely legal products. Just this month, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America banned the use of their cards to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. To be clear: Those three banks won’t let you use your credit card to buy Bitcoin, but they will happily let you use it to buy an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle — the same kind of gun used in mass shootings in Parkland; Newtown, Conn.; San Bernardino, Calif.; Las Vegas; and Sutherland Springs, Tex. Elsewhere in gun regulation: President Trump expressed some openness to tightening background checks. The United States Treasury Department is flooding the market with debt. On Tuesday, the government sold $179 billion worth of debt. Bloomberg reports: “Concerns about the U.S. borrowing cap had forced the Treasury to trim the total amount of bills it had outstanding, but that’s no longer a problem and the government is now busy ramping up issuance. Financing estimates from January show that the Treasury expects to issue $441 billion in net marketable debt in the current quarter and the bulk of that is likely to be in the short-term market.” That’s been a regular question since the tax overhaul was signed into law last year. Analysts at Goldman Sachs in a note over the weekend shed some light on the answer. • “Companies have pointed to a modest increase in investment as one destination for the incremental cash flow from tax reform. Consensus estimates for 2018 capex have increased by $17 billion (3 percent) since the passage of tax reform.” • Last month 39 S.&P. 500 companies increased their dividend, while for the first since 2012 no companies cut their payments. • Buying back shares remains a priority of companies, Goldman writes. Over the past 2 ½ months, S.&P. 500 firms have announced $171 billion of buybacks, $67 billion of which has come this year, a 22% increase from the same period in 2017. In the same note, Goldman also took a closer look at this earnings season. By many measures, corporate earnings are the strongest they have been in the past decade. Goldman points out: • Companies in the S.&P. 500 are set to report that profit grew 15 percent last quarter. That’s the fastest pace since 2011. Advertisement • The percentage of companies beating estimates is at its highest level since 2010. The percentage beating sales forecast is at its highest since 2004. But the stock reaction to S.&P. 500 companies either beating or missing expectations “has been muted relative to history.” The reason? Investors are more focused on tax reform and earnings forecasts for 2018, Goldman writes. Analysts have raised their 2018 earnings estimates for companies in the S.&P. 500 by 7 percent so far this year. Some context Higher profit margins because of the lower corporate tax rate are driving much of the increase in this year’s earnings forecast. A point that becomes clearer by looking at 2018 sales estimates. Analysts have increased their revenue forecasts by only one percentage point and much of that increase comes from higher oil prices boosting forecasts for energy companies. Remember when the company said that it was changing its name from Long Island Iced Tea and shift its corporate focus to virtual currencies? Well, new developments have come up: • Long Blockchain has named a new C.E.O., Shamyl Malik. • It plans to spin off its beverage division into the publicly traded Long Island Brand Beverages by June 30, and the company’s last C.E.O., Philip Thomas, will be on the new business’ board. • And last week, Nasdaq informed Long Blockchain that it planned to delist the company because its stock price had traded too low. Long Blockchain’s market cap as of this morning was $31.9 million, below Nasdaq’s threshold, after shares in the company tumbled amid the great crypto crash of early 2018. The company is appealing. — Michael de la Merced Here’s why the company’s shares are down 10percent — their biggest fall since 2015 — after its fourth-quarter earnings report: • The company earned $1.33 a share, while analysts had expected $1.37. • Operating income fell 28 percent, to $4.5 billion, thanks to charges tied to the closing of Sam’s Club stores. Advertisement • E-commerce sales rose 23 percent during the quarter, a slower pace than in previous quarters. • Full-year sales growth expectations went down by close to half, to 1.5 percent to 2 percent, in part because of Sam’s Club and a curb on the sales of tobacco products. What the company’s chief, Doug McMillon, said: “We’re making real progress putting our unique assets to work to serve customers in all the ways they want to shop.” — Michael de la Merced Days after Rob Goldman, its vice president of advertising, tried to clear up misconceptions about the company’s role in the 2016 presidential election, Facebook still finds itself in hot water. President Trump took the tweets as proof that Russia didn’t try to help him win, while critics said they contradicted Robert Mueller’s indictment. Mr. Goldman apologized in an internal Facebook post. But his tweets — which contained inaccuracies — suggested that Facebook executives still don’t understand how central the company was to Russia’s misinformation campaign, according to Nicholas Thomson of Wired. More from Kevin Roose of the NYT: In real-world terms, a part of Facebook still sees itself as the bank that got robbed, rather than the architect who designed a bank with no safes, and no alarms or locks on the doors, and then acted surprised when burglars struck.

 If headlines about an “Instant Pot recall” or an “Instant Pot meltdown” have been making you anxious, there’s reason for relief. Your beloved pressure cooker is probably fine. Instant Pot, the Canadian company whose electric multifunction pressure cookers became a must-have gift for many over the holiday season, said last week that it had received a small number of reports about overheating in the Gem 65 8-in-1 Multicooker. The company said it would replace the affected models of the device, which is not a pressure cooker. Instant Pot said that the only models of the Gem affected were those from five batches, marked with the batchcodes 1728, 1730, 1731, 1734 and 1746. Customers can check to see whether their Gems were included in those batches by finding a silver label on the bottom of the cooker. The batchcode is on the bottom right of the label. That said, if you do have a Gem in one of those batches, you should stop using it. Instant Pot has assured affected customers that they will be sent instructions on how to receive a free replacement. Advertisement The Gem multicooker, which (perhaps surprisingly) does not include pressure cooking among its eight functions, is not one of the company’s more popular models. It does not appear on the company home page and was introduced relatively recently, a company spokeswoman, Anna Meglio, said.  . She could not immediately answer questions about how many customers had reported that their device had overheated or when the first reports were received. She also did not know how many of the gadgets the company was prepared to replace. Instant Pot has said it was working with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission on the replacement. Advertisement Hip Cooking, a website for fans of pressure cooking, said in an article last month that the recently released Gem was the first model introduced by the company that was not an improvement on earlier devices. The writer, Laura Pazzaglia, cited an Amazon review that pointed out “there was nothing ‘instant’ about slow cooking.” (The review is no longer available online.) Instant Pot, a privately held company, experienced a wave of success last year, as sales of electric multicookers took off. The Instant Pot product was among the top five items sold by Amazon and Target on Black Friday and among the top three best-sellers at Kohl’s. The company told The New York Times in December that the Instant Pot’s sales have more than doubled every year since 2011. Fans of the device — so-called potheads — share recipes on Facebook and on other online forums. So breathe easy, Instant Pot owners. And just make sure you’re cleaning those condensation collectors.

T5,26-Feb-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin FEB. 26, 2018
  Good Monday. Here’s what we’re watching: • We’ve been parsing Warren Buffett’s annual letter to shareholders. • Stock investors beware: Inflation could soon jump. • Broadcom moves closer to striking a deal with Qualcomm, but the two remain far apart on price. • The Weinstein Company will file for bankruptcy. • Fidelity is rethinking its stock-picker system. • Businesses are reconsidering their relationships with the gun industry. • United Parcel Service has sued the European Commission after it blocked a 2013 deal for the Dutch delivery company TNT Express, which was later bought by its shipping rival FedEx.

Warren Buffett's annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders, released on Saturday, showed that the company had substantially increased its holdings of Apple stock. Advertisement The wager has done pretty well already. Berkshire Hathaway started gobbling up Apple stock just over a year ago. At the end of last year, its Apple position had a market value of $28.2 billion, according to the letter. The position cost Berkshire $21 billion, the letter said, which suggests a gain of $7.2 billion, or over 30 percent. The bet also outperformed a soaring stock market. In the past 12 months, Apple stock is up 31 percent, versus 17 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 index. What do the numbers say now? Apple, by some metrics, looks cheap. Its price-to-earnings ratio, a valuation yardstick that compares a company’s per-share profits to its stock price, is 15.5 times forecasted earnings for 2018. Facebook’s stock is at 26 times, Google is at 27 times, and Amazon is at a dizzying 184 times. Apple’s ratio is even smaller than the overall market’s. The bullish theory: Apple’s stock price will keep rising as investors come to see that it is undervalued. But shouldn’t investors have realized this years ago? Apple, after all, is a famous company, and investors have long been aware of its fat profit margins, its grip on consumers and its ability to generate billions of dollars of cash flow. But Apple is unimpressive in a way that often worries investors: It is a slower growing company. Google, Facebook and Amazon are all expected to increase their sales at a significantly faster clip than the 10 percent that Apple achieved in 2017. It would take a large number of additional iPhone sales, at higher prices, for Apple to have the sales growth of Google. And for premium priced products in a saturated market, generating higher sales can be tough, as weak demand for Apple’s iPhone X shows. Could investors become more bullish? It’s hard to know exactly why investors become willing to pay a lot more for certain companies. Amazon’s share price is up over 160 percent over the past two years, a period when business was strong, but not markedly stronger than investors expected. Sometimes the herd just changes its mind. And there are plenty of ways in which Apple excels. Speaking to CNBC on Monday, Mr. Buffett enthused about one. Once consumers own, say, an iPhone, they have a tendency to stay loyal to Apple products. “You are very, very, very locked in, at least psychologically and mentally, to the product you are using,” he said. — Peter Eavis With the stock market regaining much of the ground it lost after its steep sell-off earlier this month, it might seem like investors are done worrying about higher inflation. They may want to keep fretting, though. James W. Paulsen, a stock market strategist at the Leuthold Group, put out some new research on Monday that suggests that the inflation rate, 2.1 percent in January, could move a lot higher in coming months. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York calculate a metric that draws on both economic and financial data to try and assess the amount of inflation that is brewing in the economy. One version of the New York Fed’s “underlying inflation gauge” rose by 3 percent in January. Mr. Paulsen took historical data for this yardstick and found that, in the past, it was quite a good predictor of actual inflation. “Although not perfect and while the lead/lag relationship varies over time, the underlying inflation gauge has done a good job of forecasting future movements in the core inflation rate during the next 18 months,” he wrote. If this relationship holds up, inflation could be 2.6 percent by the end of this year, and 3 percent by the middle of 2019, Mr. Paulsen wrote. Of course, the relationship might break down in the near future. Advertisement Higher inflation would lead to higher bond yields (bond investors require a larger payout to protect themselves against inflation.) In turn, the higher bond yields would make stocks look more expensive (why pay up for stocks when bond payments are increasing in value?) As a result, stocks could sell off, if the yields on bellwether bonds like the 10-year Treasury note keeps spiking. On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 2.86 percent, from 2.87 percent on Friday. Stocks moved higher. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index closed up 1.2 percent and is now just 3.2 percent off the high it reached just before its plunge at the start of this month. — Peter Eavis But the two remain far apart on price. On Monday, Qualcomm’s board in a letter to Hock Tan, Broadcom’s chief executive, said the two sides have made progress addressing Qualcomm’s regulatory concerns and proposed the two companies hold a meeting that focuses on negotiating the price. From the statement accompanying the letter: The Qualcomm Board believes the meeting led to further progress toward a possible negotiated transaction on key issues other than price. The Board authorized providing Broadcom with a mark-up of Broadcom’s previously released draft merger agreement that, if agreed to by Broadcom, would resolve all issues between the two companies other than price. But Broadcom reiterated in the February 23 meeting that its reduced $79.00 per share proposal is its best and final proposal. The Qualcomm Board is unanimous in its view that each of Broadcom’s proposals, including its prior $82.00 per share proposal, materially undervalues Qualcomm, and the Board encourages Broadcom to enter into mutual due diligence and price negotiations. So what price is Qualcomm pushing for? The FT reports that “Qualcomm is insisting that Broadcom raises its offer by at least 15 percent to above $90 per share, up from its current $79 per share bid.” Republican politicians in Georgia, where Delta Air Lines is headquartered, are hitting back at the company, reports Leslie Josephs of CNBC. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle tweeted: 
            I will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA. Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back.         Rick Jeffares, a candidate for lieutenant governor and former Georgia state senator, weighed in with: 
            I stand with the NRA & support our 2nd Amendment rights. Delta Airlines is now seeking $40 MILLION TAX BREAK from the GA Legislature. I'm leading the charge to let Delta know their attack on the NRA and our 2nd Amendment is unacceptable. #StandWithJeffareshttps://t.co/YQ16VcGch2 pic.twitter.com/1x256htX9u  Writes Ms. Josephs: After its tweet announcing the end of the NRA discounts, Delta said in a statement that the “decision reflects the airline’s neutral status in the current national debate over gun control amid recent school shootings” and that it was taken “out of respect for our customers and employees on both sides.” The airline added that “it continues to support the Second Amendment.” He certainly sees the need. In his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders, Mr. Buffett said: Berkshire’s goal is to substantially increase the earnings of its non-insurance group. For that to happen, we will need to make one or more huge acquisitions. We certainly have the resources to do so. At year end Berkshire held $116.0 billion in cash. But will he have the opportunity? Mr. Buffett bemoaned the sky-high purchase prices that “proved a barrier to virtually all deals we reviewed in 2017.” Critics’ corner • Tara Lachapelle of Bloomberg Gadfly writes: “The best way Buffett can solidify his legacy is by returning to the M&A market with the same force and determination he’s always shown. He may need to pay more than he wants to, but what’s a little extra to Berkshire in the long run?” • Mr. Buffett is on the wrong side of a generational shift, writes John Foley in Breakingviews. In contrast, BlackRock and Vanguard have waded in and called for companies to do good. That attitude is already baked into the Buffett view, Mr. Foley writes, “But notions of what’s now referred to as ESG — environmental, social and governance factors — are otherwise fuzzy in Berkshire’s universe.” Advertisement Other highlights from the letter • Berkshire’s windfall of $29.6 billion from the U.S. tax overhaul was only slightly offset by $1.4 billion of tax payments on repatriated earnings. Mr. Buffett did not expand on his recent criticisms of tax cuts. Read more about what he did focus on here. • Mr. Buffett railed against a new accounting rule that will affect future quarterly and annual reports. The change requires companies to include in earnings the gains and losses on stocks they hold but have not sold. Because Berkshire holds $170 billion of stocks, the impact on Berkshire’s bottom line could be significant. Peter Eavis of The Times notes: It would indeed be notable if Berkshire started to publish “adjusted earnings,” or financial statements that exclude certain items. In last year’s annual report, Mr. Buffett criticized companies that publish adjusted earnings that leave out costs like stock awards to executives. At the annual meeting on May 5, a shareholder may want to ask why shareholders should be asked to overlook losses on stocks. Related Michael Kives, a longtime Hollywood agent at Creative Artists Agency who has consulted and represented Mr. Buffett — as well as Mikhail Gorbachev, Katy Perry and Jessica Alba, among others — is striking out on his own with a new firm, K5. It will provide advisory services for companies “across media, sports, technology, finance, politics, and a variety of other industries,” according to an announcement expected to go out later today. United Parcel Service has sued European antitrust regulators for a decision they made five years ago that blocked its takeover of the Dutch delivery company TNT Express, according to a record of court proceedings published on Monday. U.P.S. had pursued the TNT merger in the hope of gaining a larger presence in Europe and in emerging markets, but European officials rejected it because of concerns that the transaction would decrease competition and increase prices. The General Court of the European Union annulled the decision by European Commission regulators last year, in part because the commission had used different economic models at different times to evaluate the deal. The commission, the executive arm of the European Union, has appealed that ruling to Europe’s highest court. Facing a deadline to seek damages, U.P.S. filed a claim in December seeking 1.74 billion euros, or about $2.14 billion, plus interest, according to a notice published on Monday. U.P.S. is also seeking court costs and compensation for any taxes it may have to pay on the damage amount. U.P.S. agreed to acquire TNT in a transaction valued at $6.8 billion in March 2012, but European regulators said they would block the deal because they were worried that a merger would effectively leave the Continent’s shipping market with just two main players: U.P.S. and DHL. U.P.S. withdrew its offer in January 2013. Advertisement A shipping rival, FedEx Corporation, agreed to acquire TNT in a $4.8 billion deal in 2015, completing the deal after receiving approval from European regulators the next year. — Chad Bray Talks about a sale to a group led by Maria Contreras-Sweet have collapsed. The group had offered to pay about $275 million for the company, plus the assumption of $225 million in debt. The Weinstein board blamed Ms. Contreras-Sweet and one of her primary backers, Ron Burkle. “Late last night, you returned to us an incomplete document that unfortunately does not keep your promises,” it said in a letter. “That is regrettable, but not in our power to change.” The board, which includes Bob Weinstein, accused Ms. Contreras-Sweet’s team of failing to provide funding to keep the studio operating while the deal was completed and said she had proposed new sale conditions that meant the transaction would take much longer to close. The mutual fund giant is considering abandoning the investment process that made its managers famous, unnamed sources told the WSJ. Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . The context  The change comes after an outside review of behavior within the stock-picking unit and reports of sexual harassment allegations. More from the WSJ’s Sarah Krouse and Kirsten Grind: Stock picking has been under unprecedented pressure in recent years as investors have poured money into low-cost index-tracking funds. The star-manager system helped fuel careers of top fund managers at the family-run firm, but it also created a system in which portfolio managers wielded outsize power over analysts, more than a dozen current and former employees said. Blackstone asked outside fund managers to detail their ownership in companies that make or sell guns by Sunday evening, according to unnamed sources that spoke to the WSJ. Bank of America said it was examining its relationship with the weapons industry, too.

Many have watched warily as Mr. Xi has used his power to imprison scores of dissidents, stifle free speech and tighten oversight of the economy, the world’s second largest. The plan could also exacerbate a tense relationship between Beijing and Washington, which is preparing plans to impose tariffs on Chinese imports and to limit Chinese investments in the U.S. Critics’ corner • Christopher Beddor of Breakingviews: “Opaque as it is, international companies and investment firms had grown accustomed to the rules of the Chinese political game as it has been played for two decades.

 Toys “R” Us, the beleaguered chain under pressure from Amazon and bigger toy sellers, may close dozens more stores as it struggles to find a path out of bankruptcy and return to financial viability. The toy retailer has not recovered from a dismal holiday selling season, making the company’s difficult situation even worse. Now, it is under pressure to demonstrate to its lenders that it has a realistic strategy for flourishing in the ultracompetitive toy industry. One plan under discussion includes shutting down close to 200 stores, and possibly more, according to people briefed on the matter, who were not authorized to speak publicly. While the planning is fluid and far from completion, the possible store closings, which were reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal, reflect the serious challenges that Toys “R” Us faces. Advertisement “If you look at the numbers, it doesn’t look good,” said Richard Gottlieb, an analyst and the publisher of Global Toy News. “And it appears that some dramatic action is going to have to take place.’’ Advertisement Toys “R” Us has already been taking steps to stabilize its business. Last month, the company said it was shutting down 182 stores, affecting 4,500 workers. It is not clear whether any additional closings would occur in the United States, or overseas. The company operates about 800 stores in the United States. Even as other retailers experienced strong holiday sales, Toys “R” Us cited undisclosed “operational missteps” in explaining its poor performance.  . Analysts say the company’s biggest problem stems from its filing last year for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, after its private equity owners left it saddled with $5 billion in debt. The bankruptcy filing, only months before Christmas, left many shoppers with the impression that the company was shutting down, even though it planned to keep all its stores operating through the holidays, said Jim Silver, the editor of TTPM, a toy review website. “There was too much consumer perception that they were not going to be around, and it hurt their traffic incredibly,” Mr. Silver said. “When you are buying toys, you want to know you can return them and your gift cards will work.” Another big challenge came from competitors like Walmart and Amazon, which pushed toys heavily during the holiday season, just as Toys “R” Us was struggling to win back customers and calm jittery vendors. Toys “R” Us is entering a crucial time, as it prepares to buy toys to sell for the next holiday season. It needs to persuade its lenders, which have extended money to the company in bankruptcy, to keep that spigot flowing. But lenders need to know that the company is viable over the long term. Analysts say that a primarily bricks-and-mortar toy retailer can succeed, but that its stores have to be smaller, unlike the hulking Toys “R” Us facilities that dot suburban strip malls. Advertisement “A toy store needs to be fun and engaging and interactive,” said Mr. Silver. “Toys “R” Us has been talking about better customer service and experiences, but they never really transpired.” A version of this article appears in print on February 23, 2018, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Toys ‘R’ Us Contemplates Closing 200 More Stores.

 Walmart is starting its own mattress and bedding brand that will be sold exclusively online, part of the giant retailer’s effort to bolster its e-commerce business. The new line, which will include items like pillows and throws, will be sold through a separate website, AllswellHome.com, but it will not be immediately available on the company’s flagship website Walmart.com or in its roughly 4,700 stores. The new offering — which Walmart describes as an “Instagram-worthy dream bed” — aims at the more affluent and digitally savvy customer that the retailer has been making a big push to reach in recent years. Previously, the company sought to tap this market with a string of acquisitions of e-commerce brands like Bonobos, which sells hip men’s clothes. Advertisement But the mattress and bedding venture represents the first digitally native, or online only, brand that Walmart has developed internally. Advertisement “This is how great brands get built,” said Andy Dunn, a founder of Bonobos and senior vice president of digital brands at Walmart. “We are thinking about how we win the future.” The Allswell venture, which goes live next month, comes as concern mounts on Wall Street about Walmart’s e-commerce performance. On Tuesday, Walmart’s stock cratered after the company reported that e-commerce sales growth had slowed considerably in its fiscal fourth quarter, which included the holiday shopping season. The company blamed operational glitches in its fulfillments network for some of the problem. But the pronounced slowdown, after several quarters of blistering online growth, caused analysts and investors to question whether there were deeper issues with Walmart’s online strategy. The company has spent handsomely on its online efforts, including the $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com in 2016, which at the time was the largest price paid for an e-commerce company. It also bought Modcloth, the e-commerce clothing brand, and Moosejaw, which sells outdoor gear.  . These investments are part of Walmart’s response to its rival Amazon, which continues to dominate online retail. The bet with the mattress and bedding line is that women, in particular, will be drawn to the convenience and premium style of the new brand, which is carefully curated on the website. Walmart is offering two mattresses — one soft version and one firm. They range in price from $495 for a twin to $1,035 for a king. Advertisement In recent years, there has been a boom in upstart mattress sellers like Casper and Leesa, which have sold their products primarily online. Their success showed that many customers were willing to buy a mattress without trying it first in a store. But even some of these companies have teamed up with large conventional retailers like Target and Pottery Barn to offer their mattresses in stores. Amazon also sells mattresses and bedding. Arlyn Davich, who founded an online service that helps lower-income people with financial planning and nutrition, will run the Allswell bedding line for Walmart. Allswell will allow customers a 100-day trial of the mattress and will not charge for returns, a standard practice for online mattress sellers. The retailer will also haul away a shopper’s old mattress when the new one is delivered for a $50 fee.

 Within hours of announcing its decision to end a credit card relationship with the National Rifle Association, the First National Bank of Omaha found itself thrust into the center of the resurgent national gun debate. Its Twitter and Facebook pages were flooded with comments. Some customers applauded the 160-year-old bank’s decision. Others said they would take their business elsewhere. In the aftermath of the deadly school shooting in Florida last week, businesses were making the same financial and moral calculus, quickly discovering that there is no neutral ground. As pressure mounted across various social media platforms on Friday, a number of corporations, including several car-rental companies, MetLife insurance, Symantec security software and the car pricing and information site TrueCar, abruptly announced plans to cut ties with the organization. The actions continued on Saturday. Delta and United Airlines both issued statements saying they were ending discount programs with the N.R.A. and would ask the association to remove their information from its website. Advertisement Over the last couple of years, social media has become the preferred vehicle for the rise of consumer activism, turning the everyday purchase of dresses or shoes or, now, renting a car or buying insurance, into a form of protest or demonstration of ideology. Advertisement “MetLife didn’t shoot anyone, but I just can’t pay them,” Clark Bacon, a research assistant at a children’s hospital, said in an interview Friday morning, after posting about his frustration on the company’s Facebook page. He had pledged to cancel his MetLife auto and home insurance package, for which he spends nearly $9,000 a year, after learning that the company offered N.R.A. members pre-negotiated discounts. For companies like MetLife that are caught in the middle of these angry social media storms, actions tied to divisive social issues can be a lose-lose proposition. A year ago, Nordstrom first faced calls for a consumer boycott because it carried the Ivanka Trump line of clothing. But it quickly drew another round of boycott cries from the other side of the ideological spectrum when it quietly stopped selling her products. Marketing experts say it’s difficult to determine whether calls for boycotts can truly have an impact on a company’s business. Rather, they say, once-angry customers either forget or move on to the next event or debate. “Memories fade. The intensity of the feelings that people have on this subject right now will feel different one month or five months from now,” said Maurice Schweitzer, a professor of operations, information and decisions at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. In the aftermath of nearly all of the mass shootings in the United States, there have been attempts to pressure lawmakers and companies that manufacture or sell guns to change. After the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, both the California’s state pension fund and the California teachers pension fund divested their stakes in gun manufacturers. And after a gunman used an accessory called a bump stock in a mass shooting in Las Vegas last October, two retailers, Walmart and the outdoors store Cabela’s, removed the products from their websites. But in the days since the Florida school shooting, the push for boycotts and meaningful change has mobilized faster than with previous mass shootings. Professor Schweitzer noted that reflected the fact that the survivors are teenagers who are well versed in the usage and power of social media. Advertisement On Twitter, the hashtag #stopNRAmazon was a rallying cry aimed at pressuring Amazon to stop streaming content from NRATV, the gun group’s online video channel. The effort quickly drew support from Hollywood as actors like Alyssa Milano, Denis O’Hare, Evan Handler and Misha Collins posted on social media in support of the campaign; several noted that Amazon prohibits the sale of firearms on its e-commerce site. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. Leading retailers including Cabela’s, Walmart and Bass Pro Shops also came under renewed boycott calls on Twitter for selling guns or sponsoring N.R.A. events. The retailers did not respond to emails seeking comment.  . Still, in some cases, the rapid assembly on Twitter and Facebook may have resulted in a speedy response. In less than 24 hours, at least eight companies that had offered N.R.A. members discounts or special deals announced plans to separate or end affiliations with the organization, including Hertz, Enterprise and Avis Budget; SimpliSafe, which gave N.R.A. members two months of free home security monitoring; and North American and Allied Van Lines. “North American and Allied Van Lines no longer have an affiliate relationship with the N.R.A. effective immediately,’’ the company said in an emailed statement. “We have asked them to remove our listing from their benefits site.” Even companies that do not have ties to the N.R.A. nevertheless rushed to distance themselves from the group. Wyndham Hotels said in a statement that it ended its relationship with the trade group in late 2017. Best Western Hotels & Resorts tweeted to dozens of customers that it “does not have an affiliation with and is not a corporate partner” of the N.R.A. Earlier this week, lists of companies that were part of the N.R.A. membership program began circulating over Facebook and Twitter. A Change.org petition asked 25 companies, including North American Van Lines and the hearing aid company Starkey Hearing Technologies, to break their connection with the N.R.A. The petition had more than 1,100 signatures by midday Friday. With lists of companies circulating widely, Facebook users swarmed the profiles of Avis, MetLife and others, announcing their plans to end their patronage and switch to competitors. Rob Bradford, a designer who travels frequently, said Friday morning he would take the $600 he spends each year renting vehicles from Avis to competing rental companies if Avis did not disavow the N.R.A. “I know that boycotts work, especially in the age of social media,” he said. “I will go out of my way to avoid businesses associated with that group even if that means spending more money.” Advertisement By Friday afternoon, Avis Budget Group, which owns the car rental companies Avis and Budget, said it had decided to end its discount partnership with the N.R.A., effective on March 26, according to a representative. Late Thursday, the First National Bank of Omaha, which calls itself the largest privately owned bank holding company in the country, said that it would not renew its contract with the trade group to issue an N.R.A.-branded credit card. The card had been advertised as “the official credit card of the N.R.A.,” and cardholders were offered a $40 credit with their first purchase. But the move drew strong, even extreme, reaction on the bank’s Facebook page. “You are doing the right thing by dropping the NRA,” one user wrote. “They are a hate group with blood on their hands. Thank you for walking away from them.” But the opposing viewpoint was evident as well. “I discontinued my account with you last night for discontinuing the relationship with the NRA,” another user wrote. “I will encourage all NRA members and gun supporters to do the same. There are 100 million gun owners and 5 million NRA members. Good luck.” A version of this article appears in print on February 24, 2018, on Page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: Connection To N.R.A. Can Be Bad For Business.

 NEW YORK —  Walmart wants a bigger slice of the crowded meal kits business, announcing Monday that it will offer easy-to-make dinners in more stores this year. The move puts the world's largest retailer in direct competition with meal-kit companies such as Blue Apron and HelloFresh, which deliver boxes of raw meat and chopped vegetables to subscribers' doorsteps. After Walmart's announcement Monday, Blue Apron's stock tumbled 5 percent. Walmart said its meal kits, which will expand from 250 stores to more than 2,000, will be available in its deli section or can be ordered online and picked up later that day. It is offering three types of kits: pre-portioned meals that need to be cooked; ingredients that pair with its rotisserie chicken; or one-step dishes that just need to be heated up. The meals feed two people and are priced between $8 and $15. Several companies already offer meal kits, both online and in stores. Amazon, which bought grocer Whole Foods last year, sells meal kits on its site and at its recently-opened convenience store in Seattle. Albertsons Cos., the owner of Safeway, Carrs and other supermarkets, bought online meal-kit service Plated last year to sell the kits at its 2,300 stores. Blue Apron Holdings Inc., meanwhile, has struggled since it became a publicly-traded company in June; it recently said it lost 15 percent of its customers last year compared with the year before. Its shares are down 74 percent since its initial public offering price of $10. Walmart Inc., based in Bentonville, Arkansas, said its meal kits will be made in stores. Its dishes will include meatloaf, spaghetti and meatballs and chicken fried rice. We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.

 NEW YORK — U.S. stocks rallied on Monday as fears of a global trade war ebbed with investors betting that U.S. President Donald Trump would back down on his threat to impose hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Strategists also cited rising oil prices and ebbing concerns after an Italian election for a relief rally in the three major U.S. equity indexes. Investors started to eye Trump's threat as a negotiating tool after he tweeted that Canada and Mexico could avoid his proposed tariffs if they ceded ground in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) talks. A lack of specific retaliatory measures from other countries was also reassuring, said Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist, Allianz Global Investors in New York. Advertisement ""It felt like (Trump) revealed some of his cards with that Twitter comment.

 Shane Smith is preparing to cede his position as Vice Media’s chief executive officer to Nancy Dubuc, who announced on Monday that she was stepping down as chief executive of A&E Networks, according to people briefed on the matter. Mr. Smith, 48, is expected to remain at Vice Media — potentially as its chairman, said one of the people, who requested anonymity because the moves were not yet final. Ms. Dubuc, 49, was in talks to take on the chief executive job after she leaves A&E Networks, the television group owned by Hearst and Disney, the people said. Ms. Dubuc has built close ties with Vice since A&E Networks invested $250 million in the company in 2014. Ms. Dubuc, who serves on the board of Vice and is known to be close with Mr. Smith, oversaw the joint venture that started the Viceland TV network in 2016. In recent years, Mr. Smith emerged not only as the face of Vice but as the media mogul for the digital age. The combination of a brash maverick and a consummate salesman, Mr. Smith helped transform Vice from a freebie punk magazine started in Montreal in 1994 into a global company with about 3,000 employees, a TV network, a digital outlet, a film-production company and programs on HBO. Vice is backed by corporate giants like Disney and Fox. Advertisement But there was a dark side to that ascent. In December, a New York Times investigation detailed the mistreatment of women at the company and found four settlements involving allegations of sexual harassment or defamation against Vice employees. In addition, more than two dozen women said they had experienced or witnessed sexual misconduct at the company, including unwanted kisses, groping, lewd remarks and propositions for sex. Advertisement In response to the article, Mr. Smith and Suroosh Alvi, who founded Vice Media with Mr. Smith, said in a statement that “from the top down, we have failed as a company to create a safe and inclusive workplace where everyone, especially women, can feel respected and thrive.” They said that a “boys club” culture at Vice had “fostered inappropriate behavior that permeated throughout the company” and pledged a number of changes, including pay parity by the end of 2018. Since then, Vice’s leadership has been in turmoil. Its chief digital officer, Mike Germano, left the company after it looked into harassment allegations against him. The company’s president, Andrew Creighton, has been on leave while the board reviews a $135,000 settlement involving sexual harassment allegations against him from a former employee. And in February, a former employee sued the company, claiming that it had marginalized women and systematically discriminated against them by paying men substantially more for similar work. News that Ms. Dubuc was in talks to take on the chief executive job at Vice was first reported by Variety.  Her future has been the subject of intense speculation in the media industry over the past two months.  . Ms. Dubuc was a finalist for the top job at Amazon Studios, a position that ultimately went to the NBC executive Jennifer Salke (Ms. Salke started at Amazon on Monday). Around the time that Ms. Salke was offered the job last month, a person close to Ms. Dubuc said that she had grown weary of the extended interview process and removed herself from the proceedings with the plan of signing a contract that was waiting for her at A&E Networks, which counts A&E, History and Lifetime among its stations. Her return seemed like a settled matter. Even in the chatty confines of the media business, few people foresaw that the top Vice job would be in Ms. Dubuc’s future. Ms. Dubuc and Ms. Salke are prominent female media executives who have made huge moves in recent months, at a time when female leadership is at a premium. The Fox TV group co-chief executive, Dana Walden, has a contract that is expiring this summer, and her next move is also being watched with keen interest within the entertainment industry. Advertisement Ms. Dubuc plans to step down from her post at A&E on April 16. Abbe Raven, a longtime A&E executive who retired from the company in 2015, will lead the company until a replacement is found, Hearst and Disney said in a statement announcing Ms. Dubuc’s departure. In the statement, Ms. Dubuc said that she had called A&E Networks home for nearly 20 years and was ready for a new challenge. “Anyone who knows me well knows I am an entrepreneur, creator, rebel and disruptor at heart,” she said. “I have a famous neon sign in my office that blares ‘Who dares wins.’ After 20 years at A&E, the hardest thing will be to leave the people and company I love. But, as a creative executive and leader, and to stay true to my personal mantra, I need my next dare and my next challenge.” John Koblin contributed reporting.

 ___ Bids to curb health care costs offer little more than talk WASHINGTON (AP) — What began as bipartisan attempt to curb soaring health care premiums in the nation's health insurance markets is faltering in Congress. At fault are escalating demands from each party and erratic positions by President Donald Trump. Democrats want bigger federal subsidies for consumers under President Barack Obama's health care law. Republicans aim to relax its coverage requirements and win abortion restrictions. The bickering could collapse the whole effort, with each side blaming the other. ___ Trump says commerce secretary will talk tariffs with EU WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump says his commerce secretary will be talking to the European Union about tariffs that he argues have been unfair to the United States. Writing on Twitter, Trump says Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will speak with EU representatives about ""eliminating the large Tariffs and Barriers they use against the U.S.A."" The president announced last week that the United States would impose heavy tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, with some countries potentially exempted. ___ Get Started: Can't pay the IRS? You do have options NEW YORK (AP) — With a little more than five weeks until this year's tax filing deadline of April 17, many small business owners are tussling with the question, how am I going to pay my taxes? When owners haven't set aside enough money to cover their taxes, they do have options, including using savings, borrowing money or working out a payment plan with the IRS. But not filing a return because you can't pay isn't one of them. The IRS levies hefty penalties when a tax return is filed after the deadline. ___ Apple adds more 'Texture' to its services with magazine deal SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple has bought digital magazine distributor Texture to extend its subscription services beyond music and online storage. The deal announced Monday puts Apple in control of a service that is often described as a Netflix of magazines. Texture offers readers access to articles in more than 200 magazines for $10 per month, much like Netflix sells unlimited access to its video programming. Apple didn't disclose the price it is paying for Texture. Advertisement ___ Goldman Sachs CEO succession clearer with Schwartz retiring NEW YORK (AP) — Harvey Schwartz, a top executive at Goldman Sachs, is retiring next month, clearing the way for David Solomon to eventually become the next chief executive of the Wall Street firm. Schwartz and Solomon jointly hold the positions of co-chief operating officer and president. Both had been considered likely successors to Lloyd Blankfein, the current CEO. Advertisement ___ House Democrat seeks data on Trump firm donation to Treasury WASHINGTON (AP) — A senior House Democrat is asking the Trump Organization and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to provide more information on a $151,470 donation the Trump family firm turned over to the government. President Donald Trump pledged last year to donate profits from foreign government patronage at his company's properties. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., asked a Trump Organization lawyer to provide documents on the company's foreign government payments and how it calculated its donation.  . ___ China shrinks steel industry slowly, drawing Western ire BEIJING (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump's blanket tariff hike on steel and aluminum reflects American ire over a flood of low-cost exports from China, whose steel output accounts for half the world's supply. The industry swelled over the past decade to support a history-making Chinese construction boom. China has closed some steel mills but is moving too gradually to defuse American and European anger at a flood of low-cost exports. ___ US budget deficit jumped to $215.2 billion in February WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal government recorded a budget deficit of $215.2 billion in February, up significantly from a year ago as the impact of the GOP tax cuts passed in December begin to surface. The Treasury Department reports that the February deficit was 12.1 percent higher than a year ago, reflecting in part a drop of $5 billion in individual withholding taxes paid last month compared to a year ago. ___ Tech gains but industrials slide, leaving indexes mixed NEW YORK (AP) — Technology companies continue to rally Monday while industrial companies slump, leaving stock indexes mixed at the close of trading. The tech industry has led the market's recovery from its recent lows while industrials were coming off a big gain Friday. Retailers including Amazon and Starbucks also made gains. ___ The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 3.55 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,783.02.

 Good Monday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Trump puts an end to Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm. • David Solomon is Goldman Sachs’s heir apparent. • Can Solomon get Goldman playing a new tune? • Apple agrees to buy Texture. • Short Netflix • Dropbox unveils its I.P.O. target. Get this in your inbox every morning. Sign up here. President Trump on Monday blocked Broadcom’s bid for the chip maker Qualcomm, citing national security concerns. In a presidential order, Mr. Trump said “there is credible evidence” that led him to believe Singapore-based Broadcom’s control of Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, “might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.” Advertisement The extraordinary action by the president underscored the more forceful and protectionist action his administration has taken in recent weeks to protect American companies and ward off foreign investment in the United States. It followed an intervention this month by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which typically works behind closed doors and reviews deals only after they are announced, to stall the deal because of national security concerns. Advertisement From President Trump’s order: (a) There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that Broadcom Limited, a limited company organized under the laws of Singapore (Broadcom), along with its partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates, including Broadcom Corporation, a California corporation, and Broadcom Cayman L.P., a Cayman Islands limited partnership, and their partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates (together, the Purchaser), through exercising control of Qualcomm Incorporated (Qualcomm), a Delaware corporation, might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States; and (b) Provisions of law, other than section 721 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), do not, in my judgment, provide adequate and appropriate authority for me to protect the national security in this matter. Further down (e) The Purchaser and Qualcomm shall immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover. Immediately upon completion of all steps necessary to terminate the proposed takeover of Qualcomm, the Purchaser and Qualcomm shall certify in writing to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) that such termination has been effected in accordance with this order and that all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the proposed takeover of Qualcomm have been completed. Most C.E.O.s have to go to work each day and grind out better margins in highly competitive businesses that taxpayers won’t bail out if they blow up. This is now the fate that awaits the next C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs. In apparently priming David M. Solomon for the job, Goldman seems to be signaling that, even if trading revenue revives after some difficult quarters, it intends to press on with its efforts to bolster its nontrading businesses, like lending to corporations and consumers. Mr. Solomon, after a successful run as the head of Goldman’s powerful deal-making business, embodies in many ways the bank’s hopes to be far more than a high-octane trading shop. Of course, if the Trump administration guts Wall Street regulations, particularly the Volcker Rule, Goldman may be tempted to pile back into trading. But the bank’s recent track record in trading suggests that would not be a good idea. Not only does Goldman’s business that trades bonds, derivatives, currencies and commodities bounce around too much for shareholders’ tastes, it is opaque. Bank executives are often loath to talk in detail when it underperforms. Goldman also made strategic mistakes in this business in recent years. It focused too heavily on hedge fund clients, something it is trying to fix by reaching out to different types of customers. Its commodities business, which it clung to in the face of political pressure, has been a drawn out disappointment. And Wall Street traders ought not to get too excited about the prospects of deregulation. As some rules get loosened, others may get toughened up, like those that would liquidate a troubled Wall Street firm rather than bail it out. While the government may not be winding down any large banks anytime soon, the diminished likelihood of bailouts can force up the cost of borrowing for firms like Goldman. This, in turn, may steer them away from riskier businesses like trading. Investors still seem to doubt Goldman’s desire to adapt to a much more ordinary future. This is revealed in a comparison of Goldman and its rival, Morgan Stanley. Advertisement Goldman’s return on shareholder equity, a closely watched metric that quantifies the profits generated on shareholders’ money, has been higher than that of Morgan Stanley in recent years. But investors seem just as enthusiastic about the future of Morgan Stanley. Its stock trades at the same multiple to shareholders equity as Goldman’s. Why? Morgan Stanley has arguably done more than Goldman to diversify away from trading to businesses, like wealth management, that are more stable. — Peter Eavis David M. Solomon is Goldman Sachs’s heir apparent. The Wall Street firm said Mr. Solomon would serve as its sole president and chief operating officer, setting him up as the potential successor to Lloyd C. Blankfein, the investment bank’s longtime chief executive. Context Mr. Solomon and Harvey M. Schwartz were seen as the favorites to eventually replace Mr. Blankfein when they were named co-chief operating officers and presidents in December 2016. But, Mr. Schwartz, who previously served as the bank’s chief financial officer and global co-head of the securities division, has decided to retire in April, Goldman said on Monday. “Harvey has been a mentor to many, and his influence has made an indelible impact on generations of professionals at Goldman Sachs,” Mr. Blankfein said in a news release. “I want to thank Harvey for all he’s done for the firm.” Mr. Solomon joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 and previously served as co-head of its investment banking division. — Chad Bray Critic’s corner Anthony Currie of Breakingviews writes: “If Solomon does take the reins, it would end some 12 years of traders holding top positions at the Wall Street firm – and serve as another sign of Goldman’s troubles in that business.” Case in point: • Trading accounted for 53 percent of Goldman’s revenue in 2012. • It made just over a third of the firm’s revenue last year. Advertisement “Meanwhile, takings from merger advisory and stock-and-bond underwriting – Solomon’s world – increased by half over the past six years. So positioning him as likely heir would look like a way of rewarding past success.” Goldman’s reputation for advising companies in mergers and acquisitions is well earned. Most years, it tops the rankings of advisers by deal volume known as the league tables. So it was a bit surprising to see Goldman currently ranked fifth on both the global and the United States league tables. Here’s a look: Global  Morgan Stanley: $228.88 billion JPMorgan: $198.82 billion Bank of America Merrill Lynch: $138.76 billion Lazard: $134.39 billion Goldman Sachs: $131.56 billion United States Morgan Stanley: $132.36 billion Lazard: $119.69 billion JPMorgan: $114.37 billion Centerview: $112.75 billion Goldman Sachs: $102.54 billion Two points to note: 1) It is still early in the year and one big deal can reshuffle the rankings; 2) The value of transactions Goldman has advised on this year is up 31 percent from the same period a year ago. Larry Kudlow emerged Monday as the latest favorite in a changing rotation of potential replacements for Gary D. Cohn as the head the National Economic Council. The job has not been formally offered to Mr. Kudlow, but the CNBC television commentator, who has informally advised President Trump on economic issues, is likely to interview him in the coming days. Context From the NYT’s Maggie Haberman and Jim Tankersley:  Heading into the weekend, the top contender to replace Mr. Cohn was Christopher Liddell, who is a special assistant to the president working with the Office of American Innovation on a team led by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser. Mr. Liddell’s previous experience as a chief financial officer for Microsoft had been seen as a selling point. But after The New York Times reported that Mr. Liddell was under consideration, Mr. Trump received pushback from people both inside and outside the White House, according to the people close to the president. On Monday, The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board wrote a piece critical of Mr. Liddell’s views on free trade. On Sunday, Mr. Trump again began discussing Mr. Kudlow as an option, the people close to the president said. In a revised prospectus filed this morning, the online storage company said that it planned to sell 36 million shares at $16 to $18 a share. At the midpoint of that range, Dropbox would be valued at about $7.5 billion, compared to the $10 billion of its most recent private fund-raising. Advertisement The big thought: The Dropbox offering — along with that of Spotify — could show how interested Wall Street investors are in the latest batch of Silicon Valley “unicorns,” or privately held companies worth at least $1 billion. The man who made Dropbox: Meet Drew Houston, who created a multibillion-dollar business because he forgot to bring a USB flash drive one day while a student at M.I.T. His holdings could be worth nearly $1.7 billion The market for initial public offerings is on a tear, and, going by Dropbox’s latest financial filing, it may be getting a little overheated. Dropbox, a company that stores files on remote computers for consumers and businesses, on Monday said it aims to price its shares at between $16 and $18. The midpoint of those two prices would value Dropbox at around $6.8 billion, excluding some shares that may be awarded to executives in the future. That’s a lot, though about 30 percent below the $10 billion valuation it received after its fundraising round in 2014. At $6.8 billion, Dropbox would be trading at just over six times the $1.1 billion in sales it had for 2017. Companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index trade at 2.3 times sales. Dropbox would also have a higher valuation than Box, another file storage company, whose market value is 5.6 times the revenue it generated in its last fiscal year, which ended in January. Investors may, however, decide that Dropbox’s higher valuation is not justified. True, its sales grew at an impressive 31 percent last year, but that is not materially faster than the 27 percent Box achieved in its latest fiscal year. (Revenue grew 6.3 percent at companies in the S.&P. 500, according to FactSet.) Advertisement Neither company made a profit in their most recent fiscal year. Both are generating positive cash flows, though. And at $330 million last year, Dropbox’s cash flows were more than five times those of Box’s $62 million. If Dropbox went public at the $6.8 billion implied in Monday’s filing, it would trade at 21 times its 2017 cash flows. That is pricey, but that is less than half of Box’s cash flow multiple. — Peter Eavis Speculation has long swirled that Apple should buy Netflix. On Monday, the iPhone maker agreed to buy Texture, the “Netflix of magazines.” Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . The digital magazine app offers users a $10 a month subscription to read more than 200 magazines, including People, the New Yorker, Vanity Fair, and Vogue. The deal is part of Apple’s effort to bolster its services businesses. The WSJ reports: Apple has set a goal of increasing total revenue from services to more than $40 billion by 2020. The company generated nearly $30 billion in services revenue in its fiscal year ended in September. The Texture transaction follows Apple’s deal for Shazam, the music recognition app, in December. Texture is owned by Next Issue Media, a joint-venture between Condé Nast, Hearst, Meredith, News Corp, Rogers Media and K.K.R. Apple did not disclose the price. Shares of the video streaming company are down 3.4 percent Monday to about $320 after the short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research tweeted that he thinks the stock can be ”shorted back to $300.”

From the outside, the Saudi businessmen (including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal) who were corralled into Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton — in what Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described as an anticorruption campaign — seemed to be in a gilded cage. The reality was far more disturbing. Many were physically abused and one captive was killed, witnesses told the NYT. The Saudi government extracted billions of dollars of assets from detainees to set them free. More from Ben Hubbard, David Kirkpatrick, Kate Kelly and Mark Mazzetti of the NYT: One former detainee, forced to wear a tracking device, has sunk into depression as his business collapses. “We signed away everything,” a relative of his said. “Even the house I am in, I am not sure if it is still mine.” The net effect: Many outside investors, whom Saudi officials have hoped to woo to help transform the kingdom’s economy, are now rattled by what they say was a lack of transparency. Advertisement Of note: The roles of the accounting company PWC and the law firm Clifford Chance in the Saudi government’s takeover of MBC, a broadcaster. Elsewhere in the kingdom: Aramco is more likely to go public next year than late this year as originally expected, Michael reported yesterday. Among the issues is that much of the work in pulling off the biggest I.P.O. in history has yet to be finished. Students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School took out a full-page ad in the NYT over the weekend to thank businesses “who acted on their consciences and took positive steps for change” after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. Among the companies thanked: BlackRock, Bumble, Delta, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Gucci, Kroger, REI and Walmart. The students are looking for GoFundMe donations for their March For Our Lives on March 24 in Washington. Lots of big businesses weren’t mentioned.

T2,21-Feb-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin FEB. 21, 2018
 Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • What it takes to be a whistle-blower. • Broadcom whacks Qualcomm for raising its NXP bid. • Untangling the productivity mystery. • How Skadden got involved in the special counsel’s Russia inquiry. Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. Sigmund Freud is reputed to have said that “sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.” The Supreme Court took that approach in deciding what is required to qualify for protection from retaliation as a whistle-blower. A provision in the Dodd-Frank Act defines a “whistle-blower” as someone who provides “information relating to a violation of the securities laws to the Commission.” That seems simple enough, but the Securities and Exchange Commission made something of a hash out of the requirement by taking an expansive view in a rule aimed at protecting an employee from retaliation even if the person only reports information internally. Advertisement In Digital Realty Trust v. Somers, a former employee of Digital Realty, Paul Somers, claimed he was terminated after he reported possible securities law violations to senior management. Although he never alerted anyone outside the company, Mr. Somers filed a lawsuit claiming his termination violated the anti-retaliation provision by relying on the S.E.C.’s rule. Advertisement The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, rejected that reading of the statute. It applied a simple analysis: “Courts are not at liberty to dispense with the condition—tell the S.E.C.—Congress imposed.” By not reporting his suspicions to the S.E.C., he lost the protection afforded whistleblowers. One of the complaints expressed by companies when the S.E.C. considered the whistle-blower rules was that they did not require employees to report information to management first. The incentive created by the Digital Realty ruling is straightforward: Don’t just tell your boss about possible violations; make a beeline to the S.E.C.’s front door, at least if you want protection from retaliation. — Peter J. Henning The Dow Jones industrial average rose 139 points in the half-hour after the Federal Reserve released the minutes of its most recent policy meeting at 2 p.m. and was up more than 300 points on the day. Then the index sank 455 points in the final 90 minutes to close down 0.67 percent for the day. Why? There didn’t appear to be anything in the minutes to make investors particularly bearish or bullish. Perhaps the bond market was to blame for the plunge. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which rises as its price falls, kept climbing after the minutes came out, closing at 2.95 percent. Higher bond yields can make stocks look more expensive, prompting investors to sell. As a result, Wednesday’s mini move indicates that the tug of war between the stock and bond markets is still very much on. While we’re on the Fed minutes, it appears that the central bank’s policymakers did not spend much time discussing an indicator that is flashing a warning sign. The data point in question is the saving rate, which recently sank to a 12-year low. With the rate at 2.4 percent of disposable income, a big drop in the stock market, like the one that occurred earlier this month, could prompt consumers to cut their spending. The Fed’s policymakers did not appear overly worried about the saving rate at their last meeting, which was held before the market’s plunge. The minutes state: In connection with solid growth in consumer spending, a couple of participants noted that the household saving rate had declined to its lowest level since 2005, likely driven by buoyant consumer sentiment or expectations that the rise in household wealth would be sustained. — Peter Eavis Qualcomm defied Broadcom’s demand not to raise its takeover bid for NXP on Tuesday by increasing that offer by about 16 percent, to $127.50 a share from $110. Now Broadcom has retaliated. Broadcom shaved $3 per share off its hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm, to $79. Broadcom’s rationale is that the new NXP offer transfers value away from Qualcomm’s shareholders. From the news release: Broadcom believes that a responsible Qualcomm board could have preserved value by following ISS’s clear recommendation to work with Broadcom on the NXP transaction and negotiate the sale of Qualcomm to Broadcom. Instead Qualcomm’s board acted against the best interests of its stockholders by unilaterally transferring excessive value to NXP’s activist stockholders. Let’s take a look at the math Advertisement • Broadcom argues that Qualcomm gave up $4.10 a share, or $6.2 billion, in value to NXP shareholders. In response, it cut its price. At $79 a share, Broadcom’s current offer is just under 13 percent higher than its original offer. (Of course, other elements of Broadcom’s last bid — the $8 billion breakup fee for antitrust reasons, the ticking fee if a deal takes more than 12 months to close — still stand.) • Broadcom also contends privately that had Qualcomm agreed to start deal talks, the two of them could have held firm against NXP shareholders like Elliott Management and Soroban Capital Partners. By giving up less negotiating power to the holdout shareholders, the argument goes, Qualcomm could have recut the NXP deal at a far lower price. • Qualcomm argues privately that the $4.10 a share is nonsense, since the NXP deal a) wasn’t going to get done at $110 a share and b) will still add to its earnings per share price starting in the 2019 fiscal year. The bet on the shareholder meeting Broadcom had previously said that it would walk away if the NXP offer went above $110 a share, but now seems content to take its chances at Qualcomm’s annual shareholder meeting. Broadcom wants six seats on Qualcomm’s board. That campaign gained momentum when the proxy advisers I.S.S. and Glass Lewis recommended that Qualcomm shareholders vote for at least four of its director nominees. A Qualcomm representative didn’t have an immediate comment. How the shares moved today: Qualcomm’s were down 1.5 percent, while Broadcom’s were up slightly. Shares in NXP — the real winner in this deal saga so far — were essentially unchanged. — Michael de la Merced The deals flyaround • Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason pressed Xerox to pursue alternatives to its complicated deal with Fujifilm. (Reuters) • HNA has borrowed from the private equity firm Pacific Alliance Group, a sign that it may be struggling to raise capital from more traditional sources. (FT) 
            But might the return to full employment fuel a rebound?         FEB. 20, 2018
 An economy is doing well when companies each year manage to become more productive, or in other words, get more output from their employees and equipment. But productivity for years has grown far more slowly than it did in the past, effectively restraining economic growth. This decline has prompted economists to hunt for causes – and the latest big work on the issue comes from the McKinsey Global Institute. The Upshot’s Neil Irwin does a great job of explaining McKinsey’s main finding: The latest wrinkle is that the researchers now believe that productivity growth depends not just on the supply side of the economy — what companies produce and what technologies they use to do it — but also significantly on the demand side. That is to say, productivity advancements don’t happen in a vacuum just because technology is available. They also happen because companies need to increase production to match demand for their goods, and a shortage, either of workers or of materials, forces them to think creatively about how to do so. Little in economics is straightforward, however, and McKinsey’s deep dive prompted a couple of questions. Jaana Remes, one of the authors of the work, was kind enough to respond. Advertisement 1) In its report, McKinsey notes that the slow down in productivity growth was noticeable before the financial crisis. What caused that? And to what degree did those causes contribute to the decline in productivity growth after the financial crisis? This is important because these forces could continue to weigh on productivity. In the years leading up to 2008, the productivity improvements that started in the 1990s with the introduction of information technology were largely complete, Ms. Remes explains. Important new technologies can often take well over 10 years to have a big impact on productivity, she adds. The optimistic take, though, is that we can in the coming years expect to see big benefits as companies further automate, and introduce artificial intelligence. 2) If a sluggish economy can create the conditions for weak productivity, why did France, Spain and Italy, whose economies were anemic in the period under study, have significantly better productivity performances than faster-growing countries? First, the numbers: From 2010 to 2014, labor productivity grew by 1.4 percent a year in Spain and 1 percent in France, well in excess of the negative 0.2 percent rate for Britain and the United States. Why was that? Because Britain and the United States had made superior productivity gains before 2010. That made it harder for the two countries to notch similarly strong productivity growth in the years after the financial crisis. By contrast, France and Spain, which had made far fewer productivity gains before 2010, were able to eke out at least some afterward. Ms. Remes also points out that a big cause of Spain’s post-2010 gain came from a reduction in hours worked. That might be described as the least desirable way to bolster productivity because it implies a reduction in incomes for workers. The most economically beneficial type of productivity gain occurs when output per employee increases as hours worked grow. — Peter Eavis New research posted by France’s central bank, the Banque de France, shows that the largest companies in the United States now account for a significantly larger share of production. This dominance, the paper asserts, could allow the companies to enjoy “monopoly rents,” the term economists use to describe the subsidies companies enjoy if their business is protected in ways that are not available to other firms. “If these firms hold a dominant position in their market, they enjoy monopoly rents and have little incentive to invest in order to increase their productive capacities. This behavior could explain the weakness of investment in recent years, despite the high rates of return on capital.” David Wessel, writing for Harvard Business Review, also recently took a look at whether dominant companies are holding the economy back. — Peter Eavis The largest United States bank by assets announced that it plans to tear down its current headquarters at 270 Park Ave. and build 2.5 million square-foot modern tower in its place. Advertisement The new headquarters has yet to be designed, but it is expected, according to Bloomberg, to be between 70 and 75 stories and house 15,000 employees. The current headquarters was designed in the late 1950s for about 3,500 employees, JPMorgan said. During construction, employees will be temporarily moved 237, 245 and 277 Park Ave. and 383 and 390 Madison Ave., Bloomberg reported citing a person familiar with the matter. The tower would be the first major project under New York City’s Midtown East rezoning plan, designed to encourage office construction in the area. The job recruiting site said Wednesday that it has hired Jim Cox as its C.F.O., as part of a series of high-level executive appointments. Mr. Cox was most recently at Lithium Technologies, a maker of customer relationship management software. Here’s what Robert Hohman, Glassdoor’s C.E.O. and co-founder, said: “We are pleased to welcome Jim to Glassdoor as our new CFO as he brings a proven track record of building and managing financial operations and teams at high-growth technology companies.” Glassdoor also appointed Christian Sutherland-Wong, most recently its general manager of monetization, as its first chief operating officer, and Samantha Zupan, a longtime executive, as its vice president of global corporate communications. — Michael de la Merced The giant law firm’s work for the former Trump campaign manager — who has been charged with several criminal acts by Robert Mueller’s inquiry into Russian election interference — has come into question after a former Skadden associate entered a guilty plea in the investigation. Advertisement More from Kenneth Vogel and Andrew Kramer of the NYT: The interest from prosecutors in what Skadden did for the Ukrainian government is one indication of the wide-ranging nature of the inquiries related to Mr. Manafort. It also highlights the risks associated with advising authoritarian governments overseas, a lucrative sideline among Washington lawyers, lobbyists and public relations consultants. Skadden’s response: It fired the associate in question, Alex van der Zwaan, last year, and is cooperating with Mr. Mueller’s team. Elsewhere in Russian election meddling: Here’s what we still don’t know about Facebook’s role. Chris Hughes, a co-founder, said Facebook must do more to prevent foreign interference. President Trump blamed Barack Obama for not being tougher on Russia. And meet the  oligarch who helped fund Russia’s troll agency. The judge overseeing the Justice Department’s lawsuit to block the $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner denied AT&T’s request to see government communications about the case. He ruled that AT&T had not “made a credible showing” that the White House had singled it out for retribution. More from Cecilia Kang of the NYT: The decision puts a crimp in AT&T’s defense for its $85 billion proposed merger with Time Warner. And it is a big win for the Justice Department, which would like to avoid attention on the role of politics in its decision to stop the deal. AT&T had already agreed to take the Justice Department’s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, off the witness list — but could call him during the trial if needed.

T3,2-Mar-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin MARCH 2, 2018
 Good Friday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Would a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal really shift the 5G race? • Mrs. May’s reasonableness may not win over Europe. • Has Gary Cohn reached a breaking point? • The silver linings in President Trump’s tariff plans. • The questions BlackRock is asking gun makers. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Lawmakers have pressed the government panel that scrutinizes deals for national security concerns — known as Cfius — to take a close look at Broadcom’s hostile bid for its fellow chip maker, which includes a proxy fight to gain a majority of Qualcomm’s board seats. (The shareholder vote is scheduled for Tuesday.) Advertisement Most notable among them is Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, whose letter to Cfius raises two issues: • Whether foreign companies like Singapore’s Broadcom can gain control of American counterparts through proxy fights Advertisement • Concern that Broadcom would sell off parts of Qualcomm to win regulatory approval, disrupting the work of the main American developer of 5G wireless technology — and therefore ceding the race for a superfast internet to China The WSJ recently reported that members of Cfius have been examining the former point. It’s an interesting issue since the panel generally doesn’t get involved until a potential transaction has been submitted to it for review, and obviously, there’s nothing of the sort yet. Some officials pointed out that the panel has the jurisdiction to consider board takeovers as a form of foreign acquisition, though the article said that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin isn’t sold yet on the argument. But let’s consider the second point. The WSJ reported that some Cfius members share Mr. Cornyn’s concerns about a weakened or distracted Qualcomm falling behind Huawei of China in the 5G contest. But that ignores Qualcomm’s very public collaboration with Chinese tech companies on 5G. The American chip maker said in January that it has shared information on some of its hardware with Lenovo, Xiaomi and other Chinese companies. And last week, Qualcomm and Huawei announced that they have jointly conducted significant tests for a 5G standard. Here’s what Serge Wilenegger, a Qualcomm Wireless executive, said in the news release: “As the industry works toward the goal of commercial launches of 5G NR products and networks in 2019, close collaboration among global mobile industry leaders is necessary to validate the technologies and continue to build and improve our capabilities.” The research analyst Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein isn’t convinced by Mr. Cornyn’s point either, arguing in an investor note that Intel can also play a role in developing 5G tech and that, more importantly, Broadcom itself is very interested in the wireless standard. Broadcom has a reputation for being a cost-cutter, which Qualcomm has argued would likely stunt its ability to keep innovating. That question hasn’t been settled. But the question of whether a deal would endanger the U.S.’s role in the 5G race appears to go a bit too far. A related consideration: Cfius’s ability to review Broadcom’s moves depends on that chip maker being considered a foreign company. But shareholders of the manufacturer are scheduled to vote on moving its legal residence to the U.S. from Singapore on May 6. It’s unclear whether the panel will act before then — or if it would ultimately have to decide that it has no jurisdiction after that change in address. Advertisement — Michael de la Merced President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs are unlikely to amount to effective policymaking. They target stanch allies and ignore far greater problems in the world trading system. But there may something to salvage from the wreckage. First, on the face of it, the president seems willing to risk a stock market plunge to pursue a policy that Wall Street opposes. Too often, the disfavor of investors is taken as evidence that a policy is terrible when it might be just inconvenient to powerful interests. Second, Mr. Trump’s tariffs have kept an important debate over trade going. One hope for Mr. Trump’s administration is that its skepticism toward free trade leads to policies that help workers whose jobs are vulnerable to free trade. The proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum are unlikely to provide longer-term assistance to workers in those industries. Still, the skepticism toward free trade may now be permanent and provide future administrations with greater leeway to address its drawbacks. — Peter Eavis Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday described the highly preferential relationship her government is seeking to establish with the European Union after it leaves the bloc next year. And to win over skeptics, she attempted to make Britain’s goals seem as reasonable as possible. Her requests for a unique relationship will no doubt get short shrift from those who say Britain cannot be allowed to enjoy the benefits of trading with Europe without accepting most of the obligations. Mrs. May’s response is that both sides can benefit under a new arrangement. She said: We both want good access to each other’s markets; we want competition between us to be fair and open; and we want reliable, transparent means of verifying we are meeting our commitments and resolving disputes. But what is clear is that for us both to meet our objectives we need to look beyond the precedents, and find a new balance. And Mrs. May said Britain would not, as some fear, reduce regulation to win business from the European Union and still expect a high degree of access to the bloc’s markets. She said: But in practice we are unlikely to want to reduce our standards: not least because the British public would rightly punish any government that did so at the ballot box. The big questions: Will the European Union be willing to set up a whole new regulatory infrastructure to oversee a stand-alone trading arrangement with Britain? Why would the bloc go to such lengths when it has the clout to insist that Britain abides by its rules? What would Britain do if the European Union says no to most of what’s in Mrs. May’s speech? It would almost certainly deepen tensions within the British government between those who want a deeply entwined trading relationship with Europe and those who favor a looser one. Mrs. May, who has spent weeks trying to build a consensus in her cabinet, may then find it even harder to present a coherent position to the European Union, giving it even less reason to want to compromise. — Peter Eavis President Trump’s national economic adviser has threatened to quit before, most notably in the wake of the controversy over the violence in Charlottesville, Va. But now that Mr. Cohn apparently has been outplayed in the battle over trade, will he finally decide to depart? The former Goldman Sachs president had managed to hold off trade hard-liners like the policy adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross during previous debates on tariffs. But an exodus of like-minded White House officials diminished Mr. Cohn’s standing — and let his rivals reassert their positions. Advertisement From Damian Paletta and Josh Dawsey of the WaPo: “Gary got rolled and was entirely kept in the dark,” a person close to the White House said of Trump’s top economic adviser. Or as Mike Allen and Jonathan Swan of Axios put it: The tariffs call was also a big middle finger to economic adviser Gary Cohn, who has fought for more than one year to kill tariffs that would provoke a trade war or higher prices for consumers, a de facto tax increase. Our colleagues Mark Landler and Maggie Haberman have reported that Mr. Cohn threatened to resign if the president followed through on the tariff threat. (That cost him standing with Mr. Trump, though he seemed to regain much of his political capital, particularly after the passage of the tax overhaul.) Mr. Landler and Ms. Haberman point out that Mr. Cohn is still waiting to see if Mr. Trump actually rolls out the tariffs — a fair question, given how quickly his boss appears to switch policy positions. But if the White House does impose tariffs on imported aluminum and steel, will Mr. Cohn finally pull the trigger? On a related note, let’s talk about the resuscitation of Mr. Ross’s political fortunes: • Axios, on Jan. 21: “President Donald Trump has put Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross out to pasture,” the publication reported, noting that Mr. Ross had been criticized for falling asleep in meetings. • Axios, today: “White House staff, most of whom were in the dark about Trump’s planned tariffs announcement, are referring to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, the victor in the policy coup, as ‘Chief Ross.’” — Michael de la Merced Expect today to be rough in the markets, after President Trump doubled down this morning on his threat to impose tariffs on international steel and aluminum. S. & P. 500 futures are down in premarket trading, after falling yesterday. 
            When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore-we win big. It’s easy!         
            We must protect our country and our workers. Our steel industry is in bad shape. IF YOU DON’T HAVE STEEL, YOU DON’T HAVE A COUNTRY!         
            When a country Taxes our products coming in at, say, 50%, and we Tax the same product coming into our country at ZERO, not fair or smart. We will soon be starting RECIPROCAL TAXES so that we will charge the same thing as they charge us. $800 Billion Trade Deficit-have no choice!         The current plan: A 25 percent tariff on steel and a 10 percent one on aluminum. The winners: U.S. sellers of industrial metals, like AK Steel and U.S. Steel, whose stocks jumped yesterday; trade hard-liners like Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, Robert Lighthizer, the White House’s top trade negotiator, and Peter Navarro, its trade policy guru. The losers: Big metal consumers like Ford, G.M., Boeing and United Technologies; free-trade proponents like Gary Cohn, who has threatened to resign; many Republican lawmakers; Brazil; and Canada. Advertisement The world’s response: China could retaliate with tariffs on some U.S. goods. The E.U. could, too. Japan and Korea are hoping that, as allies, they would be exempted — but they appear prepared to fight back. The context: George W. Bush imposed tariffs on imported steel in 2002. He lifted them a year later. Peter Eavis’s take: Mr. Trump’s tariffs may be quite narrow in focus and exist for a relatively short period. Investors could learn to live with those. But the U.S. economy and stock markets have some vulnerabilities that could magnify the damage from a trade war. Goldman Sachs’s economists wrote that while the potential tariff’s on imported steel and aluminum “could alleviate political pressure on the White House to pursue other trade restrictions in the near-term,” it would increase “the probability of trade-restrictive outcomes to other pending issues.” On Nafta: “We believe the most likely outcome in the near-term is the announcement of a few small agreements on technical trade issues, but we continue to expect negotiations to stall on major issues like rules of origin and government procurement. There is a good chance that this could eventually lead the President to announce he intends to withdraw from NAFTA, but such an announcement does not appear likely in the near term, in our view.” On China’s practices regarding intellectual property and technology transfer: “We expect that the Administration will ultimately announce restrictions on investment by Chinese companies in the US, and possibly broader trade restrictions, in response to its ongoing Section 301 investigation. The deadline for that decision is not until August, however, and it is not clear when an announcement in this area will be made.” The Commerce Secretary appeared on CNBC and downplayed the impact of President Trump’s planned tariffs, using a can of Campbell Soup. “In a can of Campbell Soup, there are about 2.6 pennies worth of steel. So if that goes up by 25 percent, that’s about six-tenths of one cent on the price on a can of Campbell Soup,” Ross argued. “I just bought this can today at a 7-Eleven ... and it priced at a $1.99. Who in the world is going to be too bothered?” Not everyone agrees with that view: 
            Like most brewers, we are selling an increasing amount of our beers in aluminum cans, and this action will cause aluminum prices to rise. It is likely to lead to job losses across the beer industry. (2/3)         BlackRock, the largest investor in the world, is doubling down on pushing gun makers to consider their responsibilities to the public. BlackRock said that in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., shootings it has been speaking with public gun manufacturers and retailers. “For manufacturers and retailers of civilian firearms, we believe that responsible policies and practices are critical to their long-term prospects. Now more so than ever. That is why, over the past week, we have reached out to the major publicly traded civilian firearms manufacturers and retailers to engage in a discussion of their business practices. We have already had constructive discussions with some, and we are continuing to pursue our engagement with them all.” Blackrock said it is asking companies to answer questions like: • “What is your strategy and process for managing the reputational, financial and litigation risk associated with manufacturing civilian firearms?” • “How do you assess the financial, reputational and litigation risk of the various aspects of your product lines and how each of those products is distributed?” — Andrew Ross Sorkin An article in The Intercept says that not only did the real estate firm — which Jared Kushner led until joining the White House — try to convince Qatar to invest in its embattled 666 Fifth Avenue property in Manhattan, but that it spoke directly with the emirate’s top money man. Advertisement The meeting between Charles Kushner, Mr. Kushner’s father, and Ali Sharif Al Emadi of Qatar was last April, a month before Saudi Arabia and others set up a blockade of the emirate. Mr. Kushner supported the move, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson did not. More from Clayton Swisher and Ryan Grim of The Intercept: The 30-minute meeting, according to two sources in the financial industry who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the potential transaction, included aides to both parties, and was held at a suite at the St. Regis Hotel in New York. A follow-up meeting was held the next day in a glass-walled conference room at the Kushner property itself, though Al Emadi did not attend the second gathering in person. A Kushner Companies spokeswoman said that the company doesn’t “do business with any sovereign funds.” The context: Mr. Kushner’s family business has appeared to become more of a liability to his work in the White House. Remember that he held meetings with top financiers whose firms later lent money to Kushner Companies, which has aroused concerns. Or that several countries have reportedly discussed using his complicated financial ties as negotiating leverage over him. — Michael de la Merced Mr. Trump has long thrived on chaos as an organizing principle. But how much disorder is too much? Remember that the White House has suffered from: very public infighting; off-the-cuff policy proposals by the president; a historically high 34 percent turnover rate; officials threatening to quit to win policy arguments; and an array of investigations into advisers (including Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka) and cabinet members. Jim Stewart spoke with a number of experts for their takes on how the president has been running his White House. Here’s a taster: • Jeffrey Pfeffer of Stanford University, said of the White House’s turnover rate, “This reflects badly on his leadership.” Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . • Charles Elson of the University of Delaware said, “He isn’t bound by any traditional norms of management.” Here’s what the Federal Reserve chairman told the Senate Banking Committee: “Nothing is suggesting to me that wage inflation is at a point of accelerating. I would expect that some continued strengthening in the labor market can take place without causing inflation.” Advertisement But new data from the Commerce Department suggest the opposite: • Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE, rose 0.4 percent, the biggest increase since September. • So-called core PCE, which excludes food and energy, advanced 0.3 percent in January — the largest gain since January 2017. • Year-over-year core PCE, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, rose 1.5 percent in January.

(The company later said the latter should have been.) Advertisement More from Sapna Maheshwari and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT: The company has flagged a photo of a woman in a T-shirt reading in dim lighting, for example, while allowing a provocative image of a man’s bare stomach for an ad from a Facebook group dedicated to “steamy romance novels” called Beyond 50 Shades. That image, in which the man had his thumb on the inside of his pants, was incorrectly approved, a Facebook spokeswoman recently said.
