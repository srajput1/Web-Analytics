8-Mar,"Advertisement Supported by Square Feet New “hyperscale” data centers from the tech giants, part of a wave of global development, helped lead Prineville to a path of recovery. By Keith Schneider PRINEVILLE, ORE. — A decade ago, when five shuttered sawmills and 20 percent unemployment defined Crook County, Ore., nobody envisioned that the path to recovery would be tied to Facebook and Apple. But on the rimrock summit overlooking this city, the county seat and home to 10,000 residents, Facebook is sinking the footings for the first of two 450,000-square-foot data centers that together will cost $1 billion when completed in 2021. The immense buildings will join the four existing data centers, totaling 1.27 million square feet, that Facebook has built here since 2010 at a cost of $1.1 billion. They are among 11 centers the company has built in the United States and overseas. Nearby, Apple built its own $988 million, 660,000-square-foot data center, which the company will soon expand to one million square feet. It is one of seven built by Apple in the United States. One more is under construction in Iowa, and three others are planned in China, Denmark and Ireland, according to an Apple spokeswoman. The Facebook and Apple projects here are part of a wave of global data center construction and development, a market valued at $88 billion last year, according to Synergy Research Group, a market research firm in Reno, Nev. There’s not much architectural excitement about a data center. But the windowless, big-box buildings form the climate-controlled central nervous system of online commerce and communications. They are as essential to the basic economic infrastructure of the 21st century as iron ore mines and auto assembly plants were to the 20th. What distinguishes them is their size. Prineville’s Facebook and Apple centers are among 386 “hyperscale” data centers around the world, built and operated by the 24 biggest internet and technology companies, including Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, eBay, Microsoft and Yahoo. A study this year by Cisco, the Silicon Valley networking company, projected the number of hyperscale data centers to grow to 628 by 2021. Those centers could command more than half of all data center internet traffic. The United States accounts for more than half of all data center construction, Cisco said, followed by Asia, Western Europe and Latin America. A study in 2017 by CBRE Research found that certain metropolitan regions — Chicago, Detroit, New Jersey, New York, Northern Virginia and Silicon Valley — were the most active areas for data center construction in the United States. Like the big industrial projects of the previous century, the investments that Facebook, Apple and their competitors have made in land, buildings and equipment are considerable, typically more than $1 billion each. The centers consume prodigious amounts of electricity and water, just like factories. Property tax breaks that Oregon and other states use to lure data centers also are comparable. What is different is slim staffing. Facebook employs around 200 people here to manage buildings 1,000 feet long. Inside are aisle after aisle of computer servers networked to receive, store, stream and transmit the flood of digital bytes that steer daily life for more than two billion people. “The market is very big because the demand is huge,” said Rob Johnson, chief executive of Vertiv, a $4 billion global technology company in Columbus, Ohio, that designs, builds and supplies equipment to data centers. “Data centers serve the requirements for all the smartphones, streaming, high-definition video and all the new applications like autonomous vehicles. The technology is driving immense amounts of data and traffic.” Lucrative tax incentives are the rare area of data center development that has come under criticism. Iowa last year awarded Apple $208 million in tax breaks to build a $1.3 billion center in rural Waukee that would employ 50 people. “The big tech companies are getting huge tax breaks to build things they would build anyway,” said Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, a research group in Washington. “The cost to taxpayers is enormous for data centers that create very few permanent jobs.” Oregon’s incentive package allows both companies to avoid property taxes for 15 years, saving Facebook and Apple roughly $45 million each over that period. State law also has a sweetener for cities. Companies receiving the tax break are required to pay employees 150 percent of the median regional wage. Prineville data center workers earn at least $60,000 a year. Prineville counts 400 permanent jobs in the data centers, influencing its small-town culture, filling the municipal treasury and transforming its sagebrush and juniper landscape. Mayor Betty Roppe noted that Facebook and Apple provided Prineville with income from other municipal accounts. For instance, the city receives a 5 percent “franchise” fee on all electricity sales in its jurisdiction. Because Facebook’s and Apple’s centers consume nearly $40 million in electricity annually, total franchise fees last year reached $2.2 million, up from $340,000 in 2010. When the abatements expire midway through the 2020s, the value of Prineville’s taxable property will increase by roughly $2 billion, more than doubling the total from the $1.5 billion in property currently assessed by the city. Revenue is projected to reach $9 million annually, up from $4 million currently. “We were a cowboy and timber town,” said Steve Forrester, Prineville’s city manager and a former sawmill executive. “We went from ‘I got to go feed my cows’ to the most technically advanced companies in the world siting data centers in our little town. It freaked some people out.” Once-struggling Prineville has become a factor in turning central Oregon into a dynamic region of demographic and economic transition. It is becoming a bedroom community for Bend, 36 miles away, where the population has nearly doubled since 2000, making it the sixth-fastest-growing city in the country. The data centers also are changing the region’s electrical market. Avangrid Renewables just opened one of Oregon’s largest solar-generating stations outside Prineville, a $120 million, 56-megawatt plant to supply clean energy to Apple. Crook County authorities say they have entertained inquiries for building four more solar stations of similar size to supply data center needs. In 2009, when Ms. Roppe was a member of the City Council, she convened planning meetings with city executives to save Prineville from sawmill shutdowns and a deep recession. Her economic goals were straightforward: diversifying the economy and seeking companies willing to pay living wages. “Our unadjusted employment was 24 percent,” she said. “So we did whatever we had to do to change that.” When seven lawyers arrived in town to scout land for a company called Vitesse, she learned how competitive Prineville was to data center developers. The city and region fill all basic requirements — available land, ample electricity, access to fresh water, proximity to markets and generous tax breaks. Another advantage was cool summers — Facebook cools its data centers with fresh air. Ms. Roppe and her aides soon were made aware that Vitesse was a disguise for Facebook. The company bought 127 acres near the airport for $2.7 million and publicly revealed itself at a groundbreaking ceremony in January 2010. A year later, Apple’s scouts arrived as agents of a front company called Pillar. “We always were left guessing as to who we were dealing with,” Ms. Roppe said. In 2012, after buying 160 acres for $3.6 million, Apple started construction of its big data center. The presence of two big Silicon Valley companies once unnerved Prineville. Though most data center employees are from Crook County, young people wearing hoodies and driving late-model electric hybrid cars were a new presence in bars and on streets where cowboy hats and pickups once dominated. “There was anxiousness,” Mr. Forrester said. “The mill types were going around saying: ‘We don’t want the Mark Zuckerberg types. They’re going to ruin our town.’” Anxiety about newcomers has been replaced by relief over local business generated by the data centers, and new stress over rising housing costs. Residential and office vacancy rates are under 5 percent. “Facebook and Apple brought a lot to this community,” said Erika Vaughan, the owner of Cougar Cuts barbershop. “They are big, but they support small business.” Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS One subscription.Endless discovery.

 Few investors had more at stake in Broadcom’s $117 billion hostile takeover bid for the chip maker Qualcomm than Jerome L. Dodson, the founder and chief executive of Parnassus Investments in San Francisco, and chief portfolio manager for the Parnassus Endeavor mutual fund. Endeavor owns 8.3 million Qualcomm shares, making it one of the company’s largest shareholders. A week ago the shares were worth over $500 million and accounted for nearly 10 percent of Endeavor’s assets, a highly concentrated position. By pursuing a mix of value and socially responsible investing — avoiding companies that harm the environment, and favoring companies that treat their employees well — Mr. Dodson has emerged as one of his generation’s most successful investors. Morningstar ranks his Endeavor fund first among large capitalization blended mutual funds over 10-, five- and three-year periods. Then, this week, President Trump killed Broadcom’s takeover bid on national security grounds, and Qualcomm shares plunged. They dropped more than 5 percent on Tuesday, a $25 million hit to the Endeavor fund. Advertisement Yet when I spoke to Mr. Dodson this week, he was not only serenely unruffled by the president’s decision — he applauded it. Advertisement “There’s no doubt I would have made a quick profit if the Broadcom deal had gone through,” he said. “But as a shareholder, I voted against it.” That’s partly because, “as a citizen, I didn’t like the deal,” he said. Broadcom typically slashes costs, especially research and development, and the company said it would do exactly that if it acquired Qualcomm. “In the long run that’s not good for the country or for society,” Mr. Dodson said. He agreed with the Trump administration’s assessment that, by cutting Qualcomm’s research costs, Broadcom would be assisting Chinese rivals in the global race for dominance in 5G communications technology. But as an investor, his reasoning can pretty much be reduced to one word: Apple. Apple has traditionally been one of Qualcomm’s biggest customers, along with Samsung and every other major handset company. But the two technology giants are also embroiled in an epic battle over licensing fees for Qualcomm’s patented technology, with profound implications not only for Qualcomm’s business model and Apple’s profit margins, but for the future of wireless communication. If Qualcomm and Apple can just bury the hatchet, Mr. Dodson reasons, Qualcomm’s revenues would soar, and its stock price would climb well past Broadcom’s offering price of $79 a share. By Mr. Dodson’s reckoning, once Apple resumes paying Qualcomm, the chip maker will be worth at least $84 a share, “which is why Broadcom’s offer didn’t really engage my attention,” he said. That, however, is a big “if,” given the intractable positions both sides have staked out. At the heart of the dispute is the way Qualcomm calculates the licensing fee it charges customers, which is a percentage of the cost of the net selling price of the entire handset — and not the price of the chip. That means that Apple, a high-cost producer whose iPhone X sells for as much as $1,000, has paid much higher licensing fees than low-cost competitors using exactly the same chip set. Apple has called the arrangement an “extortion scheme.” It infuriates Apple that Qualcomm has, in effect, been subsidizing its low-cost competitors, including the very Chinese companies that Mr. Trump says he is so concerned about. Advertisement Qualcomm has countered that its intellectual property makes many of the iPhones’ distinctive features possible, features that low-cost competitors haven’t replicated, and therefore Qualcomm deserves a percentage of the cost of the entire device. Mr. Dodson made little immediate headway when he met with a delegation of top Qualcomm officials late last month and pressed his case for a settlement with Apple. The officials, including the chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, and Paul Jacobs, a Qualcomm founder and, until recently, executive chairman, visited Mr. Dodson in San Francisco to make their case against the Broadcom bid. In Mr. Dodson’s account of the meeting, he urged the Qualcomm executives to settle with Apple rather than risk alienating it as a customer over the long term. But Qualcomm officials said that Apple was demanding more than they were prepared to give and that, on an engineering level, relations with Apple remained good. They assured him that eventually they would reach a settlement, revenues would normalize and Qualcomm stock would respond.  . Still, “I’d like to see them budge” on the licensing issue, Mr. Dodson said. “I can see Apple’s point.” But if Qualcomm stopped charging Apple a percentage of the device’s cost, it would probably have to extend similar terms to all its major customers. It recently amended its agreement with Samsung without abandoning its approach to license fees. At the meeting, Qualcomm officials told Mr. Dodson they offered Apple similar terms, but Apple rejected them. A Qualcomm spokeswoman declined to comment, as did an Apple spokeswoman. Long-simmering tensions between Qualcomm and Apple reached a boiling point in 2016, when Qualcomm halted rebates it was giving Apple. Qualcomm claimed Apple had violated the terms of the rebate agreement by cooperating with South Korea’s investigation into what Samsung and others said was exclusionary conduct by Qualcomm. Apple responded by withholding the license fees it paid manufacturers of iPhones, who in turn stopped passing on the payments to Qualcomm. Lawsuits and counterclaims erupted, and Qualcomm reduced its revenue estimates by $500 million a year. While Apple has continued to buy and deploy the latest Qualcomm chips, it also reached out to a rival chip maker, Intel, which began supplying an alternative to Qualcomm’s chip for the iPhone 7. (That phone, the iPhone 8 and the X may contain either a Qualcomm or an Intel chip.) Qualcomm claims that Apple has compromised the performance of Qualcomm-equipped handsets in order to mask their superiority over the Intel-equipped phones. (Both Intel and Apple have vehemently denied the claims.) Advertisement Numerous lawsuits are now well underway in the United States, with some expected to go to trial later this year. Regulators in the European Union, Taiwan, South Korea and China have ruled that Qualcomm’s licensing practices are unlawful and have levied fines, decisions that Qualcomm is appealing. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is conducting its own investigation. While armies of patent lawyers fight over the rival claims, investors have already rendered a verdict. Qualcomm shares, after peaking at more than $80 in 2014, dropped by nearly 50 percent, hitting a low of $44 in 2016. Qualcomm’s precipitous decline is what attracted Mr. Dodson’s attention along with other so-called value investors, who look for stocks trading below their intrinsic value. He said his fund’s average cost per share for its Qualcomm position was about $56, so the fund was still ahead even after the deal collapsed this week. On Thursday, Qualcomm was trading at around $60. Still, Qualcomm’s performance has knocked the Endeavor fund from its perch at the top of the Morningstar rankings. So far this year, it’s 61st. Now that Mr. Trump has rescued Qualcomm from the imminent threat of a Broadcom takeover, its financial prospects — and share price — will largely follow the twists and turns in the Apple standoff. While Mr. Dodson remains optimistic about the outcome, that doesn’t mean he’s against all potential takeovers of Qualcomm. Last week, there were rumors that Intel might launch a bid for Broadcom, which made Mr. Dodson wonder: “Why doesn’t it bid for Qualcomm? If Intel bought it, Qualcomm would be in good hands.” “As a citizen, I’d be very comfortable with that,” he said.

 Call it cheeky, sentimental or delusional, but Paul Jacobs’s idea of making an offer for Qualcomm, the company he chaired until this month, is certainly daring. The chip maker only just wiggled out from under a takeover offer from rival Broadcom. What Qualcomm really needs is less a buyer and more a mediator. There are usually two reasons to take a company private — the idea that the new owner can run it better, or a belief that the market is valuing it wrongly. Broadcom took the first path, and pointed at Qualcomm’s paltry revenue growth and relatively low operating margins. Mr. Jacobs, whose father co-founded the company, is not the man to tackle those problems — if he were, he would have done it when he was executive chairman. Valuation is a more compelling argument. It hinges on Qualcomm’s rift with Apple. The iPhone maker is supposed to pay Qualcomm royalties on every phone sold, but has instructed its suppliers to hold back payment while it haggles with the chip maker on how those should be calculated. A simple calculation shows how important this is: At $10 per phone on 250 million devices per year, Qualcomm would make $2.5 billion in revenue a year, almost all of which would flow to the bottom line. That’s equivalent to a lump-sum value of perhaps $17 billion, assuming a tax rate of 21 percent and margins of 85 percent. If investors aren’t pricing in any Apple royalty at all right now, that’s enough to justify a price close to the $117 billion Broadcom offered. Mr. Jacobs, however, is not the right person to mend the rift with Apple. One person who could, in theory, is SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son. The Japanese investor has a longstanding relationship with Apple — and counts both Apple and Qualcomm as investors in his Vision Fund, which is also one of the financial companies Mr. Jacobs reportedly has been asking to finance a bid. Conceivably, he could help them split the difference. Would SoftBank’s founder be up for the gig? Qualcomm, as a leader in 5G, is a trophy asset, and having Mr. Jacobs on board might neutralize some of the fear of foreign ownership that destroyed Broadcom’s bid. But Qualcomm is also politically sensitive, a supplier to SoftBank already — and very big. Even with help, Qualcomm is probably too big a bite for SoftBank to chew. Mr. Jacobs, and Mr. Son for that matter, can use their daring to better effect elsewhere. John Foley is Reuters Breakingviews editor for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

 (Reuters) - Online platforms such as Google, Apple and Amazon face new European Union rules on their commercial practices with smaller businesses that use their services, as Brussels seeks to curtail their huge market power. The European Commission is drafting a new regulation specifically targeting online platforms such as e-commerce sites, app stores and search engines that will require the companies to be more transparent about how they rank search results and why they delist some services. The proposal seeks to address potentially harmful trading practices by online platforms and a lack of effective redress mechanisms for smaller businesses that use them to reach consumers. ""Online intermediation services can hold superior bargaining power over their business users, enabling them to behave unilaterally in a way that is capable of harming the businesses using them,"" the draft regulation, seen by Reuters, says. Advertisement Tech companies have faced significant regulatory pressure from Brussels, be it over their handling of swathes of user data, how much they pay in taxes or the proliferation of extremist content on social media. Advertisement The proposal was initially meant to exclude search engines such as Alphabet Inc's Google and Microsoft's Bing, but these will now be included given the impact a business's ranking in search results can have on its revenues. The EU's antitrust chief in June hit Google with a record 2.42 billion euro ($2.99 billion) fine for favoring its own shopping service over those of rivals.  . Under the proposal, operators of search engines, app stores as well as e-commerce sites such as eBay will have to specify upfront the ""most important parameters determining ranking"", such as ""specific signals incorporated into algorithms"" and adjustment or demotion mechanisms. The proposal will not force companies to disclose their algorithms but just provide descriptions at a general level explaining ""how and to what extent the relevant ranking mechanism takes account of the quality of the products and services offered"". Online platforms will also have to implement a notice period of at least 15 days for changes to their terms and conditions as well as provide businesses with an ""individualized"" description of the reasons for which they have been de-listed or suspended - for example from Apple's App Store or Google Play. Where companies have their own services competing with other businesses on their platforms - for example Google's own comparison shopping service in Google search results - their terms and conditions will have to include a description of any preferential treatment they give to their own service including access to consumer data and ranking. The proposal is expected to be published in April, after which it will have to be agreed by national governments and the European Parliament.

 (Reuters) - Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google corporate brands dropped in an annual survey while Amazon.com Inc maintained the top spot for the third consecutive year, and electric carmaker Telsa Inc rocketed higher after sending a red Roadster into space. IPhone maker Apple dropped to 29th from its previous position of No. 5, and Google dropped from 8th to No. 28. Apple had ranked No. 2 as recently as 2016, according to the annual Harris Poll Reputation Quotient poll released on Tuesday. The poll, conducted since 1999, surveyed 25,800 U.S. adults from Dec. 11 to Jan. 12 on the reputations the ""most visible"" corporate brands. John Gerzema, CEO of the Harris Poll, told Reuters in an interview that the likely reason Apple and Google fell was that they have not introduced as many attention-grabbing products as they did in past years, such as when Google rolled out free offerings like its Google Docs word processor or Google Maps and Apple's then-CEO Steve Jobs introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad. Advertisement ""Google and Apple, at this moment, are sort of in valleys,"" Gerzema said. ""We're not quite to self-driving cars yet. We're not yet seeing all the things in artificial intelligence they're going to do."" Advertisement Meanwhile, Amazon.com held on to the No. 1 spot, which it has held for five years with the exception of 2015, when it slipped to No. 2. Gerzema attributed Amazon's ranking to its expanding footprint in consumers' lives into areas like groceries via its Whole Foods acquisition. Elon Musk's Tesla climbed from No. 9 to No. 3 on the strength of sending Tesla Roadster into space aboard a SpaceX rocket - despite fleeting success delivering cars on time on earth, Gerzema said.  . ""He's a modern-day carnival barker - it's incredible,"" Gerzema said of Musk. ""This 'The Right Stuff' attitude is able to capture the public's imagination when every news headline is incredibly negative. They're filling a void of optimism."" For its part, Facebook Inc's reputation improved in the 2018 study, despite being the target of questions from U.S. lawmakers about the role of social media in Russia's efforts to influence the U.S. presidential election in 2016. Facebook ranked 51st, its best showing since 2014 when it ranked 38th, the highest the firm ever ranked in the poll. This year, film production company The Weinstein Co made its debut at 99th out of 100 on the list after more than 70 women accused co-founder Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, including rape.

 DUBLIN —  Ireland has chosen Bank of New York Mellon to administer an escrow fund of up to 15 billion euros ($18.6 billion) in disputed taxes that the European Commission ordered the government to collect from Apple. The European Commission ruled in August 2016 that Apple had received unfair tax incentives from Ireland and last October said it was taking Dublin to the European Court of Justice over delays in recovering the money. Both Apple and Dublin are appealing the original ruling, saying the iPhone maker's tax treatment was in line with Irish and European Union law. The Commission ordered Ireland to collect 13 billion euros  in back taxes, a figure Ireland's finance department estimated last year could reach 15 billion euros including EU interest. Advertisement The finance department said on Wednesday that it would finalize the operational arrangements for the escrow over the coming weeks and that a separate procurement process for investment managers was currently in progress.

  Good Monday. Here’s what we’re watching: • We’ve been parsing Warren Buffett’s annual letter to shareholders. • Stock investors beware: Inflation could soon jump. • Broadcom moves closer to striking a deal with Qualcomm, but the two remain far apart on price. • The Weinstein Company will file for bankruptcy. • Fidelity is rethinking its stock-picker system. • Businesses are reconsidering their relationships with the gun industry. • United Parcel Service has sued the European Commission after it blocked a 2013 deal for the Dutch delivery company TNT Express, which was later bought by its shipping rival FedEx. Advertisement Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Warren Buffett's annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders, released on Saturday, showed that the company had substantially increased its holdings of Apple stock. Advertisement The wager has done pretty well already. Berkshire Hathaway started gobbling up Apple stock just over a year ago. At the end of last year, its Apple position had a market value of $28.2 billion, according to the letter. The position cost Berkshire $21 billion, the letter said, which suggests a gain of $7.2 billion, or over 30 percent. The bet also outperformed a soaring stock market. In the past 12 months, Apple stock is up 31 percent, versus 17 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 index. What do the numbers say now? Apple, by some metrics, looks cheap. Its price-to-earnings ratio, a valuation yardstick that compares a company’s per-share profits to its stock price, is 15.5 times forecasted earnings for 2018. Facebook’s stock is at 26 times, Google is at 27 times, and Amazon is at a dizzying 184 times. Apple’s ratio is even smaller than the overall market’s. The bullish theory: Apple’s stock price will keep rising as investors come to see that it is undervalued. But shouldn’t investors have realized this years ago? Apple, after all, is a famous company, and investors have long been aware of its fat profit margins, its grip on consumers and its ability to generate billions of dollars of cash flow. But Apple is unimpressive in a way that often worries investors: It is a slower growing company. Google, Facebook and Amazon are all expected to increase their sales at a significantly faster clip than the 10 percent that Apple achieved in 2017. It would take a large number of additional iPhone sales, at higher prices, for Apple to have the sales growth of Google. And for premium priced products in a saturated market, generating higher sales can be tough, as weak demand for Apple’s iPhone X shows. Could investors become more bullish? It’s hard to know exactly why investors become willing to pay a lot more for certain companies. Amazon’s share price is up over 160 percent over the past two years, a period when business was strong, but not markedly stronger than investors expected. Sometimes the herd just changes its mind. And there are plenty of ways in which Apple excels. Speaking to CNBC on Monday, Mr. Buffett enthused about one. Once consumers own, say, an iPhone, they have a tendency to stay loyal to Apple products. “You are very, very, very locked in, at least psychologically and mentally, to the product you are using,” he said. — Peter Eavis With the stock market regaining much of the ground it lost after its steep sell-off earlier this month, it might seem like investors are done worrying about higher inflation. They may want to keep fretting, though. James W. Paulsen, a stock market strategist at the Leuthold Group, put out some new research on Monday that suggests that the inflation rate, 2.1 percent in January, could move a lot higher in coming months. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York calculate a metric that draws on both economic and financial data to try and assess the amount of inflation that is brewing in the economy. One version of the New York Fed’s “underlying inflation gauge” rose by 3 percent in January. Mr. Paulsen took historical data for this yardstick and found that, in the past, it was quite a good predictor of actual inflation. “Although not perfect and while the lead/lag relationship varies over time, the underlying inflation gauge has done a good job of forecasting future movements in the core inflation rate during the next 18 months,” he wrote. If this relationship holds up, inflation could be 2.6 percent by the end of this year, and 3 percent by the middle of 2019, Mr. Paulsen wrote. Of course, the relationship might break down in the near future. Advertisement Higher inflation would lead to higher bond yields (bond investors require a larger payout to protect themselves against inflation.) In turn, the higher bond yields would make stocks look more expensive (why pay up for stocks when bond payments are increasing in value?) As a result, stocks could sell off, if the yields on bellwether bonds like the 10-year Treasury note keeps spiking. On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 2.86 percent, from 2.87 percent on Friday. Stocks moved higher. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index closed up 1.2 percent and is now just 3.2 percent off the high it reached just before its plunge at the start of this month. — Peter Eavis But the two remain far apart on price. On Monday, Qualcomm’s board in a letter to Hock Tan, Broadcom’s chief executive, said the two sides have made progress addressing Qualcomm’s regulatory concerns and proposed the two companies hold a meeting that focuses on negotiating the price. From the statement accompanying the letter: The Qualcomm Board believes the meeting led to further progress toward a possible negotiated transaction on key issues other than price. The Board authorized providing Broadcom with a mark-up of Broadcom’s previously released draft merger agreement that, if agreed to by Broadcom, would resolve all issues between the two companies other than price. But Broadcom reiterated in the February 23 meeting that its reduced $79.00 per share proposal is its best and final proposal. The Qualcomm Board is unanimous in its view that each of Broadcom’s proposals, including its prior $82.00 per share proposal, materially undervalues Qualcomm, and the Board encourages Broadcom to enter into mutual due diligence and price negotiations. So what price is Qualcomm pushing for? The FT reports that “Qualcomm is insisting that Broadcom raises its offer by at least 15 percent to above $90 per share, up from its current $79 per share bid.” Republican politicians in Georgia, where Delta Air Lines is headquartered, are hitting back at the company, reports Leslie Josephs of CNBC. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle tweeted: 
            I will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA. Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back.         Rick Jeffares, a candidate for lieutenant governor and former Georgia state senator, weighed in with: 
            I stand with the NRA & support our 2nd Amendment rights. Delta Airlines is now seeking $40 MILLION TAX BREAK from the GA Legislature. I'm leading the charge to let Delta know their attack on the NRA and our 2nd Amendment is unacceptable. #StandWithJeffareshttps://t.co/YQ16VcGch2 pic.twitter.com/1x256htX9u  Writes Ms. Josephs: After its tweet announcing the end of the NRA discounts, Delta said in a statement that the “decision reflects the airline’s neutral status in the current national debate over gun control amid recent school shootings” and that it was taken “out of respect for our customers and employees on both sides.” The airline added that “it continues to support the Second Amendment.” He certainly sees the need. In his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders, Mr. Buffett said: Berkshire’s goal is to substantially increase the earnings of its non-insurance group. For that to happen, we will need to make one or more huge acquisitions. We certainly have the resources to do so. At year end Berkshire held $116.0 billion in cash. But will he have the opportunity? Mr. Buffett bemoaned the sky-high purchase prices that “proved a barrier to virtually all deals we reviewed in 2017.” Critics’ corner • Tara Lachapelle of Bloomberg Gadfly writes: “The best way Buffett can solidify his legacy is by returning to the M&A market with the same force and determination he’s always shown. He may need to pay more than he wants to, but what’s a little extra to Berkshire in the long run?” • Mr. Buffett is on the wrong side of a generational shift, writes John Foley in Breakingviews. In contrast, BlackRock and Vanguard have waded in and called for companies to do good. That attitude is already baked into the Buffett view, Mr. Foley writes, “But notions of what’s now referred to as ESG — environmental, social and governance factors — are otherwise fuzzy in Berkshire’s universe.” Advertisement Other highlights from the letter • Berkshire’s windfall of $29.6 billion from the U.S. tax overhaul was only slightly offset by $1.4 billion of tax payments on repatriated earnings. Mr. Buffett did not expand on his recent criticisms of tax cuts. Read more about what he did focus on here. • Mr. Buffett railed against a new accounting rule that will affect future quarterly and annual reports. The change requires companies to include in earnings the gains and losses on stocks they hold but have not sold. Because Berkshire holds $170 billion of stocks, the impact on Berkshire’s bottom line could be significant. Peter Eavis of The Times notes: It would indeed be notable if Berkshire started to publish “adjusted earnings,” or financial statements that exclude certain items. In last year’s annual report, Mr. Buffett criticized companies that publish adjusted earnings that leave out costs like stock awards to executives. At the annual meeting on May 5, a shareholder may want to ask why shareholders should be asked to overlook losses on stocks.

United Parcel Service has sued European antitrust regulators for a decision they made five years ago that blocked its takeover of the Dutch delivery company TNT Express, according to a record of court proceedings published on Monday. U.P.S. had pursued the TNT merger in the hope of gaining a larger presence in Europe and in emerging markets, but European officials rejected it because of concerns that the transaction would decrease competition and increase prices. The General Court of the European Union annulled the decision by European Commission regulators last year, in part because the commission had used different economic models at different times to evaluate the deal. The commission, the executive arm of the European Union, has appealed that ruling to Europe’s highest court. Facing a deadline to seek damages, U.P.S. filed a claim in December seeking 1.74 billion euros, or about $2.14 billion, plus interest, according to a notice published on Monday. U.P.S. is also seeking court costs and compensation for any taxes it may have to pay on the damage amount. U.P.S. agreed to acquire TNT in a transaction valued at $6.8 billion in March 2012, but European regulators said they would block the deal because they were worried that a merger would effectively leave the Continent’s shipping market with just two main players: U.P.S. and DHL. U.P.S. withdrew its offer in January 2013.

The group had offered to pay about $275 million for the company, plus the assumption of $225 million in debt.

 (Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Wednesday it had found a higher number of serious violations of its labor and environmental policies for suppliers, such as falsifying work hours data, as it expanded the scope of its annual audit of conditions of workers making its iPhones and other products. But the overall trend among 756 suppliers in 30 countries was toward higher compliance with Apple's code of conduct, according to a new report by the company, which has been carrying out the audits for 12 years. The latest annual supplier responsibility report includes 197 suppliers audited for the first time.Apple runs one of the largest manufacturing chains in the world, mostly factories owned by contractors. Apple said in the report that the proportion of ""low performers,"" or suppliers scoring less than 59 points on its 100-point scale, fell to 1 percent in 2017 from 3 percent in 2016 and 14 percent in 2014. ""High performers"" with scores of more than 90 rose to a record high of 59 percent from 47 percent the year before. Apple found 44 ""core violations"" of its labor rules in 2017, double the previous year. Those included three instances of employees forced to pay excessive fees for a job, a practice Apple banned in 2015. Advertisement In one case, over 700 foreign contract workers recruited from the Philippines were charged a total of $1 million to work for a supplier. Apple said it forced the supplier to repay the money. Advertisement Compliance with Apple's 60-hour work week fell to 94 percent of suppliers from 98 percent in 2016. Apple said it uncovered 38 cases of falsification of working hours data in 2017, up from nine cases the year before. When Apple finds such falsifications, it notifies the chief executive of the supplier, puts the supplier on probation until a fix is implemented and conducts reviews to make sure the fix prevents future violations. ""We’re committed to raising the bar every year across our supply chain,” Apple’s chief operating officer, Jeff Williams, said in a release.  . Apple said the increase was driven by the fact that it brought on a number of new suppliers in 2017 and started tracking the working hours data of 1.3 million supplier employees, 30 percent more than in previous years. In the report, Apple also said it was launching a women's' health initiative at its supplier plants, with a goal of reaching 1 million women by 2020. It said it had launched a program in China to train workers to become factory line leaders, who often make 20 percent to 30 percent more than line workers. On Wednesday, Apple also issued its conflict minerals report, which is required by United States securities regulators. The report lists suppliers of sensitive metals such as tin and gold. Apple said 16 smelters and refiners left its supply chain in 2017, 10 of which were dropped because they would not participate in a third-party audit of their practices. Six left of their own accord. Apple also outlined new rules on student labor after a discovery last year that some Chinese students were working more than 11 hours a day assembling the iPhone X.

 BRUSSELS —  EU antitrust authorities will decide by April 23 whether to clear iPhone maker Apple's buy of British music discovery app Shazam, the European Commission said on Thursday. Apple sought EU approval for the deal on Wednesday, according to a filing on the EU competition agency's website. The move had been expected after seven European countries including France, Italy and Spain asked the Commission to take charge of the case. The Commission, which has previously expressed concerns about big companies acquiring small but data-rich rivals, can clear the deal with or without conditions or open a four-month long investigation. Shazam, a U.K.-based app that lets users identify songs by pointing a smart phone at the audio source, would fit in with Apple's music streaming service which competes against Spotify.

 Lawrence Wright was reluctant to adapt “The Looming Tower,” his Pulitzer Prize-winning history of Al Qaeda and the run-up to 9/11. But it wasn’t lost on him that the number of deals for scripted series was rapidly increasing each year — a development that went along with the sudden rise of the streaming industry. “It became clear to me something’s going to be done, whether it’s my book or some other entity using the book without actually acknowledging it,” Mr. Wright said. “I decided I better take control of this.” Once he became serious about the project, he did not imagine it would end up at Hulu. This was in 2015, two years before Hulu won eight Emmy Awards for “The Handmaid’s Tale,” back when it was best known as a platform where viewers could stream episodes of network television shows. Mr. Wright developed the idea with the screenwriter Dan Futterman, who had written the scripts for “Capote” and “Foxcatcher,” and the filmmaker Alex Gibney, who had directed a documentary based on Mr. Wright’s 2013 book, “Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison of Belief.” Advertisement Once they had their pitch honed, they approached HBO, Netflix and Amazon, each of which had proved able to make the kind of ambitious series they were envisioning. As a courtesy, they sent word to Hulu. Advertisement Craig Erwich, the head of content at Hulu, read “The Looming Tower” soon after it was published in 2006. He even asked for a meeting with Mr. Wright in 2007, when he was an executive at Fox. Eight years later, he was a contender. “I got a phone call from the reps,” Mr. Erwich said, “and they were like, ‘Are you aware of this book “The Looming Tower”? And I was like, ‘Am I!’” When Mr. Wright, Mr. Futterman and Mr. Gibney entered Hulu’s headquarters in Santa Monica, Calif., their expectations were not high. “It was a meeting we considered discretionary,“ said Mr. Wright, 70, who goes by Larry. The author and his two collaborators sat in a tiny conference room with Mr. Erwich and Beatrice Springborn, Hulu’s head of original programming. During the meeting Mr. Erwich did not hold back his enthusiasm. “He was like a fanboy of Larry’s,” Mr. Futterman recalled. The Hulu executives surprised the “Looming Tower” team by offering them the works. A straight-to-series order, with no lengthy development process? Done. A promise not to buckle under pressure from the federal agencies who may not like how the series would portray them? Done. The biggest dollar commitment? Done. The conversation left Mr. Wright and his collaborators slightly dazed. “We walked out of that meeting and said, ‘Are we really doing this? Are we really going to do Hulu?’” Mr. Wright said. They ended up at a nearby Italian restaurant. Seated at a sidewalk table in the evening light, Mr. Wright and Mr. Gibney ordered martinis, Mr. Futterman had a Peroni, and they talked it over. “We were like, ‘Hulu? Is it growing? Is it not growing?’” Mr. Futterman recalled. “We talked about whether this was a mistake or not.” Advertisement They eventually decided that — although Hulu did not have the prestige of HBO, the subscriber base of Netflix or the global might of Amazon — it was the right place for their project. Any remaining doubts held by Mr. Wright and his collaborators were dispelled after Hulu rolled out “The Handmaid’s Tale,” which had its premiere last April to critical acclaim on its way to taking the awards for best drama series at the Emmys and the Golden Globes. Ten years after it began, Hulu was a player at last. “The Looming Tower,” a 10-episode limited series that stars Jeff Daniels and Peter Sarsgaard, makes its debut on Wednesday. Hulu will follow it up by releasing the second season of “The Handmaid’s Tale” in April and unveiling another big production, “Castle Rock,” a horror anthology series from J. J. Abrams and Stephen King, in the summer. Unlike Netflix, Hulu is available only in the United States. It has 17 million subscribers, a figure dwarfed by Netflix’s 52.8 million United States subscribers out of more than 100 million worldwide. Even with the awards and media attention it has received lately, Hulu is heading toward a future clouded with uncertainty, thanks to a tricky corporate structure and the merger mania that has taken hold of the media and entertainment industries. The company has four owners: The Walt Disney Company (30 percent), 21st Century Fox (30 percent), Comcast (30 percent) and Time Warner (10 percent). If Disney’s pending $52.4 billion acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox wins governmental approval, as is expected, Disney will own 60 percent of Hulu. The Disney-Fox deal raises the question of what will happen to Hulu, given that Disney is already developing two streaming services. Another potential issue is whether or not two of Hulu’s owners — Disney, which owns ABC, and Comcast, which owns NBC Universal — will be able to play nicely with each other after they become owners with uneven stakes in the platform.  . “It’s incredibly awkward,” said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG, a global financial services firm. “The question is which way it goes: Does Comcast buy out Disney? Or does Disney buy out Comcast?” The corporate uncertainties have come to Hulu at a time of mounting losses: It lost $920 million in 2017, according to BTIG, which projects that the business will lose $1.67 billion this year. Hulu is also facing more intense competition than ever as its rivals disrupt the entertainment industry by handing out big checks. In recent months, Netflix has signed the producers Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy to nine-figure deals; Amazon has pledged more than $200 million toward a “Lord of the Rings” series; and Apple, a newcomer in the field, is shelling out hundreds of millions to create original programming of its own. The outlook is not all bleak. According to Peter Rice, the president of 21st Century Fox, Hulu had more subscriber growth domestically than Netflix in the last two quarters of 2017. And this month, Disney signaled its commitment when its chief strategy officer, Kevin Mayer, suggested that the other streaming services now in the works at Disney would not get in Hulu’s way. “We’re very much in support of growing Hulu,” Mr. Mayer said at Recode’s Code Media conference. “It takes an investment, for sure. We’re happy to undertake that investment for the outcome, which we know is going to happen. It’s going to be a big, profitable service.” Advertisement Hulu has tried to match its rivals in courting talent aggressively. In addition to greenlighting “The Looming Tower” and “Castle Rock,” the company made a deal with George Clooney for a six-episode adaptation of “Catch-22”; signed Jason Blum, a producer of “Get Out,” for a monthly horror anthology series; brought aboard Beau Willimon, the creator of “House of Cards,” for a series starring Sean Penn about human colonization of Mars; and arranged for a reboot of the popular 1990s cartoon “Animaniacs” with Steven Spielberg and his Amblin Entertainment production company. Hulu has also built up its catalog by gaining the rights to shows like “30 Rock,” “The Golden Girls” and “This Is Us.” Its recent purchase of the 15-season library of the NBC medical drama “ER” — which had not appeared on any streaming platform since it went off the air in 2009 — prompted think pieces about the show’s surprising popularity in 2018. Hulu’s moves extended to the executive realm last May, when it hired Joel Stillerman away from AMC, where he was head of programming, and made him its chief of content. “Beginning last year, we said this was a time for Hulu to really grow up and be aggressive and be much more offensive in its approach, rather than being defensive,” Randy Freer, the chief executive of Hulu, said. The company has been fighting its way to prominence ever since it began as an answer to YouTube in 2007. “Hulu really started as, and has been for the better part of a decade, a hedge,” Mr. Freer said. “It started as a hedge against YouTube — they were going to dominate digital video. Then it was a hedge against Netflix — you didn’t want one buyer of content.” Mr. Futterman, the screenwriter, said Hulu had won “The Looming Tower” partly because of its guarantee of a speedy development, which appealed to him after his recent dealings with HBO. Mr. Futterman — who was an executive producer, along with his wife, Anya Epstein, of HBO’s “In Treatment” — said he had grown frustrated by the cable network after it tied up projects he had put together with Ms. Epstein, including a stalled adaptation of the Jennifer Egan novel “A Visit from the Goon Squad.” “I developed two projects with HBO with Anya after ‘In Treatment,’” Mr. Futterman said. “That was one of among about 200 they were developing.” After noting the promises made by Hulu, he added, “What situation would you rather be in?” To Mr. Daniels, the Emmy-winning actor who plays the F.B.I. agent John O’Neill in “The Looming Tower,” Hulu is playing in the same league as its chief rivals. “The money feels the same. The production value feels the same,” Mr. Daniels said. “You got all the trucks that a big movie does. Somebody’s spending money on this. We’re filming in, what, four or five countries? That’s not cheap.” Follow John Koblin on Twitter @koblin.

 (Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd on Thursday said it was likely to pursue smaller acquisitions of chipmakers after its failed hostile takeover bid to acquire rival Qualcomm Inc and said that its smart phone chip business would see a drop in demand this quarter from a North American customer and an increase from South Korea. Most analysts believe that the North American customer is Apple Inc, which made up a fifth of Broadcom revenue last year, and the Korean customer is Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which is ramping up production of its recently announced Galaxy S9 smart phone. Broadcom results beat expectations days after U.S. President Donald Trump blocked its $117 billion hostile bid for Qualcomm on national security concerns. The company scrapped the offer on Wednesday. Singapore-based Broadcom, however, said it would continue with its plans to redomicile to the United States, fueling expectations that the company would likely scout for smaller targets. Advertisement ""Qualcomm was clearly a unique and very large acquisition opportunity,"" Chief Financial Officer Tom Krause told investors on a conference call. ""Given the maturity of the industry, the consolidation it is seeing and our relative size now, our future acquisitions are much more likely to be funded with cash available on our balance sheet and without the need to flex the balance sheet."" Advertisement Broadcom's shares were down 1.2 percent at $264.50 in extended trading on Thursday. ""Typically, Broadcom has to make acquisitions to drive the earnings,"" said Summit Insight Group analyst Kinngai Chan. ""If the company is able to make two or three medium-size acquisitions, then I think the stock will move up again."" But Broadcom officials were still publicly smarting over the loss of the Qualcomm deal. Krause said he was ""touched"" by an Institutional Shareholder Services report Wednesday encouraging Qualcomm shareholders to cast protest ballots for Broadcom's director nominees. Krause said Broadcom believes that ""based on the vote tally as of today, the 11 Qualcomm nominees are only garnering between 15 percent to 16 percent of the outstanding shares, not necessarily something to celebrate on San Diego."" Qualcomm declined to comment on Krause's comments. Broadcom, whose WiFi chips are found in Apple Inc's iPhone and most Android phones, was eyeing Qualcomm's core baseband chips and license business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology.  . Broadcom said first-quarter smart phone results were driven by an increase in orders from a ""North American smartphone customer,"" which most analysts believe is Apple Inc, which released its flagship iPhone X later than normal last year, pushing production into the early part of this year. CEO Hock Tan said that customer's business was expected to ""trend down sharply"" in the second quarter, partially offset at Broadcom by more business for a ""next-generation flagship [phone] from a large Korean smartphone customer.""

 ___ Bids to curb health care costs offer little more than talk WASHINGTON (AP) — What began as bipartisan attempt to curb soaring health care premiums in the nation's health insurance markets is faltering in Congress. At fault are escalating demands from each party and erratic positions by President Donald Trump. Democrats want bigger federal subsidies for consumers under President Barack Obama's health care law. Republicans aim to relax its coverage requirements and win abortion restrictions. The bickering could collapse the whole effort, with each side blaming the other. ___ Trump says commerce secretary will talk tariffs with EU WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump says his commerce secretary will be talking to the European Union about tariffs that he argues have been unfair to the United States. Writing on Twitter, Trump says Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will speak with EU representatives about ""eliminating the large Tariffs and Barriers they use against the U.S.A."" The president announced last week that the United States would impose heavy tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, with some countries potentially exempted. ___ Get Started: Can't pay the IRS? You do have options NEW YORK (AP) — With a little more than five weeks until this year's tax filing deadline of April 17, many small business owners are tussling with the question, how am I going to pay my taxes? When owners haven't set aside enough money to cover their taxes, they do have options, including using savings, borrowing money or working out a payment plan with the IRS. But not filing a return because you can't pay isn't one of them. The IRS levies hefty penalties when a tax return is filed after the deadline. ___ Apple adds more 'Texture' to its services with magazine deal SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple has bought digital magazine distributor Texture to extend its subscription services beyond music and online storage. The deal announced Monday puts Apple in control of a service that is often described as a Netflix of magazines. Texture offers readers access to articles in more than 200 magazines for $10 per month, much like Netflix sells unlimited access to its video programming. Apple didn't disclose the price it is paying for Texture. Advertisement ___ Goldman Sachs CEO succession clearer with Schwartz retiring NEW YORK (AP) — Harvey Schwartz, a top executive at Goldman Sachs, is retiring next month, clearing the way for David Solomon to eventually become the next chief executive of the Wall Street firm. Schwartz and Solomon jointly hold the positions of co-chief operating officer and president. Both had been considered likely successors to Lloyd Blankfein, the current CEO. Advertisement ___ House Democrat seeks data on Trump firm donation to Treasury WASHINGTON (AP) — A senior House Democrat is asking the Trump Organization and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to provide more information on a $151,470 donation the Trump family firm turned over to the government. President Donald Trump pledged last year to donate profits from foreign government patronage at his company's properties. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., asked a Trump Organization lawyer to provide documents on the company's foreign government payments and how it calculated its donation.  . ___ China shrinks steel industry slowly, drawing Western ire BEIJING (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump's blanket tariff hike on steel and aluminum reflects American ire over a flood of low-cost exports from China, whose steel output accounts for half the world's supply. The industry swelled over the past decade to support a history-making Chinese construction boom. China has closed some steel mills but is moving too gradually to defuse American and European anger at a flood of low-cost exports. ___ US budget deficit jumped to $215.2 billion in February WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal government recorded a budget deficit of $215.2 billion in February, up significantly from a year ago as the impact of the GOP tax cuts passed in December begin to surface. The Treasury Department reports that the February deficit was 12.1 percent higher than a year ago, reflecting in part a drop of $5 billion in individual withholding taxes paid last month compared to a year ago. ___ Tech gains but industrials slide, leaving indexes mixed NEW YORK (AP) — Technology companies continue to rally Monday while industrial companies slump, leaving stock indexes mixed at the close of trading. The tech industry has led the market's recovery from its recent lows while industrials were coming off a big gain Friday. Retailers including Amazon and Starbucks also made gains. ___ The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 3.55 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,783.02. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 157.13 points, or 0.6 percent, to 25,178.61. The Nasdaq composite finished at another record high after it added 27.51 points, or 0.4 percent, to 7,588.32. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks rose 3.91 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,601.06. Benchmark U.S. crude declined 68 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $61.36 a barrel in New York.

 LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO —  Streaming music leader Spotify used its cultural cool factor to appeal to mom-and-pop investors in an unconventional presentation ahead of its April 3 stock market listing. Led by 35-year-old Chief Executive Daniel Ek, wearing jeans, white t-shirt and a dark blazer, executives said Spotify would prioritize growth over profits to fend off big rivals Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc, while also seeing a clear path to making money. Ek's team made a direct case to individual investors in a public webcast instead of a traditional closed-door road show typically used to woo institutional investors in initial public offerings (IPOs). The Stockholm-based company's stock will hit the public markets in a direct listing without traditional underwriters. It must convince investors that its business is sound and that investors who buy shares in the public market debut will not be hurt by unexpected volatility. Advertisement ""You won't see us ringing any bells or throwing any parties,"" Ek said. ""Since Spotify isn't selling any stock in the listing, we're really entirely focused on the long-term performance of the business."" Advertisement The direct listing is critical to alleviating Spotify's losses, which are driven by financing costs, and will enable all late-stage investors to convert debt holdings into equity. Spotify's revenue grew 39 percent to 4.09 billion euros ($5.04 billion) in 2017 from 2.95 billion euros in 2016, it said in a securities filing. At the same time, net financing costs of 855 million euros pushed up operating losses to 378 million euros from 349 million euros. Chief Financial Officer Barry McCarthy, the former long-serving CFO of streaming video giant Netflix Inc, said Spotify's strategy was to prioritize growth before short-term profitability, and that greater scale would enable profit margins to swell. With 71 million subscribers at the end of 2017, Spotify is the leader in streaming music. It also has 92 million users of its free, advertising-supported service, which it says delivers a constant stream of converts to its paid offering. That will keep it ahead of Apple, the company believes. Tomas Otterbeck, an equities analyst with Swedish research firm Redeye, said he was impressed by McCarthy repeating the idea that ""We are playing a market share game"" and that Spotify could reach 100 million paying subscribers by early next year. The independent service is jockeying against efforts from Apple, which has 38 million paid listeners and eschews  advertising-supported services.  . Apple, Spotify, Google and other services charge around $9.99 a month for music subscriptions. Amazon Prime service subscribers can get the music service for $7.99 a month. Ek portrayed Spotify as an underdog not tied to a major technology company, describing a strategy to be a ubiquitous music service available across phones, computers, smart speakers and car entertainment systems. Advertisement Because the company will not issue any new shares, it did not specify a listing price. Based on private transactions, it is valued at roughly $19 billion, according to Reuters calculations. It has hired brokerage Morgan Stanley to match buy and sell orders to set its opening trading price and said it will provide financial guidance to investors on March 26. STAYING AHEAD McCarthy spelled out Spotify’s long-term operating targets for generating sustained free cash flow, with annual revenue growth between 25 and 35 percent and gross margin between 30 and35 percent - ambitious for a loss-making company. Helping listeners find new bands and songs is an ""infinitely larger"" opportunity in music than so-called discovery was for video, McCarthy said, comparing Netflix’s rapid rise from mail-order DVD distribution into a streaming media service to Spotify’s audio streaming business. Spotify could devour the $28 billion, advertising-driven radio market, he said. Advertising makes up only about 10 percent of Spotify's current revenue, and McCarthy said he would be ""thrilled"" if Spotify could pull in 20 percent of its revenue from ads, although he expressed some doubt about whether the company could hit that mark. “There is an enormous pay-off for whoever wins. Now it remains to be seen whether we will win, but that's the game we are playing,"" he said.

 Call it the “Big Little Lies” effect. Within 45 minutes on Monday night, there were separate announcements that Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman, stars of the Emmy Award-winning HBO series, will serve as executive producers and stars of two new projects. Ms. Witherspoon struck a deal to adapt the best-selling novel “Little Fires Everywhere,” by Celeste Ng, as a limited series for the streaming service Hulu. Ms. Witherspoon’s production company, Hello Sunshine, initiated the project and will produce it in conjunction with Kerry Washington’s Simpson Street and ABC Signature Studios. In addition to Ms. Witherspoon, the show will star Ms. Washington, the actress best known for her work on the ABC series “Scandal.” Ms. Kidman reached an agreement with HBO with her project, a limited series called “The Undoing,” based on the novel “You Should Have Known”, by Jean Hanff Korelitz. The veteran television hitmaker David E. Kelley, who has written every episode of “Big Little Lies,” will produce the show with Ms. Kidman, along with Bruna Papandrea, Ms. Witherspoon’s former producing partner. In the year since “Big Little Lies” premiered, Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Kidman have moved a number of projects toward production, including a second season of “Big Little Lies,” for which they persuaded Meryl Streep to join the cast. Advertisement The two Oscar winners’ moves into the ranks of powerful producers have been helped along by an entertainment industry that has changed dramatically with the entry of Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and Apple into the realm of big-budget series. The streaming platforms, eager to upend the old television order, are hungry for stars and spending freely to get them. HBO must join the competition if it hopes to maintain its position as a premium cable outlet for A-list programming. Advertisement The limited-series genre has been a hit with movie stars who prefer not to be tied into programs that can last for years. It is also popular with demanding audiences that may lose patience with a show at the first sign of narrative drift. Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Kidman are also taking advantage of an industry motivated by the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements to do a better job of telling stories of strong, complex women, in a space that has long been dominated by scowling male detectives, goofy sitcom dads and tortured antiheroes. In an interview with The New York Times this year, Ms. Witherspoon said it was not until September’s Emmys ceremony — during which “Big Little Lies” won multiple awards — that her phone started ringing in earnest. “I think it just clicked in people’s minds that this works economically and critically and that it was very well received,” Ms. Witherspoon said. Amazon, Hulu and Apple all showed serious interest in “Little Fires Everywhere,” but Hulu came through with the best offer.  . The platform — which is owned jointly by the Walt Disney Company, 21st Century Fox, Comcast and Time Warner — has some wind at its back after the success of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” which became the first streaming show to win an Emmy for best series. Hulu’s guerrilla marketing efforts for “The Handmaid’s Tale,” which included sending women dressed in red cloaks to walk around New York, Los Angeles and Austin, Tex., particularly impressed Ms. Witherspoon’s team. It probably didn’t hurt that ABC Signature Studios, a co-producer of the series, is owned by Disney, which will be the majority owner of Hulu if its planned acquisition of 21st Century Fox wins government approval. Advertisement “Hulu has a rich history of transforming groundbreaking literature into groundbreaking television, and we are confident that their talented team will use this story to spur a long-overdue dialogue around race, class and what it means to be a mother,” Ms. Witherspoon said in a statement. In addition to her deals with HBO and Hulu, Ms. Witherspoon is producing three shows for Apple — a series about a morning show, with Jennifer Aniston; a drama starring Octavia Spencer; and a comedy starring Kristen Wiig. The loser in Monday night’s pair of deals is ad-supported television. None of the broadcast networks or cable channels with critically acclaimed fare, like FX or AMC, were seriously involved in the bidding for “Little Fires Everywhere” or “The Undoing.” Show creators like sending their work out into the world without commercial interruptions. In the new Hollywood — where Apple is handing out fat checks and Netflix has given huge deals to Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy — creative producers are in very high demand. All they have to do now is make binge-worthy shows.

Cineworld, which is fighting to overcome rising competition from digital streaming platforms, said admissions rose 3.5 percent, while box office revenues rose 6.4 percent with average ticket price hitting 5.33 pounds. In December, Cineworld sealed an agreement to buy larger U.S. firm Regal Entertainment - which owns 561 theatres with 7,315 screens - in a deal to create the world's second biggest movie theatre operator. The combined company is only second to U.S. industry leader AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc, giving Cineworld more scale to fight increasing competition from Netflix Inc, Apple Inc and other digital outlets.

17-Mar,"Advertisement Supported by By John Koblin Beginning next week, AT&T and the Justice Department will lock horns in court to determine if the telecommunications giant will be allowed to absorb the entertainment powerhouse Time Warner. For the better part of a year and a half, the $85.4 billion acquisition was regarded, more or less, as a fait accompli. That changed completely in November, when the Justice Department moved to block the deal. Now the talk in media circles revolves around what will happen if the acquisition is stopped and Time Warner — the owner of HBO, Warner Bros., CNN, TBS and TNT — is made an orphan. And what will it mean for the old-guard entertainment companies in the streaming age? “I think it’s important for the ecosystem, the media ecosystem, that this deal goes through,” said David Zaslav, the chief executive of Discovery. “For the first time in the history of this business you have these massive global companies — Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, Google — of a scale we’ve never seen. They’re like massive transformers. “They’re transforming this entire industry, and they’ve decided they love content, and they’re sucking it up and disrupting the current ecosystem,” Mr. Zaslav added. “In order to have to real stability, the great cable companies, mobile and satellite companies need to be able to compete with these global-scale companies.” The media industry has undergone significant change since the blockbuster deal was announced in October 2016. Rupert Murdoch, who pursued Time Warner just three and a half years ago, has gone from buyer to seller, and made a deal to hand over much of his 21st Century Fox empire to Disney for $52 billion. Discovery made a bid and has now closed on an $11.9 billion deal for Scripps Networks Interactive, the home of cable channels like HGTV and Food Network. Viacom and CBS Corporation are exploring the possibility of joining once more. All the while, digital rivals keep tossing money around. Netflix is now spending up to $8 billion a year on content, up from $6 billion in 2016. Its free cash flow could balloon to negative $4 billion this year but its market value has skyrocketed to $139 billion from roughly $54 billion since the Time Warner-AT&T deal was announced. Apple is competing directly with HBO, TBS and TNT by pouring what will soon be in excess of $1 billion into original programming, building relationships with Hollywood stars like Reese Witherspoon, Kristen Wiig, M. Night Shyamalan and Steven Spielberg. Amazon has appointed a new leader, and Hulu is beginning to find its sea legs. And even Facebook and Google’s YouTube are offering Hollywood tens of millions of dollars to buy up original content. And while Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple have opened their wallets, Time Warner has been sitting on the sidelines. “It’s bad in the sense that that’s a lost year and a half from business planning perspective,” said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal. A Time Warner spokesman said the company was “confident they would prevail at trial.” He would not speculate on what would happen should the judge, Richard Leon of the United States District Court of the District of Columbia, rule for the government. The Justice Department argues that since AT&T has such a wide distribution network (it owns DirecTV), a deal could spell disaster for consumers. AT&T has countered that costs for consumers would likely go down. Though Time Warner has been in a state of limbo for the last 18 months, analysts agree that its core businesses have been performing well. “The wheels certainly haven’t fallen off,” Mr. Wieser said. And while some think the deal being blocked will scare off potential suitors, there are many analysts who are convinced that Time Warner is too attractive to sit alone for long. For example, could HBO and Warner Bros. be sliced off and sold to companies like Apple or Amazon? The networks TNT and TBS to an entity like Viacom? “If there is a demand for other media assets, there is nothing on the scale of Time Warner anymore,” said Kannan Venkateshwar, an analyst at Barclays Capital. “That gives it a scarcity value.” Mr. Venkateshwar also pointed out that Time Warner would benefit from the new tax law, which would give the company even more runway if it has to go another year or two by itself. Another analyst, Amy Yong, at Macquarie Group, said: “You can’t really dismiss how powerful HBO is. And Warner Bros. the studio. And, even to some extent, Turner and CNN. These are great consumer brands.” HBO continues to be a juggernaut, producing hit shows like “Westworld” (which returns next month) and “Game of Thrones.” The network’s annual revenues now exceed $6 billion. It also now has five million digital subscribers, proving that it has made a steady transition into the over-the-top world. Warner Bros., propelled by the blockbusters “Wonder Woman” and “It,” had a strong year at the box office, and the studio had revenues of nearly $14 billion. And since Donald J. Trump announced his presidential run nearly three years ago, CNN has set ratings records. Still, HBO’s longtime spot in the pole position of the television industry isn’t so certain. In 2015, Netflix had 92 fewer Emmy nominations than HBO. Last year, the gap was just 20. Netflix and Amazon now spend more on content than HBO, and it could simply be a matter of time before Apple does as well. Indeed, HBO executives now speak about the network more as a high-end boutique — curators of content, they like to say — than as the free-spending New York Yankees of the industry. Warner Bros., among its slate of hits, also had several misfires, like “Justice League” and “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.” And though CNN’s revenues have grown, it hasn’t been at the rate of MSNBC and Fox News, which draw more viewers in prime time. TBS and TNT, and Turner’s slate of cable channels, continue to experience ratings declines as more consumers cut the cord. Nevertheless, the research firm MoffettNathanson has told investors that Time Warner’s upside “has been overlooked because it is tied up in deal hell.” The firm believes that if the AT&T acquisition falls apart, Time Warner could be split up and sold to the highest bidder — and perhaps even thrive as a result. “The separation of Time Warner would likely draw two distinct sets of bidders into the marketplace,” it told investors. “On the content side, we would expect to see interest from current film entertainment competitors like Sony and CBS/Viacom and even new scripted digital entrants like Apple or Amazon. As for Turner, we would think there would be interest from existing cable network operators like Viacom or Discovery.” But what would the ripples be if the deal collapses? “Let’s just say they also block the Fox-Disney acquisition for some reason, that would all of a sudden make you go, ‘Oh, there’s actually an active effort to restrain the size of business,’” Mr. Wieser said. “That’d have an effect on all industries, not just media.” Most analysts regard that outcome — both the AT&T-Time Warner and Fox-Disney deals being blocked — as unlikely, but the question becomes far more existential for Time Warner and its direct peers if the AT&T deal goes down. If they aren’t allowed to scale up to compete with Silicon Valley, how long could they be around? “You suddenly have, from scratch, for the last six or eight years, $15 billion being spent by Amazon or Netflix,” Mr. Zaslav, the Discovery chief executive, said. “That could soon be $20 or $25 billion. It’s important for the ecosystem to not allow these transformers to turn out the lights on all these important creative businesses.”    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS One subscription.Endless discovery.

 Spotify has already won over the music industry, and listeners worldwide, with an online streaming service that makes millions of songs instantly available. Now, it is ready to test its business model on Wall Street. On Wednesday, the company filed a prospectus to sell shares on the New York Stock Exchange, an indication of the imminent arrival of one of the most anticipated technology stocks in years. It was also a signal of the maturation of the streaming market that has already begun to revive the long-struggling music industry. Instead of a traditional initial public offering, Spotify will, as expected, pursue a direct listing of its shares, an unusual process in which no new stock is issued — and therefore no money is raised. However, existing investors and insiders can trade their shares on the open market. But because Spotify is eschewing Wall Street banks to manage the raising of new capital, the listing could face a rockier reception in the markets. Those banks typically spend weeks assessing investor demand for a company’s shares and try to match the amount that hits the market to ensure the shares are supported. Advertisement According to the prospectus, investors trading Spotify’s shares in private transactions have valued the company as highly as $23 billion. Spotify’s shares will be traded under the ticker symbol SPOT, but there is no indication of when that will begin. Advertisement The company, showing no shortage of ambition, said that its mission was “to unlock the potential of human creativity by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by these creators.” For the music industry, Spotify — and the streaming model it has championed — has been a powerful engine. After more than a decade of decline, the global music market began to turn around in about 2015, just as streaming began to take hold. In the United States, for example, streaming now accounts for about two-thirds of recorded music revenues, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, and streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube and SoundCloud have become the new outlets where stars develop and hits are minted. Even so, many artists remain skeptical of the streaming economy, which heavily rewards mainstream hits but has drawn complaints from other songwriters and musicians, particularly those outside the sphere of pop, who feel they are not being adequately compensated for their work. Spotify’s prospectus is the most detailed disclosure the company has given about its business. According to the filing, Spotify, which began its streaming service in Sweden in 2008 and came to the United States three years later, had nearly $5 billion in revenue in 2017, up 38.6 percent from the year before. In 2016, it had grown by 52 percent. By the end of 2017, Spotify, whose full name is Spotify Technology, had 159 million active users, including 71 million who pay for subscriptions; the rest, using the “freemium” model that has become Spotify’s marketing hallmark, get free access to music but are subjected to advertisements. As quickly as Spotify has grown, though, so have its losses. Last year, it had a net loss of $1.5 billion, up from about $650 million the year before. Its largest expense, by far, is the cost of licenses from record companies and music publishers.  . The prospectus also highlights Spotify’s successes, and its value to the music industry. Through the end of last year, the company had paid more than $10 billion in music royalties since its inception, and its “churn” — a measure of how many paying users cancel each month — has been steadily declining, to 5.5 percent in 2017 from 7.7 percent in 2015. Advertisement The largest stakes are owned by its two founders: Daniel Ek, the chief executive and the company’s public face, and Martin Lorentzon, who holds no executive position. In addition to their shares, they also have “beneficiary certificates” granting them extra voting rights. In total, Mr. Ek has 37.3 percent voting power over the company, and Mr. Lorentzon 43.1 percent, according to the prospectus. The major record labels also own minority stakes in the company, as a result of licensing deals struck over the years. Sony has the largest, with 5.7 percent; the others were not disclosed. Spotify’s major competitor is Apple, whose co-founder Steve Jobs had long disdained music subscriptions. Apple finally entered the streaming subscription business in 2015 with Apple Music, and recently said that it had 36 million paying users. But according to a recent report in The Wall Street Journal, Apple Music has been outpacing Spotify in its growth in paid subscribers in the United States. The market for public offerings has been robust so far this year. Through late February, 30 companies listed their shares publicly on markets in the United States, raising $11.4 billion from investors. That was the strongest annual start for the market since 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters. At least some of the highly valued, privately held technology companies, known as unicorns, could move quickly to capitalize on the opportunity and sell shares publicly. Last week, for instance, the online file storage company Dropbox, valued by the private markets at about $10 billion, filed paperwork to raise up to $500 million in an initial public offering. But to convert that paper wealth into actual cash at top dollar, early-stage investors, company founders and employees with stock options need receptive public markets to buy their shares. If the public investors do not think the companies are worth as much as the small number of deep-pocketed investors who dominate the private markets, it could mean the large amounts of paper wealth could be vaporized once the company’s shares start trading. That’s effectively what happened last year, when some prominent public offerings fizzled once the shares were trading publicly. Shares of Snap, the start-up behind the popular Snapchat app, surged when it went public last March, but it has since had difficulty staying above its offering price of $17 a share. And the meal-delivery start-up Blue Apron, which went public at $10 a share last June, is now trading at less than $3 a share. Advertisement Given that it involves a direct listing, Spotify’s debut on the public markets has the potential to be even more volatile. Matt Phillips contributed reporting.

 (Reuters) - Netflix Inc's 65 percent jump so far in 2018 has been so fast that Wall Street analysts earlier this week were as much as $60 behind the curve on a stock most say is a buy. The online video streamer's shares have remained well above analysts' average 12-month target for much of this year, and the gap between the actual share price and the mean target hit a two-year high earlier this week, as the graphics below show. (GRAPHIC: Binge-buying - http://reut.rs/2FpQrI4) (GRAPHIC: Netflix leaps past Wall Street - http://reut.rs/2FncVK5) Like the other FAANG technology stocks, Netflix shares have soared over the past few years, driven by subscriber growth. Advertisement While the mean 12-month price target that brokerages have on the shares of Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc, Google-owner Alphabet and Apple Inc are a little above their actual share price, in contrast the mean target for Netflix is well below its current share price. Advertisement That suggests either that shares in the video streaming pioneer are spectacularly overbought, or Wall Street's biggest names have a lot of work to do.  . Three brokerages scrambled to raise their price targets this week, with Pivotal Research raising its target by $100 to $400, while UBS raised its target by $50 to $345.

 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc is in talks to settle a patent dispute with China's Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL] and could reach an agreement in the coming weeks, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The negotiations between Qualcomm and Huawei are well along, according to the report. (http://on.wsj.com/2D5jmeD) Qualcomm declined to comment, while Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Qualcomm is fending off a $117 billion hostile takeover bid from Broadcom Ltd. Broadcom has said it would smooth Qualcomm's rocky relations with customers if it took over the San Diego mobile chipmaker, which has prompted Qualcomm to try to pre-empt those efforts by patching up customer disputes on its own. Qualcomm has been in a dispute with two major patent license customers: Apple Inc and an unnamed licensee that stopped paying royalties in April 2017. Analysts believed that licensee was Huawei. Advertisement That belief grew stronger in January when Qualcomm announced it had reached a set of agreements licensing and research agreements with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. That ruled out the South Korean Android handset maker as the mystery non-paying customer.  . During a January earnings call with investors, Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said the company was still in talks with the mystery customer, as it had been since the dispute was first disclosed. ""So on the unnamed other licensee, our practice is ... it's productive to continue with negotiations and that we don't name the licensee in the dispute. It's only when we get to the point where we feel like we've exhausted all practical activities there (that Qualcomm would name the customer), and so you should take that as we're still negotiating to see if we can resolve the dispute,"" Rosenberg told investors.

 PARIS —  Some 110 countries have agreed to work towards forming an international consensus by 2020 on how to tax digital businesses across borders, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said on Friday. Big digital companies like Google, Apple and Amazon have for years been able to exploit current rules to legally slash their tax bills in some countries, leaving other governments furious. In a report commissioned by G20 powers, the OECD said the countries had agreed to review decades-old pillars of the international tax system that the digital economy has increasingly rendered out of date. The report, which is to be presented to G20 finance ministers at a March 19-20 meeting in Buenos Aires, acknowledged their was a range of positions that would need bridging with some countries considering nothing needs to be changed. Advertisement At the heart of the issue are rules on what constitutes a sufficient presence of a company in a country to be taxed there and how profits are allocated across borders in multinational groups.  . In the absence of an international solution, some countries like India, Australia and various European countries have set out on their own to close loopholes. Advertisement Pressed by France and Germany, the European Commission is to propose next week that large companies with significant digital revenues in the European Union could face a 3 percent tax on their turnover, according to a draft proposal seen by Reuters. After meeting his German counterpart in Paris, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who has made a political priority in recovering more tax from digital companies, described the OECD report as a ""positive and important step"".

 SAN FRANCISCO —  Outsized returns delivered by Amazon.com, Netflix and other heavyweight technology stocks have made them heroes on Wall Street, but some strategists warn that investors' reliance on them exacerbates the risk of a steep downturn. Amazon's 35 percent surge in 2018 has pushed its market capitalization up to $770 billion, equivalent to 3 percent of the S&P 500 and close behind Apple's nearly 4 percent share of the index. Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet have grown their collective market value by more than 40 percent in the past year to $3 trillion, and they now account for a quarter of the Nasdaq Composite Index. (For a graphic on how FANG + Apple now accounts for a quarter of the Nasdaq click http://reut.rs/2FEUeSf) Advertisement Technology stocks have been widely viewed in recent months as a ""crowded trade,"" a situation where most investors have the same opinion, increasing the potential for a volatile selloff if sentiment changes. Advertisement ""It's a big momentum trade, investors don't care if they're paying 15 or 20 or even 50 times earnings,"" said Mike O'Rourke, Chief Market Strategist at JonesTrading. ""The problem is, once those names start giving up those gains, then the market starts to have problems."" Investors have been attracted to those stocks for good reason: Amazon's revenue ballooned 31 percent to $178 billion last year, while Netflix is expected by analysts on average to more than double its net income to $1.2 billion in 2018. An expected interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday may not have a strong effect on technology companies, which generally rely less than other kinds of companies on debt. The S&P 500 information technology index dipped by an average of 0.3 percent in the five-session period following the Fed's four most recent rate hikes, in line with S&P 500, according to Thomson Reuters data. Investors nervous about how much longer a nine-year bull market can last have favored big tech names as among the most reliable on the stock market because their business models are often viewed as disruptive and less susceptible to economic downturns, at least over the long run. The popularity of Amazon, which is pushing beyond online retail and cloud computing into supermarkets and even healthcare, has left it trading at 167 times expected earnings, up from around 100 a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. By comparison, the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings.  . ""If you ask anyone right now, if it's a business owner they'll say they're afraid of Amazon. If they're an investor, they'll tell you Amazon is going up forever,"" said Andrew Bodner, president of Double Diamond Investment Group in Parsippany, New Jersey. ""Overall, it creates more volatility for the market because everyone owns Amazon, and if Amazon goes down you'll see that reflected,"" Bodner said. Advertisement Investors' increased reliance on passively managed index funds has also contributed to the rally in technology shares because the companies' inclusion in the S&P 500 and other indexes means money will be poured into them even if they have expensive earnings multiples, O'Rourke said. Momentum for some major technology stocks is already showing signs of moderation. Facebook has fallen 5 percent after hitting a record high at the start of February, with some investors worried that people are spending less time on the social media platform. Posing a potential threat to the rally, the S&P 500 technology index is trading at a relatively expensive 18.8 times expected earnings, 12 percent above its 15-year average, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. (Graphic: Tech earnings multiples far above average - http://reut.rs/2FL29JL) While S&P 500 information technology earnings per share are expected to grow by a healthy 17.5 percent this year, that's less than last year's 20.8 percent surge and lower than the 19.5 percent earnings expansion expected for the entire S&P 500, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Technology companies may be benefiting more modestly than others from corporate tax cuts enacted this year, according to CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell. Even as the S&P 500 wavered over worries that President Donald Trump might spark a trade war, the Nasdaq on Monday closed at a record high, more than bouncing back from a deep selloff across Wall Street only a month ago. ""People are going with what works, and if tech was working before the shakeout in February, then they're going to stay in it,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.

 (Reuters) - Microchip maker Intel Corp responded to a news report that it is considering a possible bid for Broadcom Ltd by saying that it is focussed on integrating previous acquisitions, raising doubt over the idea. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Intel's competitive concern about Broadcom's attempt to buy mobile chip rival Qualcomm Inc had led it to consider a range of acquisitions in response, including a bid for Broadcom. In response to an inquiry about the Journal's report, Intel said it does not comment on ""rumours or speculation"" related to mergers and acquisitions but that it is focussed on its previous acquisitions. ""We have made important acquisitions over the past 30 months - including Mobileye and Altera - and our focus is on integrating those acquisitions and making them successful for our customers and shareholders,"" Intel said in a statement to Reuters. Intel acquired autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye last year and acquired programmable chip maker Altera in late 2015. Advertisement Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares of Broadcom rose 3.6 percent to $262.93 in after hours trade on Friday. Qualcomm and Intel each fell less than 1 percent, to $62.87 and $51.84, respectively. Advertisement Singapore-based Broadcom's $117 billion (84.49 billion pounds) bid for Qualcomm faces concerns by U.S. regulators worried about potential Chinese influence on the company and U.S. ability to influence the creation of the next generation of mobile networks, called 5G. Qualcomm has sought assurances from Broadcom over potential antitrust issues. Intel is mostly known for making chips that are the brains of personal computers and data centres, though it has made progress gaining smart phone manufacturing customers such as Apple Inc.  . If Broadcom buys Qualcomm, Intel would face a much bigger competitor, nearly equal to itself in market heft. Broadcom and Qualcomm are worth close to $100 billion each and a combination would be the biggest tech deal ever. An Intel deal would be significantly bigger, since its market capitalisation alone is nearly $240 billion. The Journal reported that Intel had been considering a Broadcom bid since late last year and was working with advisers, although the newspaper said one of its sources described a bid as unlikely given the complexity of the combination. Still, antitrust consultant Linley Gwennap said Intel likely could convince regulators to allow it to take over Broadcom, despite the size, since the companies largely make different types of microchips. VLSI Research chief Dan Hutcheson agreed. ""There's product overlap, but it's really inconsequential,"" he said.

 NEW YORK —  A long rally in technology stocks has left investors thirsting for more, but that could be a mistake as the strengthening U.S. economy points to better value in other stocks. Heavyweights like Apple, Alphabet and  Facebook have especially helped growth indexes in the past year rise more than value indexes, which right now are heavily weighted in financials. Tech so far in 2018 is the best-performing sector too, leading the recovery from the market's steep selloff in early February, with the Nasdaq hitting record highs again in recent sessions. That's reflected in the performance of major benchmarks for portfolio managers, including the Russell 1000 growth index, up 6.1 percent so far this year, compared with the Russell 1000 value index, down 0.5 percent since Dec. 31. Advertisement But some money managers are betting that trend may have gone on for too long. They argue that value stocks, which tend to have lower valuations, will look especially appealing relative to growth as the economy accelerates above its historic growth rates. Advertisement ""That growth has continued for as long as it has and as lopsided as it is doesn't mean the world has changed. It means we're overdue for the pendulum to swing back to value,"" said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors in New York. Growth and value are two classic approaches to investing, with growth investors typically searching for companies that have higher profit growth and margins, while value investors look for stocks that seem undervalued. A shift from growth to value could come slowly. Based on Thomson Reuters Lipper data, so far in 2018, U.S. fund investors have been pulling more money out of value funds than growth. CLS Investments Chief Investment Officer Rusty Vanneman, who has already shifted to favoring value over growth, said investors tend to chase performance, and ""tech names have been the glamor names."" To be sure, many tech stocks do well when the economy improves, and every sector has stocks in both value and growth. Katz thinks banks, energy and some stocks in health care, including Gilead Sciences, make good value buys right now. Helping the argument for value, some strategists say, is a robust economic expansion in the United States. The economy is also being given additional fiscal stimulus through sweeping changes to the tax law approved by Congress late last year, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate.  . Growth stocks mostly have outperformed value since the bull market began nine years ago and far outpaced them last year, when the S&P technology index rose nearly 37 percent compared with the S&P 500's gain of 19.4 percent. Advertisement In 2017, the Russell growth index rose 28.4 percent versus a gain of 10.9 percent in Russell value. ""It's definitely more difficult to find the proper risk-reward ratio in growth right now,"" said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc., an investment advisory firm, based in Toledo, Ohio. (GRAPHIC: Russell 1000 growth vs value since late 2007 - http://reut.rs/2Hy6X5v) The price-to-earnings ratio for the Russell growth index last year hit its highest since 2002.

The value index is trading at less than 15 times earnings, its lowest since 2016, according to Thomson Reuters DataStream data. (GRAPHIC: Russell 1000 growth PE vs value PE - http://reut.rs/2p8TKJS) ""It's a valuation argument. Growth has done phenomenally and the valuations reflect that,"" said Ernesto Ramos, head of quantitative equity strategy at BMO Global Asset Management. Multiples have risen ""across the board,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. But, he said, ""if everything is expensive, value offers a higher margin of safety."" Financials, which benefit from higher interest rates and would get a boost from reduced regulations that are expected under the Trump administration, have the biggest weighting in the Russell value index, accounting for about 28 percent of the index, according to Thomson Reuters data. Technology as a sector has the biggest weighting in the Russell Growth 1000 index, accounting for roughly 39 percent. JPMorgan Chase, Berkshire Hathaway, Exxon Mobil, Bank of America and Wells Fargo represent the biggest weightings in the Russell 1000 value index, while Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Facebook and Alphabet are the biggest weightings in Russell 1000 growth. Besides telecommunications, financials have the lowest valuation of any S&P 500 sector, trading at about 13.9 times forward earnings compared with technology, which has among the highest, at 19.2 times forward earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. The benchmark S&P 500 is trading at 17.3 times forward earnings. With value, ""you're basically trading tech exposure for financials exposure,"" Ramos said.

The rise came alongside a broad rally in the market. The S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose sharply - up 1.5 percent - as February's jobs report assuaged fears of inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes. The gains came nine years to the day since the bull market began. Microsoft, Apple and Amazon each rose more than 1 percent and hit or closely approached all-time highs, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index surged 1.8 percent to its own record. Those stock moves helped push the Nasdaq Composite Index up 1.4 percent to 7,532 points, which is about a third of a percent higher than its previous all-time high on Jan 26. Advertisement The Nasdaq and the S&P 500, also up about 1.4 percent, were both helped by employment data that tempered fears of faster interest rate increases. Advertisement There was no major news specifically related to the tech sector driving its gains. Netflix jumped 3.6 percent, also hitting a record high and bringing the video streaming service's gain in the past year to 65 percent.

I don't see one in the short term, and that makes me confident as a trader to go into those stocks that have been the leaders,"" said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC.  . Technology stocks have been widely viewed in recent months as a ""crowded trade,"" a situation where most investors have the same opinion, increasing the potential for a volatile selloff if sentiment changes. For example, Bank of Montreal in January launched an exchange traded fund aiming to triple the return of 10 stocks, including the so-called FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix Inc and Google parent Alphabet. Large cap active fund managers recently trimmed their relative weight in technology stocks to 1.18 times the broader market, down from 1.23 last month, giving up to discretionary stocks its position as the most crowded sector, according to a recent report from Bank of America. The Nasdaq is up 9 percent year to date, compared to a 3 percent increase in S&P 500, which has yet to recover from a February selloff sparked by fears of higher interest rates.

 (Reuters) - The U.S. government has ordered a national security review of Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd's $117 billion bid for Qualcomm Inc, in an unusual move that prompted Qualcomm to delay its March 6 shareholder meeting. The government action on Sunday highlighted growing U.S. concerns about safeguarding semiconductor technology and cast a doubt on the deal's success. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews deals for potential national security concerns, rarely reviews mergers before companies have clinched an agreement. CFIUS asked Qualcomm to postpone its shareholder meeting, scheduled for Tuesday, by 30 days. Reuters reported last week that CFIUS had begun looking at Broadcom's bid as pressure grew from politicians, including senior Republican Senator John Cornyn. ""This measure will afford CFIUS the ability to investigate fully Broadcom's proposed acquisition of Qualcomm,"" the U.S. Treasury Department, which oversees CFIUS, said in a statement. Advertisement Qualcomm said in a statement late on Monday that it was delaying its 2018 annual meeting to April 5 as a result of the CFIUS order. Advertisement Stockholders who have already voted would be able to change their votes at the meeting, it said. The semiconductor industry is locked in a race to develop chips that power so-called 5G wireless technology, allowing the transmission of data at faster speeds. San Diego-based Qualcomm has emerged as one of the biggest competitors to Chinese companies vying for market share in the sector, such as Huawei Technologies Co, making it a prized asset. A source familiar with CFIUS' thinking said that if the deal was completed, the U.S. military was concerned that within 10 years, ""there would essentially be a dominant player in all of these technologies and that's essentially Huawei, and then the American carriers would have no choice. They would just have to buy Huawei (equipment)."" Additionally, U.S. officials speaking on condition of anonymity said members of Congress and Federal Communications Commission officials were concerned that Broadcom could sell part of Qualcomm to a Chinese firm. Such a move could hurt the U.S. effort to develop 5G wireless technology because of the small existing number of suppliers that build the hardware. A CFIUS review in itself does not mean a deal will be halted. CFIUS, under former President Barack Obama and current President Donald Trump, has soured on high-tech deals, particularly involving semiconductors, or involving sensitive information about American citizens. Part of CFIUS' current concern, which is echoed in a letter Cornyn sent to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin last week, could lie in the fact that Broadcom has failed to strike a deal with Qualcomm. Instead, Broadcom has resorted to what is essentially a hostile takeover by putting forward a slate of six Broadcom nominees for Qualcomm's 11-member board. Broadcom shares closed down 1.6 percent, while Qualcomm fell 1.3 percent. Cornyn said on Monday he was glad CFIUS had decided to review the deal, noting aggression by ""international rivals, like China."" ""I support the idea that the committee on foreign investment takes a close look at that to see that American interests are protected,"" he added. Advertisement Broadcom has struggled to complete its proposed deal to buy Qualcomm as the latter has resisted, citing several concerns including the price offered and potential antitrust hurdles.  . Broadcom said on Monday that CFIUS' intervention was the result of secret moves made by Qualcomm on Jan. 29 to seek an investigation into the offer, which Qualcomm's board has said significantly undervalues the company. But Qualcomm, in a press statement, said ""Broadcom's claims that the CFIUS inquiry was a surprise to them has no basis in fact"" and that Broadcom had been interacting with CFIUS ""for weeks."" Before Broadcom disclosed its buyout offer for Qualcomm in November, Trump himself announced Broadcom's plan to shift its headquarters back to the United States after a White House meeting with Chief Executive Hock Tan. Trump praised the move at the time, calling Broadcom ""one of the really great, great companies."" Republican U.S. Senator Tom Cotton said on Monday he backed the panel's decision to delay a Qualcomm shareholder meeting, saying: ""Qualcomm's work is too important to our national security to let it fall into the hands of a foreign company."" MOVING BACK TO THE U.S. Broadcom said on Monday it is run by a board and senior management team consisting almost entirely of Americans and is largely owned by the same U.S. institutional investors that own Qualcomm. ""Broadcom continues to pursue the redomiciliation process as expeditiously as possible,"" Broadcom said. ""Upon completion of the redomiciliation, Broadcom's proposed acquisition of Qualcomm will not be a CFIUS covered transaction."" Qualcomm, which has told shareholders it is open to the merger at the right price and terms, said last week it had no intention of delaying the annual shareholder meeting. ""Qualcomm now has their excuse to postpone their critical vote, giving them some breathing room to work on its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV, attempt to make progress on their Apple Inc licensing issues, and attempt to build a stronger case for shareholders,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Advertisement Qualcomm on Monday extended its $44 billion tender offer for NXP to March 9, as it awaits clearance from China's MOFCOM, the only regulator globally required to approve the deal that has yet to do so. Qualcomm is also in a legal battle with Apple over licensing and allegations that it has not delivered on promised rebates - seen by analysts as an effort by Apple to undermine Qualcomm's strong position in mobile chips.

 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Friday said former executive chairman Paul Jacobs would not be renominated for the U.S. semiconductor company's board after Jacobs disclosed his intention to pursue a long-shot acquisition of the firm. Jacobs, the former chief executive of the world's largest mobile chipmaker and the son of its co-founder, said in a separate statement that it was ""unfortunate and disappointing"" that his fellow board members were ""attempting to remove me from the board at this time."" The board decision comes just days after U.S. President Donald Trump blocked a $117 billion hostile bid from Singapore-based rival Broadcom Ltd to acquire Qualcomm, citing national security concerns. Jacobs supported Qualcomm's resistance to Broadcom's bid, but he increasingly clashed with other members of the San Diego-based company's board, including Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf, over how Qualcomm defended itself, according to people familiar with the matter. Advertisement Qualcomm said in a statement that its board of directors met on Friday and decided that Jacobs would not be nominated for re-election at its annual meeting on March 23, and that the board would shrink to 10 members from 11. Advertisement The company did not give specific reasons for the decision but said it wanted to stay independent and continue with its business plans. Mollenkopf has outlined a plan to cut more than $1 billion in costs and boost profits to more than $7 per share by 2019 by resolving disputes with customers such as Apple. In his statement, Jacobs said he believed that Qualcomm could strengthen itself in the global chip business by going private. ""There are clear merits to exploring a path to take the company private in order to maximize the company's long-term performance, deliver superior value to all stockholders, and bolster a critical contributor to American technology,"" Jacobs said.  . Jacobs' attempt this week to put together an offer to acquire Qualcomm by reaching out to investment firms including SoftBank Group Corp's Vision Fund was a result of his disaffection, the sources said. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Qualcomm shares rose less than 1 percent to $61.15 in after hours trading following the decision on Friday, giving the company a market capitalization of around $90 billion. Without an existing company as acquirer, Jacobs is attempting to put together the largest leveraged buyout of all time, three times as large as the 2007 $45 billion buyout of Texas power utility Energy Future Holdings, which ended in bankruptcy. Jacobs holds about 1.3 million shares of Qualcomm, less than 0.1 percent of outstanding shares, according to Qualcomm's security filings. Even if SoftBank, a Japanese telecommunications group with technology investments around the world, wanted to join Jacobs' bid, it could face conflicts given its ownership of British chip designer ARM Holdings Plc, sources said on Thursday. Given that Qualcomm's board director slate faces no competition, the re-election of Qualcomm's nominees is assured. However, limited support for Qualcomm's directors could put pressure on Mollenkopf.

Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. When Michael Dell took Dell private in 2013, he had a clearly stated mission and a large stake in the company. The same can’t be said so far of Paul Jacobs. The former C.E.O. of Qualcomm and a current director told the company’s board this week that he is thinking of making a bid for Qualcomm. Advertisement Mr. Jacobs owns only a tiny slice of Qualcomm, and if his plans to take the company private gain ground, he will need a very compelling story. Advertisement Mr. Jacobs would have to offer a price that is high enough to convince shareholders to tender their shares. But the higher the price, the more debt Mr. Jacobs would have to raise to finance the deal. This is where a strong vision is important. His backers would need to see how Qualcomm’s performance might actually improve. Making that case would be tough. All the new debt piled onto Qualcomm’s balance sheet might make it harder for the company to sustain its current profit margins, not to mention its high level of research and development spending. One way forward might be for Mr. Jacobs to give an idea of how he might settle Qualcomm’s legal dispute with Apple, which was explored here by our colleague James Stewart. A settlement with Apple could unlock revenue and clear up a big area of uncertainty. Of course, shareholders will be tempted to hang on for Qualcomm to strike a deal with Apple as a public company. But Qualcomm’s stock price may already largely reflect a settlement with Apple. That means some shareholders may be happy to take, say, the $79 a share that Broadcom was offering for Qualcomm before the Trump administration nixed its bid. — Peter Eavis Qualcomm was co-founded in 1985 by Irwin Jacobs, who took the company public and grew it into a mobile chips behemoth. He later passed the baton to his son, Paul Jacobs. Now Paul Jacobs is trying to make sure that Qualcomm stays a family business. Mr. Jacobs, a Qualcomm director, sent the company’s board a letter on Tuesday saying he wanted to explore taking the chip maker private and that he intended to talk to potential funding sources about the possibility, according to people briefed on the situation who declined to be named because the discussions were confidential. The board is holding a regularly scheduled meeting on Friday where Mr. Jacobs’s move — and whether he should stay on the board — is expected to be discussed, the people said. Advertisement Any takeover attempt by Mr. Jacobs faces extraordinarily tough obstacles. As an owner of less than 1 percent of Qualcomm shares, Mr. Jacobs would have to find investors to purchase equity in a transaction, as well as bankers willing to fund debt. Since Qualcomm directors had rejected Broadcom’s $117 billion offer as inadequate, the total price tag would likely have to be higher. — Don Clark and Andrew Ross Sorkin Bear Stearns, like its peers, had an Achilles’ heel that left it particularly vulnerable to a crisis of confidence a decade ago — its heavy use of a type of borrowing known as repo. Wall Street firms still use repo markets to borrow and lend billions of dollars a day. But are they fixed? To understand why repo markets broke down in 2008, and whether they are still a big risk today, it’s important to know how they work. Repo is a type of short-term secured lending that uses securities as the collateral. Wall Street banks use the repo market to borrow billions of dollars for their own businesses and also to lend to clients. In 2008, the repo market went through something akin to a bank run. Banks had borrowed too much against the securities that backed up their repo loans. So when doubts grew about the banks’ financial standing, as well as the value of the securities used in the repo market, clients pulled trades from the banks, creating a vicious spiral that deprived the banks of a crucial source of financing. The Federal Reserve had to bail out Wall Street firms with emergency loans. To get the state of play in the repo markets, we checked in with Darrell Duffie, a finance professor at Stanford, who has followed securities markets closely since the crisis. Much has happened that should have made the repo markets stronger, he said, pointing to several improvements. Wall Street firms are borrowing less overall. After the crisis, banks had to increase their capital levels, which means they have to get more of their financing from shareholders, not potentially flighty creditors, like repo lenders. A bank doesn’t have to give back shareholder money, which makes it a far more stable source of funding than, say, short-term repo loans, which have to be rolled over frequently. Liquid assets. International rules introduced after the crisis require large banks to hold a set amount of easy-to-sell assets, like Treasury bills, that will most likely hold their value even in a crisis. These , in theory, can be sold to raise the cash needed to pay back clients withdrawing their business. Of course, an aim of the liquid asset pools is to prevent runs preemptively. Clients, knowing the bank have access to cash, will be less likely to flee. Repo cleanup.  Sudden doubts about the value of collateral — subprime mortgage securities in 2008, for instance – can cause the repo market to seize up. The amount of risky collateral in the repo market is lower than it was before the crisis. But as this page run by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows, equities, perhaps the riskiest repo asset, make up around 8 percent of volume, a not insignificant amount. Advertisement Panic on the streets of London. In the lead up to the crisis, investors who wanted to borrow more against securities could do so out of London subsidiaries of United States banks. By trading with the London subsidiaries, investors and banks could skirt a Securities and Exchange Commission rule that aims to protect customers, but may also put a tighter limit on secured borrowing. Mr. Duffie says that European rules introduced since the crisis appear to have somewhat tightened securities-based lending out of London. Have investors wised up? Mr. Duffie said, after the crisis, fund managers took the step of spreading their business over a number of Wall Street firms, rather than concentrating their trades at one bank. This, in theory, reduces the risk of one bank being hit by an investor exodus. But as time passes, employees at investment firms may become complacent. “Over time, investors tend to forget about crises, or get replaced by younger folks with no direct experience to crises,” Mr. Duffie said in an email, “The risks are theoretically known, but become less salient over time.” —Peter Eavis NEW ORLEANS — Twenty-eighteen has gotten off to a great start for the business of buying companies, and the mood at one of the most prominent M.&A. conferences around is optimistic. But look at the margins, and you’ll find some worry. To be clear, the consensus is that deal-making will keep going. Here’s what Michael Carr, one of Goldman Sachs’s global co-head of mergers, said in a presentation yesterday: “Our theory is that we are in an environment where entire industries are changing structure, and that is causing M.&A. to happen. Sometimes you have to do something because your neighbor is doing it.” Yet here are the things that people here have worried about: Politics and deals: The blocking of Broadcom’s $117 billion bid for Qualcomm has raised the specter of Washington intervening in M.&A. situations in unpredictable ways and potentially chilling deals. Leo Strine, the chief justice of Delaware’s Supreme Court, expressed concern about how the national-security review of the deal played out. “This didn’t come out of Cfius at the end of the process. That creates suspicion.” And Mr. Carr acknowledged, “The relationship between the White House and Beijing is far from great.” Macroeconomic factors: Rising interest rates and volatile stock markets can put something of a damper on deals, though few think there’s something serious to worry about. Mania: Mr. Carr acknowledged that the rush to strike takeovers could eventually lead to errors. “This is going to continue until people do stupid deals,” he said. Advertisement — Michael de la Merced From Monday, the Federal District Court in Washington will play host to a legal battle that could determine how Americans watch “Game of Thrones” and CNN: the Justice Department’s lawsuit to block AT&T’s $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner. It will also determine what kind of deals pass muster during the Trump administration. More from Brent Kendall and Drew FitzGerald of the WSJ: The ruling could affect major pending health care mergers and may have ramifications for the tech economy. If the deal is allowed, AT&T argues, it could act as a bulwark against the power of digital media giants such as Alphabet’s Google and Facebook. Or it could create an entertainment behemoth that holds consumers hostage, as the government insists. As the media analyst Amy Yong of Macquarie told Cecilia Kang of the NYT, “This court case is so important it is hard to know where to start.” Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . The presiding judge expects the trial to last six to eight weeks. The hostile takeover bid is dead, killed by President Trump. But the other major threat to Qualcomm’s business is still around — and buying chips from it. More from Jim Stewart of the NYT: Apple has traditionally been one of Qualcomm’s biggest customers, along with Samsung and every other major handset company. But the two technology giants are also embroiled in an epic battle over licensing fees for Qualcomm’s patented technology, with profound implications not only for Qualcomm’s business model and Apple’s profit margins, but for the future of wireless communication. The Qualcomm talker: At the Corporate Law Institute in New Orleans, a top forum for deal-makers, Leo Strine, the chief justice of Delaware’s Supreme Court, had this to say about the blocking of Broadcom’s bid (via Michael): “This didn’t come out of Cfius at the end of the process. That creates suspicion.” Other Qualcomm news: The company’s former chairman Paul Jacobs has spoken with investors — including SoftBank, where Qualcomm is an investor in the Vision Fund — about taking the company private, unnamed sources tell the FT. And Hock Tan, Broadcom’s C.E.O., was confident of  prevailing in Washington because of his November meeting with Mr. Trump. Toys “R” Us’s private equity backers had saddled it with $5 billion of debt. That classic buyout strategy might not work so well in the digital era, when spending on interest payments rather than innovation can mean handing your customers to Amazon.

 NEW YORK — Wall Street's major indexes fell on Tuesday as the dismissal of U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the possibility of additional U.S. import tariffs against China dragged down stocks across sectors. President Donald Trump fired Tillerson after a series of public rifts over issues including North Korea and Russia. Trump has appointed CIA Director Mike Pompeo, seen as loyal to the president, to replace Tillerson. To lead the CIA, the president has tapped Gina Haspel, the agency's deputy director. ""Any time there's change, investors get nervous,"" said John Carey, portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. ""They have to go back to the drawing board to figure out what the implications might be."" Still, Carey said, at least the nominees to lead the State Department and the CIA are familiar names. Advertisement ""I don't think either change will be troubling to the market as people reflect on the qualifications of the people stepping into the roles,"" he said. Advertisement U.S. stocks added to losses after Politico reported that a package of tariffs targeting $30 billion a year in Chinese imports could be rolled out as soon as next week. ""This may be upsetting the apple cart,"" said Bryan Novak, senior managing director at Astor Investment Management in Chicago. ""When you look at tariffs, you don't just look in a vacuum. You look at what follows on top of (them). It's worth watching a bit more, to see the follow-through on our side and their side, but there could be some anxiety around it."" The markets had opened higher after data showed U.S. consumer price growth slowed in February, an indication that an anticipated pickup in inflation probably will be only gradual. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 171.58 points, or 0.68 percent, to 25,007.03, the S&P 500 lost 17.71 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,765.31 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 77.31 points, or 1.02 percent, to 7,511.01.  . Tech and financial stocks were the biggest laggards among the S&P 500's 11 major sectors. Shares of Microsoft Corp, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc fell between 1.5 percent and 2.4 percent. ""Technology rallied hard yesterday and last week, and there is profit-taking, but it's just a short-term pressure,"" said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities in New York. Financial stocks were weighed as U.S. Treasury yields fell in response to the CPI data and Tillerson's exit. Among individual stocks, General Electric Co fell 4.4 percent after J.P. Morgan cut its price target on the stock to $11 from $14, saying the industrial conglomerate was not a ""safety stock"" in a volatile market. Advertisement Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.55-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 43 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 180 new highs and 24 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.89 billion shares, compared to the 7.13 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

 VALENCIA, Venezuela/CARACAS —  When Colgate-Palmolive Co's Venezuelan unit in January raised the price of laundry detergent to keep up with inflation that hit 85 percent the month before, it drew a swift rebuke from the government of President Nicolas Maduro, which demanded a nearly 90 percent price cut. Price control agency Sundde ordered a reduction of the price of a one-liter container of Vel Rosa detergent to the equivalent of $0.16 from $1.40, according to union leaders and company employees. In response, Colgate shut the plant that produces it, according to a Feb. 2 letter to Sundde seen by Reuters, saying that operations would be unsustainable on those terms. When it resumed production a week later after a meeting with Sundde, the results were precisely the opposite of what authorities had sought: Colgate had halved its standard container size for Vel Rosa and was selling it for the equivalent of $0.83, the sources said - effectively raising the price by 19 percent. Advertisement The incident highlights how multinational companies in Venezuela have become more aggressive in pushing back against the socialist government's demands that they sell goods at below production costs as the country struggles under hyperinflation and deepening recession. Advertisement Similar pricing disputes since the start of the year have involved companies including Nestle and Mexican bottler and retailer Femsa, according to company employees, as Maduro seeks to stem annual inflation that has unofficially topped 4,000 percent. The disputes threaten to worsen long-running tensions between the government and the multinationals, and illustrate the difficulty of maintaining a presence in Venezuela in the hopes of a big rebound under a future government. Thousands of companies across the country have slowed production and at least 20 percent have stopped operating for lack of raw materials or customers, according to the most recent survey by industry association Conindustria. Foreign companies, betting on the possibility of an eventual recovery, are maintaining minimal operations with skeleton workforces that in some cases show up only to eat at company cafeterias. Colgate and Sundde did not respond to requests for comment. 'SLASH PRICES' Venezuela's price controls have created tensions with foreign companies since their 2003 introduction by late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, but in those days most disputes were resolved quietly through discrete price increases to compensate for inflation.  . Maduro, facing uncontrolled inflation, began the year by ordering supermarkets to roll prices back to December levels, a demand reinforced by Sundde inspectors. Around the same time, Nestle announced that its plant that produces a snack known as compote - pureed fruit such as apple, pear or peach mixed with cereal - stopped operating for lack of raw materials. Union leaders say Nestle has chosen not to import raw materials because it is under orders to sell compote for a quarter of what it had typically fetched in supermarkets. Advertisement The plant remains closed. ""Nestle Venezuela always complies with local laws, and is respecting the pricing regulations in all our operations,"" Nestle wrote in statement in response to questions. ""We are determined to maintain our operations in the country and to continue to support the local communities where we operate."" Mexico's Femsa, which bottles and distributes Coca-Cola in Venezuela, was ordered by Sundde to stop increasing soft drink prices - even though they have not been historically covered by price controls, according to two union members who asked not to be identified. ""The company would not accept regulations on the price of soft drinks,"" said one of the sources. ""They said they would shut down if the prices were regulated."" Femsa instead agreed to stop increasing the price of bottled water, which is covered by price regulations, while it continues to raise soft drink prices, the sources said. Femsa did not respond to a request for comment. (Additional reporting and writing by Brian Ellsworth; Editing by Christian Plumb and Steve Orlofsky) We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

 NEW YORK —  It wasn't so long ago that zombies, and ""The Walking Dead,"" were all the rage. This week's ratings show how that's faded. The latest episode of the AMC series was seen by 6.82 million viewers on Sunday, the drama's smallest audience since 2012. For the youthful 18-to-49-year-old demographic, it was the worst showing since 2010. ""The Walking Dead"" this week competed directly against the Oscars, which themselves had a record low viewership. The first night ratings are also hurt by the same factors affecting television in general; viewers are increasingly finding different ways to watch. For example, in 2014 AMC found that three-quarters of viewers watched the show on live TV or on DVRs. Three years later, that number was down to 55 percent, with the rest watching streams online or through devices like Roku or Apple TV, and those people don't appear in the Nielsen company's weekly measurement. ""The Walking Dead"" is still television's most popular drama among young viewers for the sixth season in a row, and no other drama has ever done that for more than four, AMC said. Advertisement Still, it's hard to deny that the numbers illustrate a marked decline in the show's decline in popularity. Advertisement Meanwhile, the Academy Awards have their own issues to talk about. It was the first time that the Oscars, seen Sunday by 26.5 million people, had ever had an audience smaller than 30 million. The relative unpopularity of the movies being honored surely had an impact. Conservative commentators claim that political messages from Hollywood figures made a difference, too. ABC won the week in prime time behind the Oscars, averaging 7.6 million viewers.

DEALBOOK
FEB. 19, 2018
 For the past year, chief executives have often talked about the new sense of moral responsibility that corporations have to help their communities and confront social challenges even when Washington won’t. In the aftermath of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 students and staff members — and at a time when Washington shows little interest in limiting the sales of assault weapons — there’s a real opportunity for the business community to fill the void and prove that all that talk about moral responsibility isn’t hollow. Here’s an idea. What if the finance industry — credit card companies like Visa, Mastercard and American Express; credit card processors like First Data; and banks like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo — were to effectively set new rules for the sales of guns in America? Collectively, they have more leverage over the gun industry than any lawmaker. And it wouldn’t be hard for them to take a stand. Advertisement PayPal, Square, Stripe and Apple Pay announced years ago that they would not allow their services to be used for the sale of firearms. Advertisement “We do not believe permitting the sale of firearms on our platform is consistent with our values or in the best interests of our customers,” a spokesman for Square told me. The big financial firms don’t even have to go that far. For example, Visa, which published a 71-page paper in 2016 espousing its “corporate responsibility,” could easily change its terms of service to say that it won’t do business with retailers that sell assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks, which make semiautomatic rifles fire faster. (Even the National Rifle Association has said it would support tighter restrictions on bump stocks.) If Mastercard were to do the same, assault weapons would be eliminated from virtually every firearms store in America because otherwise the sellers would be cut off from the credit card system. There is precedent for credit card issuers to ban the purchase of completely legal products. Just this month, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America banned the use of their cards to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. To be clear: Those three banks won’t let you use your credit card to buy Bitcoin, but they will happily let you use it to buy an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle — the same kind of gun used in mass shootings in Parkland; Newtown, Conn.; San Bernardino, Calif.; Las Vegas; and Sutherland Springs, Tex. Visa, oddly enough, is the card of choice of the N.R.A.: There is actually an N.R.A.-branded Visa card issued by First Bankcard, a division of First National Bank of Omaha. And Mastercard proudly announced last year that it was the branded card for Cabela’s, an outdoor gear megastore with a seemingly limitless assault-weapon catalog. Visa spokesmen did not reply to several emails seeking comment. A spokesman for Mastercard sent a boilerplate statement that expressed “disgust with recent events, including last week in Florida.” Advertisement “Our payments network is governed by standards that have been established over time,” the statement said. “Chief among these is that we do not and will not permit merchants to engage in unlawful activity on our network.” He said the company would continue to talk to customers and lawmakers about its policies. If Visa and Mastercard are unwilling to act on this issue, the credit card processors and banks that issue credit cards could try. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, which issues credit cards and owns a payment processor, has talked about how he and his bank have “a moral obligation but also a deeply vested interest” in helping “solve pressing societal challenges.” This is your chance, Mr. Dimon. And here’s a variation on the same theme: What if the payment processing industry’s biggest customers — companies like McDonald’s, Starbucks, Apple, Amazon, AT&T, CVS and others that regularly talk about “social responsibility” — collectively pressured the industry to do it? There’s a chance that some of the payment processors would stop handling gun sales. Perhaps their voices would help push one of the banks to step out and lead? Is all of this a pipe dream? Maybe, but I spent the last 72 hours calling and emailing a handful of chief executives to discuss these ideas. None wanted to speak on the record, because it’s a hot-button topic. But all applauded the idea and some said they had already been thinking about it. A few, I discovered later, called their peers to begin a conversation. At least two executives said a reason that they haven’t been more outspoken yet is that they fear reprisals from the N.R.A. and other gun supporters — not just in the form of boycotts that could affect their bottom line, but also actions that could imperil the safety of their employees. Obviously there would be opposition. When Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal, was asked at a conference about his former company’s decision to not do business with firearms merchants, he made his displeasure clear. “No, I wouldn’t be doing that if I was still running it,” said Mr. Thiel, who left the company years ago and is a supporter of President Trump.  . Perhaps the biggest stumbling block to an approach like this are companies like Walmart, which has huge sway over the financial industry. While Walmart stopped selling assault rifles in 2015, it might look askance at any policy by a bank issuer or credit card company to limit the kinds of products it sells. Critics of using the finance industry to influence gun sales might argue that such a move would be discriminatory against gun retailers. But gun sellers are not a protected class, like age, race, gender, religion or even political affiliation. This would be a strictly commercial decision. Another critique is that it is impossible to prevent every shooting, no matter how guns are restricted. And the banks’ actions would affect millions of their own law-abiding customers, effectively dictating what they can and cannot buy. Advertisement The most troubling aspect of having the finance industry try to restrict gun sales is that it would push the most dangerous guns into an untraceable world where sales would depend on cash. That’s true. All things considered, though, it would make it considerably harder to even find such guns. There are other sectors of the finance industry that could step up. For example, Lloyd’s of London is the favored insurance company for gun shows. It could pull out. None of this is a panacea. But it’s a start. It takes leadership and courage — exactly what these executives say they have. If they don’t want to back up their words with actions, the next time there’s a school shooting that prompts a conversation about gun companies, it should also include the financial complex that supports them.

 SHANGHAI —  U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc, blocked this week from a takeover bid amid national security fears, was already walking a Pacific tightrope: it has government and defense contracts in America, but two-thirds of its revenue comes from China. U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday halted microchip maker Broadcom Ltd's $117 billion takeover of Qualcomm over concerns it would give China the upper hand in the next generation of mobile communications, forcing the Singapore-based firm to drop its bid. The move illustrated the awkward position of Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego. In the United States, it has government and defense contracts and is seen as a ""trusted"" supplier. In China, it has its most lucrative market, thanks to patent licensing fees it receives there from smartphone vendors including Apple Inc, Samsung and Xiaomi. (GRAPHIC: Broadcom, Qualcomm global footprint - http://tmsnrt.rs/2FIS93) On top of that, China, the United States and Europe are racing to develop the next generation of wireless data network, called 5G, for mobile phones and increasingly connected devices. Whoever controls the technology will gain a potential strategic advantage, and the U.S. government does not want to have to rely on Chinese-made gear. Advertisement The result is a delicate balancing act to navigate trade disputes and political tensions between Beijing and Washington that could irk policymakers and regulators on both sides, hurting business and deals. Advertisement ""We see ourselves as part of the China semiconductor system,"" Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm President told Reuters at a Beijing event in January. ""It's very clear that 5G is important to the United States of America. It's important for China."" Qualcomm is still waiting for Chinese approval of its proposed $44 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV and trying to mend its relationship with Chinese customers after paying a fine of nearly $1 billion for anti-competitive practices in 2015. The company is helping Chinese firms ZTE and China Mobile develop 5G technology and is involved in China's 5G standard development trials. It has similar partnerships in the U.S. and Europe. GAINING AN ADVANTAGE The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which vets acquisitions of U.S. corporations by foreign companies, said the Broadcom takeover risked weakening Qualcomm, which would boost China in the 5G race. A Broadcom takeover could see the company cut research and development spending by Qualcomm or sell strategically important parts of the company to other buyers, including those in China, officials and analysts said. As such concerns emerged, Broadcom immediately jumped into action, pledging to invest in Qualcomm's 5G technology and accelerate its move to the United States. But the plan didn't go down well with CFIUS. The clash marked a sharp fall from grace for Broadcom, whose chief executive, Hock Tan, Trump welcomed to the White House last year to announce a plan to move its headquarters to the United States. At the time, Trump called it ""one of the really great, great companies.""  . Led by Tan, a Harvard-educated Malaysian entrepreneur, Broadcom grew largely through acquisitions. Tan is an aggressive dealmaker and built the $100 billion chip giant up from a business worth just $3.5 billion in 2009. Advertisement Until the Qualcomm bid, its biggest deal had been the $37 billion acquisition of Irvine, California-based Broadcom, where the company, called Avago Technologies at the time, got its current name. COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP Qualcomm executives acknowledge the tricky relationship the firm has in China, especially with local companies like Huawei, which is spearheading China's 5G push. ""Our relationship with Huawei is complex; I don't know if there's a good word for it,"" Amon said in Beijing in January, adding that the company was a big supplier to Huawei while also being a competitor with Huawei's semiconductor business. Although Huawei is in a strong position to supply 5G network equipment to carriers in many large markets - with the notable exception of the United States - it still has to license some technologies from Qualcomm, which owns more 5G patents than any other company in the world. Keeping Chinese relationships on track is key for Qualcomm as domestic smartphone makers like Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi gain prominence and as broader U.S.-China trade tensions rise. Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports and will target the technology and telecommunications sectors, two people who had discussed the issue with the Trump administration told Reuters. ""I would imagine relationships that we have in China, and probably the symbiosis of that relationship, it will play a very strong role with the (Chinese) regulators' view of the future of Qualcomm,"" Amon said in January. And the Broadcom takeover case highlights a growing risk for U.S. companies in China. ""It's an unenviable position because they are pretty dependent on China,"" said Andrew Gilholm, director of analysis for China and North Asia at risk consultancy Control Risks, referring to Qualcomm. ""They are an extreme case but as more and more sectors become effectively considered 'strategic' from a comprehensive national security perspective, more and more companies are facing this kind of squeeze between the U.S. and China.""

12-Mar-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin MARCH 12, 2018
 Good Monday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Trump puts an end to Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm. • David Solomon is Goldman Sachs’s heir apparent. • Can Solomon get Goldman playing a new tune? • Apple agrees to buy Texture. • Short Netflix • Dropbox unveils its I.P.O. target. Get this in your inbox every morning. Sign up here. President Trump on Monday blocked Broadcom’s bid for the chip maker Qualcomm, citing national security concerns. In a presidential order, Mr. Trump said “there is credible evidence” that led him to believe Singapore-based Broadcom’s control of Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, “might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.” Advertisement The extraordinary action by the president underscored the more forceful and protectionist action his administration has taken in recent weeks to protect American companies and ward off foreign investment in the United States. It followed an intervention this month by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which typically works behind closed doors and reviews deals only after they are announced, to stall the deal because of national security concerns. Advertisement From President Trump’s order: (a) There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that Broadcom Limited, a limited company organized under the laws of Singapore (Broadcom), along with its partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates, including Broadcom Corporation, a California corporation, and Broadcom Cayman L.P., a Cayman Islands limited partnership, and their partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates (together, the Purchaser), through exercising control of Qualcomm Incorporated (Qualcomm), a Delaware corporation, might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States; and (b) Provisions of law, other than section 721 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), do not, in my judgment, provide adequate and appropriate authority for me to protect the national security in this matter. Further down (e) The Purchaser and Qualcomm shall immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover. Immediately upon completion of all steps necessary to terminate the proposed takeover of Qualcomm, the Purchaser and Qualcomm shall certify in writing to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) that such termination has been effected in accordance with this order and that all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the proposed takeover of Qualcomm have been completed. Most C.E.O.s have to go to work each day and grind out better margins in highly competitive businesses that taxpayers won’t bail out if they blow up. This is now the fate that awaits the next C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs. In apparently priming David M. Solomon for the job, Goldman seems to be signaling that, even if trading revenue revives after some difficult quarters, it intends to press on with its efforts to bolster its nontrading businesses, like lending to corporations and consumers. Mr. Solomon, after a successful run as the head of Goldman’s powerful deal-making business, embodies in many ways the bank’s hopes to be far more than a high-octane trading shop. Of course, if the Trump administration guts Wall Street regulations, particularly the Volcker Rule, Goldman may be tempted to pile back into trading. But the bank’s recent track record in trading suggests that would not be a good idea. Not only does Goldman’s business that trades bonds, derivatives, currencies and commodities bounce around too much for shareholders’ tastes, it is opaque. Bank executives are often loath to talk in detail when it underperforms. Goldman also made strategic mistakes in this business in recent years. It focused too heavily on hedge fund clients, something it is trying to fix by reaching out to different types of customers. Its commodities business, which it clung to in the face of political pressure, has been a drawn out disappointment. And Wall Street traders ought not to get too excited about the prospects of deregulation. As some rules get loosened, others may get toughened up, like those that would liquidate a troubled Wall Street firm rather than bail it out. While the government may not be winding down any large banks anytime soon, the diminished likelihood of bailouts can force up the cost of borrowing for firms like Goldman. This, in turn, may steer them away from riskier businesses like trading. Investors still seem to doubt Goldman’s desire to adapt to a much more ordinary future. This is revealed in a comparison of Goldman and its rival, Morgan Stanley. Advertisement Goldman’s return on shareholder equity, a closely watched metric that quantifies the profits generated on shareholders’ money, has been higher than that of Morgan Stanley in recent years. But investors seem just as enthusiastic about the future of Morgan Stanley. Its stock trades at the same multiple to shareholders equity as Goldman’s. Why? Morgan Stanley has arguably done more than Goldman to diversify away from trading to businesses, like wealth management, that are more stable. — Peter Eavis David M. Solomon is Goldman Sachs’s heir apparent. The Wall Street firm said Mr. Solomon would serve as its sole president and chief operating officer, setting him up as the potential successor to Lloyd C. Blankfein, the investment bank’s longtime chief executive. Context Mr. Solomon and Harvey M. Schwartz were seen as the favorites to eventually replace Mr. Blankfein when they were named co-chief operating officers and presidents in December 2016. But, Mr. Schwartz, who previously served as the bank’s chief financial officer and global co-head of the securities division, has decided to retire in April, Goldman said on Monday. “Harvey has been a mentor to many, and his influence has made an indelible impact on generations of professionals at Goldman Sachs,” Mr. Blankfein said in a news release. “I want to thank Harvey for all he’s done for the firm.” Mr. Solomon joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 and previously served as co-head of its investment banking division. — Chad Bray Critic’s corner Anthony Currie of Breakingviews writes: “If Solomon does take the reins, it would end some 12 years of traders holding top positions at the Wall Street firm – and serve as another sign of Goldman’s troubles in that business.” Case in point: • Trading accounted for 53 percent of Goldman’s revenue in 2012. • It made just over a third of the firm’s revenue last year. Advertisement “Meanwhile, takings from merger advisory and stock-and-bond underwriting – Solomon’s world – increased by half over the past six years. So positioning him as likely heir would look like a way of rewarding past success.” Goldman’s reputation for advising companies in mergers and acquisitions is well earned. Most years, it tops the rankings of advisers by deal volume known as the league tables. So it was a bit surprising to see Goldman currently ranked fifth on both the global and the United States league tables. Here’s a look: Global  Morgan Stanley: $228.88 billion JPMorgan: $198.82 billion Bank of America Merrill Lynch: $138.76 billion Lazard: $134.39 billion Goldman Sachs: $131.56 billion United States Morgan Stanley: $132.36 billion Lazard: $119.69 billion JPMorgan: $114.37 billion Centerview: $112.75 billion Goldman Sachs: $102.54 billion Two points to note: 1) It is still early in the year and one big deal can reshuffle the rankings; 2) The value of transactions Goldman has advised on this year is up 31 percent from the same period a year ago. Larry Kudlow emerged Monday as the latest favorite in a changing rotation of potential replacements for Gary D. Cohn as the head the National Economic Council. The job has not been formally offered to Mr. Kudlow, but the CNBC television commentator, who has informally advised President Trump on economic issues, is likely to interview him in the coming days. Context From the NYT’s Maggie Haberman and Jim Tankersley:  Heading into the weekend, the top contender to replace Mr. Cohn was Christopher Liddell, who is a special assistant to the president working with the Office of American Innovation on a team led by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser. Mr. Liddell’s previous experience as a chief financial officer for Microsoft had been seen as a selling point. But after The New York Times reported that Mr. Liddell was under consideration, Mr. Trump received pushback from people both inside and outside the White House, according to the people close to the president. On Monday, The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board wrote a piece critical of Mr. Liddell’s views on free trade. On Sunday, Mr. Trump again began discussing Mr. Kudlow as an option, the people close to the president said. In a revised prospectus filed this morning, the online storage company said that it planned to sell 36 million shares at $16 to $18 a share. At the midpoint of that range, Dropbox would be valued at about $7.5 billion, compared to the $10 billion of its most recent private fund-raising. Advertisement The big thought: The Dropbox offering — along with that of Spotify — could show how interested Wall Street investors are in the latest batch of Silicon Valley “unicorns,” or privately held companies worth at least $1 billion. The man who made Dropbox: Meet Drew Houston, who created a multibillion-dollar business because he forgot to bring a USB flash drive one day while a student at M.I.T. His holdings could be worth nearly $1.7 billion The market for initial public offerings is on a tear, and, going by Dropbox’s latest financial filing, it may be getting a little overheated. Dropbox, a company that stores files on remote computers for consumers and businesses, on Monday said it aims to price its shares at between $16 and $18. The midpoint of those two prices would value Dropbox at around $6.8 billion, excluding some shares that may be awarded to executives in the future. That’s a lot, though about 30 percent below the $10 billion valuation it received after its fundraising round in 2014. At $6.8 billion, Dropbox would be trading at just over six times the $1.1 billion in sales it had for 2017. Companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index trade at 2.3 times sales. Dropbox would also have a higher valuation than Box, another file storage company, whose market value is 5.6 times the revenue it generated in its last fiscal year, which ended in January. Investors may, however, decide that Dropbox’s higher valuation is not justified. True, its sales grew at an impressive 31 percent last year, but that is not materially faster than the 27 percent Box achieved in its latest fiscal year. (Revenue grew 6.3 percent at companies in the S.&P. 500, according to FactSet.) Advertisement Neither company made a profit in their most recent fiscal year. Both are generating positive cash flows, though. And at $330 million last year, Dropbox’s cash flows were more than five times those of Box’s $62 million. If Dropbox went public at the $6.8 billion implied in Monday’s filing, it would trade at 21 times its 2017 cash flows. That is pricey, but that is less than half of Box’s cash flow multiple. — Peter Eavis Speculation has long swirled that Apple should buy Netflix. On Monday, the iPhone maker agreed to buy Texture, the “Netflix of magazines.” Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . The digital magazine app offers users a $10 a month subscription to read more than 200 magazines, including People, the New Yorker, Vanity Fair, and Vogue. The deal is part of Apple’s effort to bolster its services businesses. The WSJ reports: Apple has set a goal of increasing total revenue from services to more than $40 billion by 2020. The company generated nearly $30 billion in services revenue in its fiscal year ended in September. The Texture transaction follows Apple’s deal for Shazam, the music recognition app, in December. Texture is owned by Next Issue Media, a joint-venture between Condé Nast, Hearst, Meredith, News Corp, Rogers Media and K.K.R. Apple did not disclose the price. Shares of the video streaming company are down 3.4 percent Monday to about $320 after the short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research tweeted that he thinks the stock can be ”shorted back to $300.”

From the outside, the Saudi businessmen (including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal) who were corralled into Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton — in what Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described as an anticorruption campaign — seemed to be in a gilded cage. The reality was far more disturbing. Many were physically abused and one captive was killed, witnesses told the NYT. The Saudi government extracted billions of dollars of assets from detainees to set them free. More from Ben Hubbard, David Kirkpatrick, Kate Kelly and Mark Mazzetti of the NYT: One former detainee, forced to wear a tracking device, has sunk into depression as his business collapses. “We signed away everything,” a relative of his said. “Even the house I am in, I am not sure if it is still mine.” The net effect: Many outside investors, whom Saudi officials have hoped to woo to help transform the kingdom’s economy, are now rattled by what they say was a lack of transparency. Advertisement Of note: The roles of the accounting company PWC and the law firm Clifford Chance in the Saudi government’s takeover of MBC, a broadcaster. Elsewhere in the kingdom: Aramco is more likely to go public next year than late this year as originally expected, Michael reported yesterday. Among the issues is that much of the work in pulling off the biggest I.P.O. in history has yet to be finished. Students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School took out a full-page ad in the NYT over the weekend to thank businesses “who acted on their consciences and took positive steps for change” after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. Among the companies thanked: BlackRock, Bumble, Delta, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Gucci, Kroger, REI and Walmart. The students are looking for GoFundMe donations for their March For Our Lives on March 24 in Washington. Lots of big businesses weren’t mentioned. Let us know if your company is changing its policies or donating to the march. History hasn’t been kind to those who seek victory in trade conflicts, though it remains unclear whether President Trump’s tariffs will play out the same way.

 OSLO —  Many Norwegian companies lag high standards for reporting their impact on the environment that the Nordic nation's $1 trillion wealth fund is championing abroad in 2018. The world's biggest sovereign wealth fund, which is barred by the Norwegian government from investing at home, wants the 9,100 companies in which it holds stakes to submit data on issues such as water use and climate effects to London-based non-profit group CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project. In Norway, just two firms - DNB bank and property firm Entra - were on a CDP list of 160 ""A"" rated performers worldwide for disclosure in 2017. That was comparable to other Nordic nations but not exemplary, CDP data show. Norway's state-controlled oil group Statoil got an ""F"" grade for disclosure of fresh water use - a core focus area for the fund abroad - after it declined to take part in the CDP survey. Advertisement On climate change reporting, including tracking greenhouse gas emissions, Statoil got a strong ""A-"". ""It's not our responsibility"" to ensure that Norwegian firms comply, central bank governor Oeystein Olsen told Reuters when asked if Oslo was pressing higher standards abroad than at home. The wealth fund is managed by a unit of the central bank. Advertisement CDP said there were no Norwegian firms, for instance, among almost 100 companies including L'Oreal, Walmart and Toyota rated as leaders in tracking greenhouse gas emissions in their supply chains. ""If Norwegian companies want to take a leadership role on climate change they should be engaging with their suppliers on these issues,"" said Sonya Bhonsle, head of supply chain at CDP. Norway's fund, built from the nation's oil and gas revenues, says global warming is stoking downpours, droughts and rising sea levels that threaten long-term earnings. It says investors need harmonized data to compare risks. Its policies, such as restricting investments in coal companies, have huge influence for companies and investors because it owns on average 1.4 percent of all listed shares worldwide. Yngve Slyngstad, the fund's CEO, said it encouraged companies abroad to ""strengthen their reporting in general, directly to the investors, but also indirectly through the CDP"". Few companies are doing enough on climate change, he said. SEA WATER Statoil spokesman Erik Haaland said the company did not take part in the CDP fresh water survey because most of the firm's operations are offshore, using abundant sea water. Statoil has water-intensive shale oil and gas in the United States. ""Also, the questionnaire is quite extensive, and since the issue is less material for our operations we made the decision to not take part,"" he said.  . Asked if the government had a double standard, Norway's deputy Finance Minister Geir Olsen wrote in an e-mail that the ministry ""welcomes efforts to standardize climate reporting according to internationally agreed principles."" Advertisement The finance ministry oversees the sovereign wealth fund. Martin Skancke, a consultant on the design of sovereign wealth funds, said ""obviously there is a reasonable expectation that when the government promotes these standards through the fund in foreign markets that it also promotes them internally"". He said that, from his own experience on boards of Norwegian companies, the center-right government does urge companies to disclose environmental data. He said it was hard to estimate the extra costs of such reporting. Among other Norwegian companies, state-controlled telecoms group Telenor got an ""A-"" for climate change reporting in 2017, while aluminum producer Hydro and fertilizer-maker Yara International, in which the state owns just over a third, got ""C""s. Hydro said it had reported to the CDP since 2004 but lost marks on technicalities. ""When filling in the CDP questionnaire, we are more occupied about reporting quality information requested by important stakeholders, than exactly following the CDP format,"" it said in an e-mail. Yara spokeswoman Kristin Nordal said the company halved its greenhouse gas emissions between 2004 and 2013. ""We will certainly not claim to have all the answers in place on issues such as climate and water, and we are presently going through a strategic process to further improve our response to sustainability matters,"" she said. Abroad, the companies in which the fund has the biggest holdings - Apple Inc and Nestle - both got ""A"" grades from CDP for climate change reporting. On fresh water use, most big foreign energy companies joined Statoil in declining to take part in the CDP water survey. Exceptions included Total and Neste Oy.

 Here’s what to expect in the week ahead: TRADE The seventh round of negotiations over the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement will kick off this week in Mexico City, as negotiators from Canada, Mexico and the United States once again meet to try to hammer out their differences over the trade pact. President Trump’s recent statements suggest that the threat of the United States imminently withdrawing from the agreement has receded in recent months. But the countries are still at odds over issues like rules on automobile manufacturing and investment. The countries will face a challenging task as they try to move toward consensus on these issues before the end of the negotiating round on March 5. Ana Swanson ECONOMY Jerome H. Powell, the new Federal Reserve chairman, who arrived in that role as a relative unknown, will make his public debut on Tuesday morning when he testifies before the House Financial Services Committee. On Thursday, he will reprise the performance before the Senate Banking Committee. Mr. Powell has said that he plans to continue the Fed’s gradual retreat from its economic stimulus campaign, slowly raising interest rates and slowly reducing the Fed’s bond portfolio. While the economy is gaining strength, Mr. Powell is likely to emphasize that so far, stronger growth is increasing the Fed’s confidence in its plans, rather than giving it a reason to move more quickly. Binyamin Appelbaum Some events sell themselves: On Tuesday afternoon at the Brookings Institution, Janet L. Yellen, the former Federal Reserve chairwoman, will be interviewed by Ben S. Bernanke, her predecessor at the Fed. It will be Ms. Yellen’s first public appearance since she completed her four-year term as Fed chairwoman this month. Both Ms. Yellen and Mr. Bernanke are now fellows at Brookings and so free to speak candidly about their experience leading the Fed through the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Brookings says they’ll address Ms. Yellen’s career, “her time at the Fed, her observations about the current state of the economy and the challenges that confront us.” Binyamin Appelbaum After passage of the Republican tax overhaul in December, big companies including Apple and Walmart said they would share their tax savings with employees in the form of raises and bonuses. Economists are skeptical of the cause and effect, noting that the low unemployment rate is also putting pressure on companies to raise pay. But whatever the reason, the bonuses are real — and could show up in data that the Commerce Department will release on Thursday. The report, which covers Americans’ income and spending in January, won’t capture the direct effects of the tax cuts, which mostly didn’t show up in workers’ paychecks until February. But it could show the impact of bonuses and pay increases, as well as any extra spending they might have generated. Don’t expect a big bump, however: Economists surveyed by Bloomberg said both income and spending probably grew more slowly in January. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, will be watching the report for any signs that inflation is picking up. Ben Casselman GOVERNMENT More than 3,000 officials from across China will gather in Beijing at the end of the week for the annual twin sessions of the country’s top advisory body and the country’s Legislature. The advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, includes many tycoons and other business leaders and will start meeting on Saturday. The Legislature, the National People’s Congress, will start meeting the next Monday and is expected to stay in session for nearly two weeks. The congress typically starts with the annual work report of the premier, Li Keqiang. That is followed by the rubber-stamp approval of a long list of government initiatives — a couple of constitutional amendments are expected this year to cement the primacy of President Xi Jinping. Perhaps most important is that the congress will confirm a new slate of government ministers after the twice-a-decade Communist Party national gathering in Beijing last October. Most of the new lineup is already known, but considerable uncertainty surrounds who might succeed Zhou Xiaochuan, who turns 70 this year and is expected to retire after serving as governor of the central bank since 2002.

 A media company is expanding its newsroom. You read that right. The Atlantic plans to add as many as 100 employees to its staff over the next 12 months, its president, Bob Cohn, told employees during a staff meeting on Wednesday. The hirings will represent a 30 percent increase in personnel at the publication, with half the jobs going to newsroom employees. “We have great ambitions to grow The Atlantic and make it better and these are the ways we think we can do it,” Mr. Cohn said in an interview on Tuesday. The ramping up comes six months after Emerson Collective, an organization run by the philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs, acquired a majority stake in The Atlantic. The Atlantic’s decision to go on a hiring spree is surprising at a time when legacy publications and recently established websites alike are cutting costs and shedding employees. The announcement of the hires came on a day when Vox Media said it would lay off some 50 staff members, with most of those targeted working in the social video departments at Racked, Curbed and SB Nation. The Vox Media move occurred, not coincidentally, after Facebook recalibrated its News Feed to drive less traffic to content produced by professional news organizations. Advertisement Earlier this month, CNN Digital announced job cuts, and Condé Nast laid off senior employees at Vanity Fair and Glamour magazines, both of which have newly installed editors. Last fall, taking cost-cutting measures, Condé Nast ended the regular print run of Teen Vogue and reduced the print frequency of other magazines in its stable, including Bon Appétit and W. Advertisement The austerity plan at Condé Nast coincided roughly with the sale of the once-mighty Time Inc. to the Meredith Corporation — the Des Moines-based publisher of Better Homes and Gardens and Family Circle magazines — in a $2.8 billion deal made possible by an equity infusion from Koch Industries, the conglomerate run by Charles G. and David H. Koch. With Emerson Collective as its new patron, The Atlantic has avoided the grim fates of its fellow news organizations. In a memo to the staff, Mr. Cohn said that circulation is at an all-time high — it rose 13 percent last year — and that visits to TheAtlantic.com rose by 25 percent in 2017. “I think quality journalism is a scarce commodity these days and I think the discerning readers reward places that are making stories that mean something,” Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, said. The planned additions to the newsroom are meant to bolster the magazine’s coverage of Washington, Hollywood, Europe and the tech industry. “It will be a mix of writers and editors and video producers and podcast producers and live events producers,” Mr. Cohn said. “Those are areas of coverage that we want to focus on, and we’ll do it across all our platforms: digital, print, live events, video, audio, newsletters.”  . Other jobs will go to engineers, designers and members of a new team the magazine has called Talent Lab, which is intended to “help us achieve one of our paramount goals: ensuring that our team is truly representative of America in all of its diversity,” Mr. Cohn wrote. When it acquired a majority stake in The Atlantic, Emerson Collective — which focuses on education, the environment and immigration — expanded its portfolio of media and entertainment holdings. It is also an investor in Axios, a media company started by the Politico co-founder Jim VandeHei and its former star reporter, Mike Allen, and in Pop-Up Magazine. In 2016, it took a minority stake in Anonymous Content, the production and talent management company behind the movie “Spotlight.” The organization also supports several nonprofit journalism organizations, including The Marshall Project, Mother Jones and ProPublica. It was founded in 2004 by Ms. Powell Jobs, the widow of the Apple co-founder Steven P. Jobs, who died in 2011. Advertisement “Emerson is eager to see us grow and succeed, and they were excited at helping to make this happen,” Mr. Cohn said. Mr. Goldberg said he looks forward to bringing The Atlantic back to its 19th-century roots, when its founders, including heavyweights like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Oliver Wendell Holmes, viewed the magazine as a forum for some good old intellectual brawls and tussles. “We are in a moment of national fracturing, and our expansion allows us to do a lot more of the kind of work that really is in our DNA,” Mr. Goldberg said. “We can double down on our coverage of Washington and this administration. We can double down on publishing the best and most interesting and thought-provoking ideas about the American future.” Follow Jaclyn Peiser on Twitter: @jackiepeiser.

 When Nicola Todd, 29, and Eva Mehesfalvi, 31, decided to visit Manhattan from England recently, they wanted a hotel that would be light on the pocketbook but big on the New York City experience. So instead of springing for a place with oversize rooms and round-the-clock room service, they chose the Moxy Times Square, which offered small but stylish rooms, quirky décor, lightning-fast Wi-Fi and eclectic lounge and bar areas, all at an affordable price. “I wanted something that felt very urban, very New York, something with a little bit of character,” Ms. Todd said. “I feel a lot of the Hiltons and Marriotts are very cookie-cutter. No matter where you are in the world, they all kind of feel the same.” The Moxy Times Square, however, is part of the Marriott empire. Marriott is just one of a growing number of companies that are rolling out product lines to attract the cash-conscious millennial. It now has 20 Moxy hotels around the world and plans to open 90 more by the end of 2021. Advertisement Millennials, broadly defined as those born in the last two decades of last century, have, as a group, tended to put more emphasis on experiences. And this has become a challenge for businesses. Advertisement “The Kardashians paint a false picture of millennials,” said Joan Kuhl, founder and president of Why Millennials Matter, a New York research agency. “I don’t see this group with a lavish affluent lifestyle.” Millennials, many of whom saw their parents struggle with jobs and mortgages during the recession, generally have less interest in buying the big house, flashy sports car and designer clothing that previous generations sought as status symbols of success. Nevertheless, they will pay for the right experiences and technology. “It’s where you go on vacation, what you do and what technology you have,” said Allen Adamson, one of the founders and managing partners of Metaforce, a brand marketing and consulting firm, and one of the authors of “Shift Ahead: How The Best Companies Stay Relevant in a Fast Changing World.” Those experiences need to be “Instagram-worthy,” too. The quirkier, flashier and more offbeat the experience, the better, he said. And businesses are catching on. IMAX, for instance, rolled out six virtual reality theaters in New York, Los Angeles, Shanghai, Manchester and Toronto over the last year as a pilot project to attract millennials. And it has plans to open four more. IMAX charges roughly $10 for a 10-minute VR experience, which is far cheaper than the $1,500 or more needed to buy an in-home VR technology system with a high-end PC and headset. A visitor steps into a pod, snaps on a VR headset and is virtually transported on a 360-degree journey that can include flying over volcanoes, diving into the world of criminals and hit men from the John Wick films, or stepping into the shoes of virtual game superheroes like Batman and Wonder Woman. Afterward, the players receive a video of their VR experience, which they can share with friends on social media. “Millennials want really special experiences and ones that are hard to replicate,” said Rich Gelfond, the chief executive of IMAX. When it comes to automobiles, many millennials don’t care about high-end cars the way that previous generations did, but they do want the in-cabin technology and luxury features that often go with them, said Sam Russell, Buick’s marketing director.  . So Buick started marketing the brand as “attainable luxury” to attract younger buyers, and it added features normally seen in cars like Mercedes-Benz, Lexus and BMW to many of its models in recent years, like 4G LTE Wi-Fi, Apple CarPlay and Ionizer air purifiers. Advertisement As for the Moxy, its very existence is aimed at millennials. “We’re delivering a killer experience at a price point that’s affordable,” said Toni Stoeckl, global brand leader of Marriott’s Distinctive Select Brands. To keep rates down, Moxy’s rooms are tiny, averaging only 183 square feet. But its lounges, bars and public spaces are large and encourage a social atmosphere, where guests can mingle and even play board games with friends and strangers. Guests check in electronically through their phones or through the hotel bar instead of at a front desk. There are special events, like midnight pajama parties, where guests are invited to the bar for a nightcap, as well as yoga classes, tarot card readings and “ConBody” events, where ex-convicts lead prison-style boot-camp fitness classes. At the Moxy Times Square, a neon-pink light marks the entryway and art graces the ceiling and walls. And its five rooftop dining and nightclub spaces, operated by the Tao Group, contain a rotating carousel bar and outdoor mini-golf course with a clear view of the Empire State Building. “It’s funky and quite quirky,” said Karl Fegredo, 27, from London, who recently stayed at the hotel. Even Moxy’s hotel openings are edgy and memorable. At the Moxy New Orleans party, snake charmers, tarot card readers and sword swallowers took part in its “Freak Show” theme. The Berlin Moxy “coming out” party featured drag queens, dominatrixes and tattoo artists as part of an S.&M. theme. “Moxy is about transforming yourself in a playful environment,” Mr. Stoeckl said. Many brands hope that by capturing millennials now, they can turn them into lifelong customers. “I think everybody understands they really need to home in on millennials,” Mr. Gelfond said, “if they want to create a successful long-term business.” A version of this article appears in print on February 26, 2018, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Wooing Millennials With Exotic Experiences That Aren’t Too Expensive.

18-Feb,"Advertisement By JOHN KOBLINFEB. 18, 2018
 If you run a broadcast network these days, it’s easy to feel left out. “All the excitement is about cable and streaming,” the chairman of NBC Entertainment, Robert Greenblatt, said in an interview. “We are the forgotten business on some level.” The talk in the entertainment industry has indeed drifted elsewhere lately, with the streaming giant Netflix luring the super producers Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy away from traditional television with nine-figure deals and Apple starting to shell out the $1 billion it earmarked for streaming content to the actress-producer Reese Witherspoon and other show creators. Earlier this month, Mr. Greenblatt lost a top NBC Entertainment executive, Jennifer Salke, to another free-spending upstart, Amazon Studios, which hired Ms. Salke as its new leader. But Mr. Greenblatt’s network is positioned relatively well among the networks. Last week, NBC pulled ahead of CBS in total viewers through the first 20 weeks of the 2017-18 season, the first time it has had the lead since 2002. Advertisement Mr. Greenblatt has another reason for optimism: He is holding onto a trove of in-house statistics he believes are the key to proving to advertisers that broadcasters can make the transition to the streaming universe. Advertisement Nielsen ratings, which measure the number of viewers who tune in for shows at the time of their broadcasts, are down for the networks yet again — 10 percent this season. NBC has responded by learning to make money from viewers who stream its programs — and now it is learning how to put a number on it. The key is gathering statistics from services like NBC.com, the NBC app, video on demand and Hulu to determine how much money its shows are pulling in from streamers. Take “This Is Us.” According to the network’s data crunchers, NBC has earned around 47 percent of the revenue generated by its 2016 pilot episode from advertising through digital views. Over all, 44 percent of the revenue NBC has earned from “This Is Us” has come through digital viewership. Similarly, the critically acclaimed sitcom, “The Good Place,” starring Kristen Bell and Ted Danson, has earned roughly 36 percent of its revenue from digital advertising, NBC said. The new source of revenue is NBC’s attempt to make up for a larger decline in advertising dollars. Television ad sales fell 8 percent in 2017, one of the biggest drops in years, Bloomberg reported. That’s why executives like Mr. Greenblatt need to make the digital business work sooner rather than later. “It’s not insignificant now,” he said, “and I think over time it grows into becoming really significant.” Not every show is making big money from digital views. About three-quarters of the revenue NBC made from the 2015 pilot of “Blindspot,” for instance, has been earned the old fashioned way. But NBC was less savvy back then in extracting money from viewers who preferred streaming. By the time of the first “This Is Us” season, NBC had wised up, striking a deal that allowed it to earn money from Hulu ads shown during episodes of the hit tear-jerker. Advertisement Generating revenue from streaming is relatively new for the networks, said Jeff Bader, NBC’s president of program planning, strategy and research.  . “When I came to NBC five years ago, we were in this place with: How are we going to manage this business that’s been in decline?” he said. “We were doing everything we could not to be the record industry and have our stuff pirated and not monetized.” Particularly depressing was the number of younger viewers who seemed to be changing their viewing habits. “For years, we were seeing our average age go up, up up,” Mr. Bader said. “Younger viewers were drifting. ” Once the network examined the data, however, it saw that younger viewers hadn’t abandoned NBC. They were just watching shows on their own schedules. NBC has intensified its efforts to measure the nontraditional audience with the Winter Olympics. Its latest ratings reports have combined the number of viewers it reaches through broadcast, cable and streaming platforms under a single figure it calls total audience delivery. This is the network’s attempt to counter the Nielsen measure, which shows a shrinking Olympics audience. NBC understands the reason for the advertising community’s skepticism concerning the number of people who watch shows via streaming, however. “That is the frustrating part of the whole ecosystem,” Mr. Greenblatt said, “because we don’t have a third-party objective measuring system that everyone has adopted that we all buy into.” Until that third-party system emerges, Mr. Greenblatt said that his sales department has gone all-in on selling advertisers on a statistical portrait that is prettier than the one painted by Nielsen. “This started for me purely on looking at viewership numbers, because I wanted to be able to make the argument, ‘People aren’t just bailing on network TV,’” he said. “Then it occurred to us, it’s not just a viewership number we’re defending. It’s part of the business model now and it’s going to be move that way more and more.” A version of this article appears in print on February 19, 2018, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: NBC Takes Shot at Counting Streaming Viewers.

15-Mar-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin MARCH 15, 2018
 Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Wells Fargo’s C.E.O. gets a pay raise. • Peter Thiel discusses trade. • Theranos’s fall is nearly complete. • Why John Skipper left ESPN abruptly. • Alibaba is exploring a China listing. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. There will be no roadshow. No ringing of the bell. No party or C.E.O interview from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Spotify, the streaming music service, is eschewing the traditional initial public offering for a direct listing and is taking its pitch directly to retail investors, streaming its presentation on its website Thursday. Advertisement Here are a few takeaways: Why a direct listing? The post-I.P.O. lockup period, during which employees can’t sell shares. “We have allowed shareholders and employees to buy and sell stock for years,” said Daniel Ek, Spotify’s C.E.O.and founder, said. “That shouldn’t stop just because our stock is more widely owned.” Advertisement The company is also well capitalized with positive free cash flow and no debt. Room to Grow? The number of smartphone users to continues to grow but Spotify said it only reaches a small portion within the countries it operates. The company is also working with auto makers to integrate its platform with cars, where more than 30 percent of music listening happens. Apple and Amazon are a big risk to Spotify’s business? Tech giants like Apple, Amazon and Google each have their own streaming music services. Spotify’s service is delivered over Apple’s iPhone and Amazon’s Echo. Those companies could prioritize their own services on their devices. What is the next date to watch? March 26. That’s the date when Spotify will release first-quarter results and 2018 guidance. What is “algotorial?” It’s the term that Spotify’s head of research and development used to describe the mix of algorithms and humans that Spotify uses to curate its music. Regulators recently penalized Wells Fargo for years of misconduct, but on Wednesday, the bank gave its C.E.O. a hearty pay rise. How did that happen? The numbers: Timothy J. Sloan’s compensation for 2017 totaled $17.6 million, a 35 percent increase from the $13 million he earned in 2016. His stock award for 2017 was $15 million, a big jump from $10.5 million in 2016. Is the increase justified, given the bank’s issues? Wells Fargo would no doubt point to the fact that Mr. Sloan decided to forgo a cash bonus in 2017. John G. Stumpf, a former C.E.O., got a $4 million cash bonus in 2015, for instance. Also, Mr. Sloan’s stock award was set in February last year and reflects his promotion in 2016 to C.E.O. And if Wells Fargo slips up badly over the next three years, Mr. Sloan may not get the entire $15 million stock award. Advertisement How does Mr. Sloan’s pay stack up against others? He is making less than the C.E.O. of Bank of America, Brian T. Moynihan, who made $21.8 million last year. But Mr. Sloan is making quite a bit more than the chief executives of large regional banks. US Bank’s chief executive, Andrew Cecere, had 2017 compensation of $12 million. But Mr. Sloan looks overpaid on a new metric that public companies must provide. This yardstick compares a C.E.O.’s pay with that of the median employee’s pay. Mr. Sloan’s 2017 pay was 291 times that of Wells Fargo’s median earner. That is above the 250 times for Mr. Moynihan. And Mr. Sloan’s ratio is far in excess of Mr. Cecere’s 205 times. — Peter Eavis One of President Trump’s most prominent supporters in the business world on Thursday said the United States would have the upper hand against China in a trade skirmish. Peter Thiel, a technology entrepreneur with libertarian leanings, told the Economic Club of New York that the United States doesn’t export enough to China to make it vulnerable to Chinese retaliation. If Mr. Trump imposed trade restrictions on Chinese goods, as he may in the coming weeks, China could do the same to United States exports. Mr. Thiel seemed unfazed by that. “It’s quite unclear where China can reciprocate because we are exporting so little,” he said. Mr. Thiel’s views echo those of Mr. Trump. 
            When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore-we win big. It’s easy!         The American exports to China are not small. They totaled $184 billion in the 12 months through the end of September 2017. That makes China the United States’ fourth-largest export market after the European Union, Canada and Mexico. The United States, however, imports far more from China than it exports, which means the deficit with China is far larger than it is with Mexico and the European Union. - Peter Eavis The blood-testing start-up was once one of Silicon Valley’s most lauded unicorns. But, the S.E.C. says, it deceived investors about what its tech could do and how much business it did. And its founder Elizabeth Holmes — a Stanford dropout who was compared favorably to Steve Jobs — has been stripped of her C.E.O. title and her shares. More from John Carreyrou of the WSJ, who first reported on issues at Theranos: Many Theranos investors have lost the entire value of their investment. The losses for [Rupert] Murdoch, once the company’s largest investor, total more than $100 million, people familiar with the matter said. The S.E.C. said in its civil lawsuit Wednesday that Theranos was “on the verge of bankruptcy” in late 2017. The company has been kept afloat by a loan from a private-equity firm that is secured by Theranos’s patents. Matt Levine of Bloomberg View reminds us about the company’s other victims: patients. Peter Henning’s take: The S.E.C.’s case shows that it considers privately held companies as capable of defrauding investors as publicly traded ones. Elsewhere in S.E.C. violations: The agency charged a former Equifax executive with insider trading, saying he sold shares after learning of the company’s data breach before it was publicly reported. It’s official: The CNBC commentator will become President Trump’s chief economic adviser, replacing Gary Cohn. But what will Mr. Kudlow — who on TV is an ardent supporter of free trade — push for? Advertisement He supports a strong dollar and tariffs that make exceptions for allies like Canada and Mexico. And he’s in favor of permanently extending the Republican tax cuts for individuals. As for his stance on China, here’s what he told CNBC: “A thought that I have is the United States could lead a coalition of large trading partners and allies against China, or to let China know that they’re breaking the rules left and right.” One thing to watch for: whether his past admission of substance abuse would affect his work. “We’ll see how that plays out,” Mr. Kudlow said. Critics’ corner: Mark Hamrick, Bankrate.com’s senior economic analyst, writes, “It remains to be seen whether Kudlow can step into the role of a virtual moderating influence in this administration.” And Noah Smith of Bloomberg View asserts, “It also seems like there are just so few credible economic thinkers willing to stand up and sign their name to the Trump economic agenda.” Elsewhere in economic policy: U.S. companies have few ways around the proposed metals tariffs. And U.S. allies might emphasize their toughness against China to win tariff exemptions. Mr. Kudlow has prognosticated on many economic and political issues, often in a way that mirrors his future boss. His predictions, which will soon carry new weight as the president’s top economic adviser, have not always been on the mark. Our colleagues Deborah Solomon and Kitty Bennett take a look at some of Mr. Kudlow’s not-so-on-the-money calls. Here are a few of the ones they found: In 2005 “All the bond bears have been dead wrong in predicting sky-high mortgage rates. So have all the bubbleheads who expect housing-price crashes in Las Vegas or Naples, Fla., to bring down the consumer, the rest of the economy and the entire stock market.” (Well, we all know what happened. By 2008, home prices were in a free-fall, threatening to plunge the financial system and the economy into the abyss.) In 1993 “There’s no question that President Clinton’s across-the-board tax increases on labor, capital and energy will throw a wet blanket over the recovery and depress the economy’s long-run potential to grow.” (The period between 1990 and 1999 was the longest bull market in history. The S&P 500 more than tripled during that time.) Advertisement In 2015 “Given the recent rise of presidential candidate Donald Trump, we should all be thankful that stocks haven’t plunged. Trump’s agenda of trade protectionism, dollar devaluation, and immigrant deportation is completely anti-growth. It’s like Fortress America in an economy that is completely globalized and where the U.S. must compete in the worldwide race for capital and labor. Trump’s policies don’t fit.” (President Trump was elected and the stock market has only climbed. ) • How Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone became a close adviser to President Trump on China — but lost the tariff battle. (WaPo) • After Rex Tillerson’s firing, Washington is wondering if H.R. McMaster, John Kelly or Jeff Sessions might go next. And allies are hoping that the cabinet reshuffle will clarify American foreign policy. • Moving from the C suite to Washington is tougher than it looks.

(WSJ) • Jeff Sessions is considering whether to fire the former F.B.I. deputy director Andrew G. McCabe days before he would retire, unnamed sources say. (NYT) An extortion plot related to his cocaine addiction. Mr. Skipper told The Hollywood Reporter: “In December, someone from whom I bought cocaine attempted to extort me.” “They threatened me, and I understood immediately that threat put me and my family at risk, and this exposure would put my professional life at risk as well. I foreclosed that possibility by disclosing the details to my family, and then when I discussed it with Bob, he and I agreed that I had placed the company in an untenable position and as a result, I should resign.” The WSJ reports that the Chinese online shopping giant is working on a plan to list shares in its home market. Such a listing would come nearly four years after Alibaba went public on the New York Stock Exchange, in what is the still the world’s largest initial public offering. Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . Details • A secondary listing could happen as soon as this summer, The WSJ reports. • China’s security regulators would have to change rules that bar foreign companies from listing in the country. Alibaba is incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Advertisement • China also doesn’t allow companies with dual-class share structure to list in the country. Context Alibaba’s plans come as “Chinese authorities are trying to lure some of the country’s technology stalwarts back to its capital markets,” The WSJ reports. Alibaba’s stock has jumped nearly 200 percent since it went public in 2014, gains that most Chinese investors have missed out on. Shares of Alibaba are up 3.1 percent Thursday. Christian Bittar, a former senior trader at Deutsche Bank, pleaded guilty earlier this month to conspiracy to defraud in the manipulation of a global benchmark interest rate known as Euribor, the Serious Fraud Office said on Thursday. A court in Britain lifted an order on Thursday that prevented the media from reporting his plea. “It would not be right to make comment prior to the trial of the remaining defendants and prior to Mr. Bittar’s sentencing,” David Savell, a lawyer for Mr. Bittar, said. Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $2.5 billion in penalties in 2015 related to the benchmark interest rate rigging scandal. A trial of five other traders is set for next month. - Chad Bray The Senate, in a rare show of bipartisanship, voted 67-31 to relax regulations on small to medium-sized banks. What the bill includes: • Raising the threshold for “systemically important” banks to $250 billion in assets, up from $50 billion • Exempting firms with less than $10 billion in assets from the Volcker rule But the House may want a more aggressive version that would curtail the power of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That could endanger the proposed overhaul, with the analyst Brian Gardner telling the NYT, “If the House overreaches in its effort to amend the Crapo bill, it could slow down the bill’s progress.” Elsewhere in banking: Why another Bear Stearns-like collapse isn’t likely, but another crisis is. The 70-year-old company’s plans to close or sell its stores in the U.S. and Britain show how hard life has become for bricks-and-mortar retailers. The collapse could put over 30,000 U.S. jobs at risk. Advertisement More on what happened from Michael Corkery of the NYT: Weighed down by the debt that its owners heaped on the company when they bought it, Toys “R” Us has not adequately invested in its fading stores and e-commerce operations. Unable to compete with other retailers, it has lost market share to better capitalized toy sellers. Speaking of Amazon: The company has become shorthand for “disruption” across industries. The current generation of Silicon Valley giants started out with an ethos of revolution first, fixes afterward. (Remember Facebook’s “move fast and break things” motto?) But Facebook, Google and others are becoming more bureaucratic, according to our columnist Kevin Roose — and that’s a good thing. Among the latest signs of change in their attitudes: • Facebook’s taking down accounts related to Britain First, a far-right group accused of inciting anti-Muslim hatred, and talking about the limits on its commitment to being an open platform. • YouTube plans to put info from Wikipedia alongside conspiracy videos (even if it didn’t tell the Wikimedia Foundation).

ECONOMIC SCENE
MARCH 6, 2018
 Should Facebook pay us for our puppy pictures? Of course, the idea sounds crazy. Posting puppies on Facebook is not a chore. We love it: Facebook’s 1.4 billion daily users spend the better part of an hour on it every day. It’s amazing that we don’t have to pay for it. And yet the idea is gaining momentum in Silicon Valley and beyond: Facebook and the other technological Goliaths offering free online services — from which they harvest data from and about their users — should pay for every nugget of information they reap. The spring break pictures on Instagram, the YouTube video explaining Minecraft tactics, the internet searches and the Amazon purchases, even your speed following Waze on the way to spend Thanksgiving with your in-laws — this data is valuable. It will become more valuable, potentially much more so, in the not-too-distant future. Getting companies to pay transparently for the information will not just provide a better deal for the users whose data is scooped up as they go about their online lives. It will also improve the quality of the data on which the information economy is being built. And it could undermine the data titans’ stranglehold on technology’s future, breathing fresh air into an economy losing its vitality. Advertisement The idea has been around for a bit. Jaron Lanier, the tech philosopher and virtual-reality pioneer who now works for Microsoft Research, proposed it in his 2013 book, “Who Owns the Future?,” as a needed corrective to an online economy mostly financed by advertisers’ covert manipulation of users’ consumer choices. It is being picked up in “Radical Markets,” a book due out shortly from Eric A. Posner of the University of Chicago Law School and E. Glen Weyl, principal researcher at Microsoft. And it is playing into European efforts to collect tax revenue from American internet giants. In a report obtained last month by Politico, the European Commission proposes to impose a tax on the revenue of digital companies based on their users’ location, on the grounds that “a significant part of the value of a business is created where the users are based and data is collected and processed.” Users’ data is a valuable commodity. Facebook offers advertisers precisely targeted audiences based on user profiles. YouTube, too, uses users’ preferences to tailor its feed. Still, this pales in comparison with how valuable data is about to become, as the footprint of artificial intelligence extends across the economy. Data is the crucial ingredient of the A.I. revolution. Training systems to perform even relatively straightforward tasks like voice translation, voice transcription or image recognition requires vast amounts of data — like tagged photos, to identify their content, or recordings with transcriptions. Advertisement “Among leading A.I. teams, many can likely replicate others’ software in, at most, one to two years,” notes the technologist Andrew Ng. “But it is exceedingly difficult to get access to someone else’s data. Thus data, rather than software, is the defensible barrier for many businesses.” We may think we get a fair deal, offering our data as the price of sharing puppy pictures. By other metrics, we are being victimized: In the largest technology companies, the share of income going to labor is only about 5 to 15 percent, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl write. That’s way below Walmart’s 80 percent. Consumer data amounts to work they get free. “If these A.I.-driven companies represent the future of broader parts of the economy,” they argue, “without something basic changing in their business model, we may be headed for a world where labor’s share falls dramatically from its current roughly 70 percent to something closer to 20 to 30 percent.”  . As Mr. Lanier, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl point out, it is ironic that humans are providing free data to train the artificial-intelligence systems to replace workers across the economy. Commentators from both left and right fret over how ordinary people will put food on the table once robots take all the jobs. Perhaps a universal basic income, funded by taxes, is the answer? How about paying people for the data they produced to train the robots? If A.I. accounted for 10 percent of the economy and the big-data companies paid two-thirds of their income for data — the same as labor’s share of income across the economy — the share of income going to “workers” would rise drastically. By Mr. Weyl and Mr. Posner’s reckoning, the median household of four would gain $20,000 a year. A critical consideration is that if people were paid for their data, its quality and value would increase. Facebook could directly ask users to tag the puppy pictures to train the machines. It could ask translators to upload their translations. Facebook and Google could demand quality information if the value of the transaction were more transparent. Unwilling to enter in a direct quid pro quo with their users, the data titans must make do with whatever their users submit. The transition would not be painless. We would need to figure out systems to put value on data. Your puppy pictures might turn out to be worthless, but that college translation from Serbo-Croatian could be valuable. Barred from free data, YouTube and Facebook might charge a user fee for their service — like Netflix. Alternatively, they might make their money from training A.I. systems and pay some royalty stream to the many people whose data helped train them. But whatever the cost, the transformation seems worthwhile. Notably, it could help resolve one of the most relevant questions coming into focus in this new technological age: Who will control the data? Today, the dominant data harvesters in the business are Google and Facebook, with Amazon, Apple and Microsoft some way behind. Their dominance cannot really be challenged: Could you think of a rival search engine? Could another social network replace the one all your friends are on? This dominance might matter less if companies had to pay for their users’ data. Advertisement Google and Facebook and Amazon would not be able to extend the network effects that cemented their place at the top of the technology ecosystem to the world of A.I. Everybody wants to be on Facebook because everybody’s friends are on Facebook. But this dominance could be eroded if rivals made direct offers of money for data. Companies with different business models might join the fray. “This is an opportunity for other companies to enter and say look, we will pay you for this data,” Mr. Posner said. “All this is so new that ordinary people haven’t figured out how manipulated they are by these companies.” The big question, of course, is how we get there from here. My guess is that it would be naïve to expect Google and Facebook to start paying for user data of their own accord, even if that improved the quality of the information. Could policymakers step in, somewhat the way the European Commission did, demanding that technology companies compute the value of consumer data? In any event, there is probably a better deal out there, in your future, than giving Facebook free puppy pictures.

 WASHINGTON/BEIJING —  U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports and will target the technology and telecommunications sectors, two people who had discussed the issue with the Trump administration said on Tuesday. A third source who had direct knowledge of the administration's thinking said the tariffs, associated with a ""Section 301"" intellectual property investigation, under the 1974 U.S. Trade Act begun in August last year, could come ""in the very near future."" While the tariffs would be chiefly targeted at information technology, consumer electronics and telecoms, they could be much broader and the list could eventually run to 100 products, this person said. The White House declined to comment on the size or timing of any move. In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Sino-U.S. trade relations should not be a zero-sum game, and that the two countries should use ""constructive"" means to manage tension. Advertisement ""We have said many times that China resolutely opposes any kind of unilateral protectionist trade measures,"" Lu told reporters. Advertisement ""If the United States takes actions that harm China's interests, China will have to take measures to firmly protect our legitimate rights."" Trump is targeting Chinese high technology companies to punish China for its investment policies that effectively force U.S. companies to give up their technology secrets in exchange for being allowed to operate in the country, as well as for other IP practices Washington considers unfair. The Trump administration is also considering imposing investment restrictions on Chinese companies over and above the heightened national security restrictions, but details on these were not immediately known. A U.S. Treasury spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But lobbyists in Washington expressed concern that Trump's ambitious tariff plan would also include other labor-intensive consumer goods sectors such as apparel, footwear and toys. Higher tariffs on these products would ""hurt American families,"" said Hun Quach, a trade lobbyist for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. ""We're not talking about fancy cashmere sweaters, we're talking about cotton T-Shirts and jeans and shoes that kids wear for back-to-school,"" she added. ""Alarm bells are ringing."" China runs a $375 billion trade surplus with the United States and when President Xi Jinping's top economic adviser visited Washington recently, the administration pressed him to come up with a way of reducing that number. Advertisement Trump came to office on a promise to shield American workers from imports and his first action as president was to pull the United States out of the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. His administration is in the midst of negotiations to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and last week announced the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. While the tariffs on steel and aluminum, announced last week by Trump, are viewed as relatively insignificant in terms of imports and exports, moves to target China directly risk a direct and harsh response from Beijing. ""If this is serious, the Chinese will retaliate. The key question is, does the U.S. retaliate against that retaliation,"" said Derek Scissors, a China trade expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a pro-business think tank.  . That would spook stock markets, but Scissors said that the more serious the conflict became, the worse China's position would become, due to the importance of its U.S. trade surplus. ""Their incentive to negotiate is to head us off from a major trade conflict."" NOT BIG ENOUGH The news website Politico earlier reported that the U.S. Trade Representative's office had presented Trump with a package of $30 billion in tariffs last week, but Trump told aides that this was not high enough. One Washington business source who had discussed the issue with the White House said the figure had now grown to about $60 billion, with a potentially wider array of products under consideration. A second person, who is an industry lobbyist in Washington  familiar with the administration's thinking, said the process was being led by Peter Navarro, an avowed protectionist, and by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who also favors tariffs as a tool to rebalance trade. Speaking to reporters in the Capitol, U.S. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady stressed that Trump was serious about addressing the issue of intellectual property theft with China. Advertisement ""He's serious about calling their hand on this, and my understanding is they are looking at a broad array of options to do that,"" Brady said. U.S. business groups, while uneasy about triggering Chinese  retaliation, have increasingly pressed Washington to take action on Beijing's industrial policies, such as market access restrictions and the ""Made in China 2025"" plan, which aims to supplant foreign technologies with domestic ones. Shortly after Trump took office, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a U.S. technology think tank whose board includes representatives from top companies such as Apple, Amazon, Cisco, Google, and Intel, called for coordinated international pressure on Beijing. While complaints about China's abuse of intellectual property rights are not confined to the United States, Trump's global steel and aluminum tariffs announced last week under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 complicate U.S. efforts to recruit allies to put pressure on China. A senior European diplomat in Beijing said China would be relieved to see Europe and Washington at odds over the metals tariffs. ""China's biggest worry has always been joint push-back from its major Western trading partners,"" the diplomat said. A China-based business source with knowledge of discussion among senior European officials said there had been a ""clear effort"" by the U.S. government over the past six months to introduce a coordinated approach to Chinese industrial policy, but that Trump's metals tariffs had undermined European support. ""Senior Trump administration officials had directly approached European leaders at a senior level. There had been a willingness to do something together on China. That's impossible right now. You can't cooperate when you're getting whacked around,"" the person told Reuters.

 NEW YORK —  Wall Street got exactly what it wanted from Friday's jobs report: solid hiring, moderate wage growth and continued low unemployment. Investors sent stocks sharply higher, particularly their recent favorites, technology companies. U.S. employers added 313,000 jobs in February, more than forecast, and wages didn't rise as much as investors had feared. The Labor Department also said January's spike in wages was a bit smaller than it originally thought. It made for a happy ninth anniversary for the current bull market. A month earlier, a jump in wages got investors worried about inflation and set off a stock market swoon, giving the benchmark S&P 500 index its first 10 percent decline in two years. ""I think the fears of wages getting out of control in this point in the cycle ... were squashed,"" said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management. Advertisement Bond yields also moved solidly higher as investors anticipated that the solid jobs survey portends more steady growth in the U.S. economy. Advertisement The Nasdaq composite regained the last of its February losses and closed at an all-time high. Banks also rose as interest rates increased, and industrial and health care and basic materials companies also climbed. Those sectors tend to do better when the economy is growing quickly. The S&P 500 index climbed 47.60 points, or 1.7 percent, to 2,786.57. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 440.53 points, or 1.8 percent, to 25,335.74. The Nasdaq composite jumped 132.86 points, or 1.8 percent, to 7,560.81. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks picked up 25.18 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,597.14. Apple rose $3.04, or 1.7 percent, to $179.98 and Microsoft jumped $2.11, or 2.2 percent, to $96.54. Both finished at record highs. Technology companies have led the market's rally since early 2017, and they have led the recovery from its recent lows as well. The S&P 500 is still 3 percent beneath its latest record high close, which came on Jan. 26. None of the other major S&P sectors have recovered all of their February losses, as technology has. Bond prices dropped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.90 percent from 2.85 percent. Banks advanced, but high-dividend stocks like utilities and phone companies fell. Those stocks are often compared to bonds and they tend to fall when yields move higher, as higher yields make them less appealing to investors seeking income. Stocks initially declined last week after President Donald Trump said he would place tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. They've recovered their losses after he granted exemptions to Canada, Mexico, and potentially to other countries. Nixon said the administration appears to be setting itself up to take a harder line in China. While China isn't a major exporter of steel to the U.S., trade disputes between the two countries aren't uncommon and the government is currently investigating China's treatment of intellectual property held by U.S. companies.  . ""Clearly the target here is China and how that unfolds will be important for markets,"" Nixon said. ""The collateral damage could be relatively wide unless it's done carefully, and so far the process has not been very careful."" Advertisement U.S. and South Korean officials said Trump might meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un by May to negotiate a potential end to Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program. The news helped send South Korea's Kospi up 1.1 percent. Other Asian indexes also rose. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 0.5 percent and. Hong Kong's Hang Seng also rose 1.1 percent. The White House later said the meeting won't happen unless North Korea takes ""concrete steps"" to match promises it has made. Netflix rose $14.44, or 4.6 percent, to $331.44 after the New York Times reported that the streaming service is negotiating with Barack Obama to have the former president and his wife Michelle produce shows. The two sides haven't confirmed that they are in talks. GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said a deal with the Obamas would be ""another major win for Netflix"" as it tries to launch more and more original shows. Toymakers fell following news reports that Toys R Us is getting ready to liquidate its U.S. operations. The chain, which filed for bankruptcy protection, has been unable to find a buyer or restructure its debt. Despite its struggles, it's still a major retailer of toys. Hasbro dropped $1.92, or 2.1 percent, to $91.46 while Mattel sank $1.13, or 7.1 percent, to $14.84. Energy companies climbed as benchmark U.S. crude added $1.92 or 3 percent, to $62.04 a barrel in New York, while Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose $1.88, or 3 percent, to $65.49 a barrel in London. Elsewhere, wholesale gasoline added 4 cents to $1.90 a gallon. Heating oil rose 3 cents to $1.89 a gallon. Natural gas lost 4 cents to $2.73 per 1,000 cubic feet. In Europe, France's CAC 40 rose 0.4 percent while Germany's DAX fell 0.1 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain rose 0.3 percent. Gold rose $2.30 to $1,324 an ounce. Silver added 11 cents to $16.61 an ounce. Copper jumped 6 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $3.14 a pound. The dollar rose to 106.77 yen from 106.24 yen.

ECONOMIC SCENE
MARCH 13, 2018
 Here’s a little known fact: One of the reasons the Ford F-Series pickup acquired its perch at the very top of the sales ranks of cars and trucks in the United States more than 36 years ago had a lot to do with chicken. The story: Hoping to fend off a surge of cheap American chicken into West Germany, in 1962 the European Common Market tripled the tariff on the birds to about 13.5 cents a pound. The United States struck back, of course. It imposed tariffs on brandy, a popular French export, and dextrin and potato starch to hit the Dutch. To take aim at West Germany, and please its friends in the United Automobile Workers union, it clobbered the commercial Volkswagen bus with a 25 percent levy on light trucks. Though the other retaliatory tariffs were lifted long ago, the chicken tax on light trucks — much higher than the typical 2.5 percent tariff on cars — remains in place. It is not a coincidence that light trucks account for 82 percent of the vehicles sold by the three big Detroit automakers. Advertisement The smell of a trade spat is back in the air. Since President Trump announced last week that he would impose tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum in the name of national security, pundits have been fretting about what other countries might do to the United States in return. Could this be the start of a free-for-all, tit-for-tat commercial conflagration that could put an abrupt halt to worldwide economic growth? Advertisement That is, of course, a possibility. But it is not the only risk. The new tariffs will inflict damage on the American economy even absent retaliation from abroad. If history is any guide, Mr. Trump is proposing to protect the homeland by shooting it in the foot. The closest parallel is the moment in 2002 when President George W. Bush decided that, for the umpteenth time, domestic steel makers deserved a hand and imposed tariffs of 8 to 30 percent on a variety of steel products from many countries. Imports from the affected countries plummeted, of course. But others — in steel categories not covered by the safeguard and from excluded countries protected by preferential deals — surged. Overall steel imports increased 3 percent over the next 12 months. Employment in the American steel industry kept declining. And according to one study, by the time the tariffs were lifted in 2003, higher steel prices had cost 200,000 jobs in steel-using companies, more than all the jobs in the steel industry itself. Undeterred, President Barack Obama did roughly the same thing. After complaints about surging imports, he put tariffs on Chinese tires. Presumably nobody told him that American tire makers no longer produced the kind of low-grade tires exported by the Chinese. In any event, imports from other countries jumped 20 percent after the tariff was imposed. And the price of all imported tires rose by 18 percent, on average. Gary Clyde Hufbauer and Sean Lowry at the Peterson Institute for International Economics calculated the additional cost to consumers at $1.1 billion — or about $900,000 per tire job saved. But the wages of workers whose jobs were saved amounted to about 5 percent of that. The lesson is not that protectionism is porous. It is. And it can be gamed. Until a few years ago, Ford attached rear seats and rear windows to the Transit Connect vans it imported from its plant in Turkey. Once they had gone through customs — paying the 2.5 percent tariff on passenger vehicles instead of the heftier 25 percent levied on commercial vans — the seats and windows were ripped out and recycled. The critical takeaway is that the distortions brought about by trade barriers impose a cost on the economy. It might not be easy to spot before the fact, but it tends to be more substantial than whatever fleeting gains protectionism can bring about to the protected. Advertisement Think of the multifiber agreement, which until its demise at the end of 2004 allowed the United States to impose individual quotas on thousands of pieces of apparel — cotton diapers from China, trousers from Guatemala. The rationale was to protect one of the lowest-wage industries in the country from lower wages in the developing world. A study by the United States International Trade Commission cited by the Dartmouth economist Douglas A. Irwin in his 2002 book, “Free Trade Under Fire,” concluded that it had raised apparel prices by 18 to 24 percent, imposing a particular burden on poor households.  . Sometimes the cost can squelch an industry. A 63 percent tariff on advanced flat-panel screens for laptop computers in 1991 helped drive a stake through the heart of the American laptop industry itself. Japan’s Toshiba stopped making laptops in the United States. Apple moved production to Ireland. An IBM spokesman called the decision “an eviction notice from the U.S. government to the fastest-growing part of the U.S. computer industry.” Similarly, the ring of protection around the sugar industry almost killed it instead. Hoping to protect a price floor for sugar of 16.75 cents a pound even as world prices sank, in the 1980s Washington resorted to increasingly stringent import quotas that drove domestic sugar prices up to five times the world average. Clever Canadian firms sent sugary cake mixes to the United States — where the sugar was extracted. Other countries grabbed on to the tactic. In 1985, Washington put emergency quotas on all imports of sweetened cocoa, cake mixes and edible preparations. South Korean noodles — with 0.002 percent sugar content — were snagged in the dragnet. So was kosher pizza from Israel. Then the unthinkable happened: Coke and Pepsi decided to replace expensive sugar with much cheaper high-fructose corn syrup. From 1980 to 1987, the share of sugar in American sweetener consumption, previously 65 percent, dropped to 47 percent. “In the longer term, this market reaction to the sugar program may indeed threaten the economic viability of the entire sugar industry in the United States,” the economist Anne O. Krueger noted in an analysis of the sugar supports. Sugar quotas are still around, nonetheless. Candy makers including Hershey and Ferrara have moved factories offshore. In 2006, the International Trade Administration concluded that for each sugar growing and harvesting job saved between 1997 and 2002, three confectionary manufacturing jobs were lost. Sugar quotas even undermined American policy to counter narcotics trafficking. The Central Intelligence Agency concluded that falling sugar exports encouraged farmers in Jamaica and Belize to switch to marijuana. Mr. Trump might look back fondly at that long-ago chicken tax. In the 1980s, Detroit did everything it could to fend off Japanese automakers. It persuaded the Reagan administration to force the Japanese into “voluntary” export restraints on cars — raising car prices for American consumers. Advertisement Nothing was as successful as the chicken wall. It eroded over time. S.U.V.s were ultimately allowed into the United States as cars. Japanese automakers started making monster pickups and S.U.V.s in the United States, too. Still, fewer than a quarter of cars sold in the United States are made in America. The share for light trucks is 54 percent. But there was a cost: more expensive pickup trucks, for starters, not to mention the discarded seats and windows from Ford’s Transit Connects. The tariff also successfully kept smaller, low-margin trucks from competing with the less-efficient models made at home. Alongside low gasoline prices and easy fuel-economy standards, Detroit’s love affair with trucks arguably gave the United States the least fuel-efficient fleet in the industrial world. If gasoline prices were to rise — say, in an effort to combat climate change — a gas-guzzling domestic auto industry could prove a weak link in the nation’s security.

 LONDON — Comcast may have found a way to disrupt Walt Disney Company’s plan to buy most of 21st Century Fox: topping Fox’s bid to buy the British satellite broadcaster Sky with its own $31 billion takeover offer. The bid, plans for which were announced on Tuesday, seizes upon 21st Century Fox’s difficulties buying the piece of Sky that it does not already own. British regulators have expressed repeated concerns about giving Rupert Murdoch and his family more control over the country’s media, stretching the approval process out over more than a year and forcing 21st Century Fox to offer more concessions. Comcast has said that buying Sky would help it expand in Europe, where the broadcaster has 23 million customers and owns rights to show the English Premier League and other professional soccer leagues. Disney, too, has been keen on expanding internationally, with the British company serving as an important part of its $52 billion plan to buy a significant portion of 21st Century Fox. Whoever prevails, it will shake up Disney’s plans. Either 21st Century Fox will have to pay more for Sky, or Disney will lose a valuable international property to Comcast. Advertisement In a statement, 21st Century Fox said that it “remains committed to its recommended cash offer for Sky,” which it made in 2016. Advertisement Disney, Comcast and others are rushing to strike major deals in a swiftly changing media landscape. AT&T has bid more than $85 billion to take over Time Warner, a proposed merger that the Justice Department is attempting to block. Consumers increasingly stream their movies and televisions shows over the internet. Upstart technology companies like Apple and Amazon nurture ambitions to rival Hollywood’s big studios. Online broadcasters are even increasingly bidding for the rights to show sports — long a major moneymaking business for traditional broadcasters and cable operators. The saga over Sky has been one of the most drawn out deal-making dramas in media. Mr. Murdoch, the 21st Century Fox executive chairman, has tried for years to take full control of the broadcaster, which he started in 1989. By owning the rest of Sky, 21st Century Fox would be better positioned to take on the likes of Netflix, Amazon and other streaming giants. In 2011, Mr. Murdoch was forced to withdraw a $12 billion offer for the rest of Sky as a firestorm erupted over phone hacking by the news media in Britain. The scandal eventually led to the closing of The News of the World, the first newspaper Mr. Murdoch acquired in Britain in the late 1960s. In December 2016, 21st Century Fox tried again, in an effort to expand its global reach and cement Mr. Murdoch’s legacy. The company agreed to buy the 61 percent of Sky that it does not own for about $16 billion. While the Office of Communications, or Ofcom, ruled in June that Mr. Murdoch and other company executives were “fit and proper” to hold broadcasting licenses in Britain, it also said that the deal warranted more scrutiny. In the regulator’s view, the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News had amounted to “significant corporate failures.” Then last month, Britain’s competition regulator provisionally rejected the deal, saying that it was “not in the public interest.” The regulator said it was concerned that the deal would give the Murdoch family “too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda.” It noted at the time that Murdoch-controlled outlets, which include the newspapers The Sun and The Times of London, were already consumed by nearly a third of Britain’s population. In hopes of winning over regulators, 21st Century Fox has offered to establish a “fully independent” editorial board for Sky News and to continue to fund the Sky News brand after the transaction for at least 10 years. Advertisement 21st Century Fox had hoped to complete the Sky deal before the Disney sale was finalized. But Comcast’s move just adds uncertainty to an already complicated process. Disney, which declined to comment on Comcast’s proposal, must now decide how much it cares about Sky. It is also not clear if Disney would want to end up being partners with Comcast, in the event that Comcast wins majority control of Sky and Disney ultimately has Fox’s 39 percent stake. While announcing the planned purchase of Fox’s entertainment assets in December, Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, singled out Sky as “a real crown jewel” in a television interview with Bloomberg. “We certainly would be looking forward to the opportunity to have Sky be part of our company,” he said.  . Comcast has circled 21st Century Fox in the past. Last year, the cable giant was in preliminary talks to buy the entertainment assets owned by 21st Century Fox, including the minority stake in Sky. Disney ultimately prevailed. At the very least, Comcast has most likely made it more expensive for 21st Century Fox to buy all of Sky. Under the terms of its proposed bid, Comcast said, it would pay 12.50 pounds, about $17.50, a share in cash. That would represent a premium of 13 percent over its closing price on Monday and is about 16 percent above 21st Century Fox’s current offer of £10.75. On Tuesday, shares of the British broadcaster jumped by nearly one-fifth. The stock surge suggested investors expected 21st Century Fox to back away or come back with an even better offer. Comcast shareholders seemed less pleased. The company’s stock price dropped more than 6 percent in midday trading, to about $37. Disney shares fell 4 percent, to about $105.50, and Fox shares declined 2.6 percent, to about $37.80. An influential media analyst, Craig Moffett, who follows Comcast for MoffettNathanson, wrote in a research note that the Sky offer had positive aspects, including offering Comcast’s entertainment unit, NBCUniversal, broader distribution in Europe. Still, “Comcast will have to twist themselves into knots to explain why satellite distribution won’t be just as obsolete in Europe as it already is in the U.S.,” Mr. Moffett said. “Perhaps worst of all, this morning’s bid doesn’t really put to rest the idea that they might still try a topping bid for Fox’s U.S. assets, including the rest of Sky” if the Justice Department ends up approving AT&T’s takeover of Time Warner. Advertisement “The notion that Comcast might make a topping bid for Fox has weighed heavily on Comcast shares,” he added. For either Comcast or Disney, Sky offers a platform for international expansion. Comcast said in a statement that about a quarter of its revenue would come from international operations should it seal a deal with Sky, up from 9 percent currently. In addition to its other businesses, Sky has also announced plans to start streaming services in Spain and Switzerland. “We look at Sky as a media company: Sky News, Sky Sports, Sky Movies,” Brian L. Roberts, Comcast’s chairman and chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts. “There’s tremendous presence in the content creation, not just the distribution.” In a research note on Tuesday, Polo Tang, a UBS analyst, said that Sky could be “strategically interesting” to a variety of bidders, given its content and its broadcast and streaming distribution network. It also recently retained the rights to the Premier League at a lower cost than analysts had expected. Mr. Tang said that the benign outcome of the Premier League auction potentially “gives Fox scope to raise its offers.” Comcast said it was seeking control of more than half of Sky’s shares with Tuesday’s offer but was ultimately interested in acquiring all of the British broadcaster. In a statement, Sky urged shareholders to take no action yet. The broadcaster added that its independent directors “are mindful of their fiduciary duties and their obligations under the U.K. Takeover Code.” Follow Chad Bray on Twitter: @Chadbray Brooks Barnes contributed reporting from Los Angeles.

26-Feb,"Advertisement Supported by By Matt Phillips President Trump promised that his tax cut would encourage companies to invest in factories, workers and wages, setting off a spending spree that would reinvigorate the American economy. Companies have announced plans for some of those investments. But so far, companies are using much of the money for something with a more narrow benefit: buying their own shares. Those so-called buybacks are good for shareholders, including the senior executives who tend to be big owners of their companies’ stock. A company purchasing its own shares is a time-tested way to bolster its stock price. But the purchases can come at the expense of investments in things like hiring, research and development and building new plants — the sort of investments that directly help the overall economy. The buybacks are also most likely to worsen economic inequality because the benefits of stocks purchases flow disproportionately to the richest Americans. The tax overhaul is the cornerstone of Mr. Trump’s economic plan. It has been a big win for companies, offering lower corporate rates and a permanent break on overseas profits. Warren E. Buffett said in his annual letter to investors on Saturday that his company, Berkshire Hathaway, enjoyed a $29 billion gain thanks to the new tax law. What companies do with the trillions of dollars they’re bringing back to the United States, and the money they will save each year on their tax bills, will in large part determine whether the plan is a success or a failure. As the tax cuts kick in, companies have laid out a variety of uses for the money. Some are paying out one-time bonuses to employees. Others are raising salaries. Others plan to open new factories. In the fourth quarter, American companies’ investments in things like factories and business equipment grew by 6.8 percent. That was the fastest growth rate since 2014, but far from the giant surge in capital spending that was promised ahead of the tax overhaul. But the buying back of shares is also at record levels. Almost 100 American corporations have trumpeted such plans in the past month. American companies have announced more than $178 billion in planned buybacks — the largest amount unveiled in a single quarter, according to Birinyi Associates, a market research firm. Such purchases reduce a company’s total number of outstanding shares, giving each remaining share a slightly bigger piece of the profit pie. Cisco said this month that in response to the tax package, it would bring back to the United States $67 billion of overseas cash, using $25 billion to finance additional share repurchases. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, authorized up to $8.6 billion in stock purchases. PepsiCo announced a fresh $15 billion in planned buybacks. Chip gear maker Applied Materials disclosed plans for a $6 billion program to buy shares. Late last month, home improvement retailer Lowe’s unveiled plans for $5 billion in purchases. On Monday, Mr. Buffett said on CNBC that Berkshire might be open to buy some of its shares. The remarks helped send Berkshire’s stock — and the broader market — higher. More buybacks are almost certainly on the way. UBS analysts covering Apple said the iPhone maker might authorize another $30 billion in share purchases when it reports its next quarterly earnings in April. That would be on top of the $30 billion it already spends each year to buy back its shares. “I’m expecting buybacks to get to a record for 2018,” said Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst with S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. “And if I’m disappointed, there’s a lot of people with me.” The flurry of planned buybacks has been good for the stock market. Early this month, stocks were down more than 10 percent from their January peak. The prospect of companies flooding markets with “buy” orders helped the market recoup some of its losses. The broader impact on the economy is less clear. Economists believe a rising stock market benefits the economy, helping support consumer and business confidence. But the vast majority of the billions of dollars in planned share purchases will benefit the richest 10 percent of American households, who own 84 percent of all stocks. The top 1 percent of households own about 40 percent of all stocks. Ultimately, the effect of the rising stock market depends on how those wealthy investors use their windfall. It helps the economy more, for example, if they put the money toward productive new companies than if they invest in government bonds. Companies typically decide to make long-term investments in things like new workers and factories based on whether they will make the company more profitable — not merely because the companies are sitting on a pile of money that they otherwise would have paid in taxes. At a news conference Thursday, the head of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, acknowledged that many companies were spending their money on buying their own shares. “Right now we’re going to have an adjustment where you see probably more dividends and share buybacks than wage increases,” Mr. Hassett said. “But going forward we’re going to see a lot of capital formation and wage growth.” That is not what happened in 2005, when a one-time tax holiday allowed companies to repatriate money on the cheap. That plan, championed by President George W. Bush, was sold as a way to get American companies to invest more in the domestic economy. Some $300 billion came back to the United States that year. But economists estimated that as much as 92 percent of it may have been paid out to companies’ shareholders — mostly in the form of buybacks. Studies have shown that the tax change lifted companies’ stock prices but did not expand their American work forces. Until the early 1980s, the practice of buying shares with corporate money was considered borderline illegal because it was thought to potentially open the company up to charges of manipulating share prices. But in 1982 the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule that gave the green light to most share repurchases, as long as they followed certain rules. Historically, American companies had paid out profits with a quarterly check, known as a dividend. But after the S.E.C.’s rule change, companies started using more of their profits to buy their own shares, in the process giving their shareholders a bigger piece of the company. Buybacks soon soared. By 2016, the most recent year for which there is complete data, companies spent $536 billion on purchasing their own shares, according to data from S. & P. Dow Jones Indices. That was about 5 percent less than those companies spent on new plants, research and development and other investments. By contrast, 20 years ago, companies spent four times as much on such investments as they did on buybacks. Some economists think the surge in share buybacks has something to do with the relative decline in capital investments, which recently have been lower  than expected. “We have some causal evidence that because of short-termism companies are doing some stock repurchases that maybe they shouldn’t do,” said Heitor Almeida, a professor of corporate finance at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “And maybe that’s causing them to reduce investment.” OpinionThe Editorial Board    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS One subscription.Endless discovery.

17-Feb-18,"Mr. Bailey is leaving the company he led as both chief designer and C.E.O. A new management team now has to revive the brand’s critical and financial fortunes. By ELIZABETH PATONFEB. 17, 2018
 LONDON — In a mahogany-paneled corner of the palatial Burberry flagship store on Regent Street, Christopher Bailey, the outgoing president and chief creative officer of Britain’s largest luxury brand, sat smiling at a corner table, shrouded in shadows. It was early February, 10 days before the unveiling of Mr. Bailey’s final collection for Burberry at London Fashion Week, and three months after he had announced his departure from the company, a once-dormant heritage brand that over 17 years he had transformed not only into a retailing phenomenon — a multibillion-dollar enterprise with 460 stores and 10,000 employees — but also a global symbol of Britishness. With that startling announcement, Mr. Bailey, 46, the former wunderkind of British fashion and one who had a cultlike following in the fashion world, had thrown up a plot twist no one anticipated. It’s one that may have repercussions throughout the industry as peers lobby for his job, the media speculates feverishly on what he will do next, and whether Burberry — and to a certain extent, British fashion — can maintain its place in a post-“Brexit” world. “I keep waiting for a surreal moment or existentialist crisis,” said Mr. Bailey, dressed in jeans and a denim shirt, stirring cappuccino in a china cup with his silver spoon. “Perhaps I haven’t really engaged with the finality of it all because I am still in pragmatic mode preshow. But I really do want this. I need some balancing in my life, having worked at a thousand miles an hour for so many years.” Advertisement He paused for a moment and smiled softly, even a little sadly. “Besides,” he added, “I did have time to percolate on what it would mean to leave Burberry, long before this all went into motion.” Certainly, the final years of Mr. Bailey’s tenure at the top were tumultuous, casting a shadow over a long and starry ascent that had begun when the affable Yorkshireman, son of a carpenter and a window-dresser for the British department store Marks & Spencer, graduated from the Royal College of Art in 1994. After a stint in New York working for Donna Karan, he moved to Milan to work for Tom Ford at Gucci, the job he had when, in 2001, he met Rose Marie Bravo, then the American chief executive of Burberry. Ms. Bravo was tasked with rebooting the company after decades of poorly conceived licensing deals diluted both the creative and commercial powers of the brand founded in 1856 and best known for supplying trench coats to British army officers during World War I. Advertisement “The moment I met Christopher, I knew he was the right person for Burberry — it almost felt like a divine intervention,” Ms. Bravo said of Mr. Bailey, then a relative unknown. Within weeks of that initial meeting, she hired him to replace the designer Roberto Menichetti as Burberry’s creative director. “Burberry had a very strong history and Christopher was so passionate about it, and that of Britain too. So I said to him: ‘How far can you push the boundaries of what Burberry stands for? What does this brand have the power to be and say about British fashion?’” Ms. Bravo said. Mr. Bailey’s answer was threefold. First, he imbued every collection with references and nostalgic flourishes drawn from British culture, class, experience and weather: the signature Burberry trench reinvented in every conceivable cut and color, in prints and lace and velvet; Wellington boots and Fair Isle knits; Bloomsbury-style floral prints and ’60s-style leather with rock ‘n’ roll flair. Then he enlisted a constellation of British stars for his ad campaigns and front rows: among them Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Cara Delevingne and Sienna Miller and up-and-coming male singers like James Bay and Tom Odell. And finally, he fully embraced technology long before most rivals did to reach new luxury audiences, becoming the first British brand to live-stream and live-tweet its shows, create YouTube video ads, and even create a Burberry channel on Apple Music featuring only British musical talent, which he did in 2015. As Burberry’s creative chief, working first alongside its chief executive officers Ms. Bravo and then Angela Ahrendts, Mr. Bailey came to enjoy a run as the golden boy of British fashion. “For more than a decade there was a common phrase in the industry: ‘doing a Burberry,’” said Alexandra Shulman, the former editor of British Vogue. “The idea of taking a languishing and not especially desirable brand, then turning it into a global success, became the ultimate 21st-century fashion fairy tale. Much of that was down to Christopher.” Advertisement Though Mr. Bailey initially moved the Burberry shows to Milan to demonstrate to the fashion world that it could — and should — compete with such global names as Gucci and Versace, in 2009 he brought them home. That was the same year the brand’s many offices were consolidated into a single London headquarters, Horseferry House, the better to convey a made-in-Britain message. (The building, a glossy minimalist temple kept immaculately tidy by its staff, was designed down to the last detail by Mr. Bailey himself — including the mineral-water bottles he created for the staff cafeteria.) “Christopher gave an unquantifiable boost to the identity of British fashion, making London Fashion Week a must-stop for buyers and press after years of being overlooked,” said Anna Wintour, editor in chief of American Vogue. “His genius was also in creating a world around Burberry where you could be any age or stage and still want a piece of it.” In 2013, Ms. Ahrendts took a job at Apple as head of retail, and less than a year later Mr. Bailey — already in charge of an enormous portfolio that ranged from overseeing 50 collections per year to store design and marketing — was given his greatest challenge to date: becoming her replacement, and the new chief executive. Some said later that Mr. Bailey was privately reluctant to take the leap, only to be vigorously encouraged by the Burberry chairman, Sir John Peace, fearful that his star designer might be getting restless. Others have suggested that as a figure whose down-to-earth modesty and witty intellect could occasionally unfurl to reveal the hallmarks of a control freak, the prospect of becoming the first designer from a major public brand to ever adopt a dual role — with such power — had proved irresistible to Mr. Bailey. Either way, his arrival in the boardroom as joint chief executive officer and chief creative officer coincided with an industrywide slump in global luxury sales, prompted by a crackdown on gift-giving and slowdown in economic growth in China, geopolitical instability and volatile foreign exchange rates. Given its mid-tier price points, multiple diffusion lines and varied retail channels, Burberry was left exposed: sales soon flagged across key markets, particularly in China. Both profits and share price trended down, prompting Mr. Bailey to execute a number of difficult cost-cutting maneuvers, including shuttering stores, streamlining diffusion lines, approving layoffs and shelving plans for a new factory in Yorkshire after the “Brexit” vote. Despite such buzzy initiatives as moving production to a “see now, buy now” approach, allowing customers to buy product straight from the runway, and combining his men and women’s shows into a single presentation, scrutiny among Burberry investors and the media over Mr. Bailey’s lack of formal business education — and hefty pay package — intensified over time. Acclaim for his collections, meanwhile, became more muted, from critics and shoppers alike. (In 2015, Mr. Bailey waived his bonus, taking a 75 percent pay cut — to 1.9 million pounds, or $2.6 million, from £7.5 million, or roughly $10.5 million.) “Trying to be both a C.E.O. and creative director backfired for Christopher Bailey,” said Luca Solca, head of luxury goods at Exane BNP Paribas. “Quite simply, he took on too much.” Josie Cox, the business editor at The Independent, a London newspaper, was equally blunt in a recent article about Mr. Bailey’s departure: “He became C.E.O. and couldn’t quite hack it.”  . After three rocky years during which Mr. Bailey juggled both his creative and management responsibilities, Marco Gobbetti of Céline was tapped to become Burberry’s new chief executive, with Mr. Bailey relinquishing the role to take up a newly created position as Burberry president last July. For a time the two men presented a united front, full of admiration for what the other would do for the now-flatlining fashion house. Then, on the last day of October, news broke that Mr. Bailey had something of a change of heart. His last collection for Burberry would take place during London Fashion Week, on Feb. 17. “I played no part in it and am sad to see him go,” Mr. Gobbetti said at the time of Mr. Bailey’s decision. He called him “extraordinary” and added that he had been instrumental in Burberry’s transformation. “I have thoroughly enjoyed working with him over the past year. The legacy Christopher leaves and the exceptional talent we have at Burberry give me enormous confidence in our future,” Mr. Gobbetti said. Advertisement Yet Mr. Bailey’s departure comes at a crucial, perhaps dangerous, time for Burberry. Mr. Gobbetti has unveiled a dramatic “elevation strategy” intended to reposition the company as a super-luxe brand like Louis Vuitton or Dior (which have traditionally had higher prices and profit margins). There will be new product lines, heavy investment in revamping boutiques, and no more Burberry in department stores that lean down-market, all of which will hit the brand’s financial performance, and share price, in the short term. But who will design such exciting new products? No one knows. A Burberry spokesman said this week that while a search was underway, there would be no comment on any individuals until the successful candidate had been identified. Speculation on who would get the job has included British names like Phoebe Philo (who left Céline in December), John Galliano (currently at Maison Margiela) and Stuart Vevers (at the design helm of Coach), and, most recently, Kim Jones, the former Louis Vuitton men’s wear designer applauded for revitalizing the Vuitton men’s wear line for a younger generation, mixing the house’s travel heritage with a more street-friendly style. Mr. Jones (perhaps pointedly) capped his final Vuitton show by sending out Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss — both famous Burberry girls — clad in trench coats. The 38-year-old has yet to confirm where he will go next. Mr. Bailey, for his part, seemed resolved, even relieved, about moving on. “Working at Burberry has been one of the great privileges of my life, and I hope that the next person we bring in feels as inspired and ambitious about this brand as I have,” was all Mr. Bailey would say on the matter last week. “Burberry has been like my family; it runs through my veins.” “But I just had to make a decision,” he continued. “Burberry was clearly at the start of a new chapter. Would I, could I, commit to another five or 10 years there, and keep doing what I know in a world that is so familiar? Or do I explore another way of life, and at the same time spend some more time with my husband, Simon, and my two beautiful little girls?” (Mr. Bailey married the British actor Simon Woods in 2012. The two have two daughters, Iris, 3½, and Nell, 2.) He chose the latter. In the short term, that means the completion of his last collection — a meditation on the passage of time, complete with archival pieces and new prints, including a reworking of the signature Burberry check with the rainbow hues of the L.G.B.T. flag — and finishing the obligations in his contract with Burberry, which runs out at the end of the year. For the long term, he doesn’t know what comes next. Friends have been quick to point out that he is a man of prodigious talent, zero financial limitations and great industry good will. Could he follow in the footsteps of someone like Tom Ford, who stepped away from fashion for a while to direct films? “With his interests spanning so much, from arts to fashion to music and technology, Christopher could honestly go on and do anything,” Ms. Wintour said. Advertisement “Whatever he touches will turn to gold,” Ms. Campbell added. “It isn’t just because he is a visionary. It is because unlike many people in this business, he is so decent. He treats everyone from a C.E.O. or celebrity to an intern with a basic level of kindness and respect. He only deserves the best.” Mr. Bailey said he was firmly in “listening mode.” He was looking, he added, at opportunities inside and outside the fashion world, but also relishing the prospect of spending time at his home in Gloucestershire. “I really don’t have any fixed plans yet,” Mr. Bailey said with a wide grin. “It might be something big and public. It could be something small and entrepreneurial. But whatever it is, I am definitely after another adventure.” A version of this article appears in print on February 18, 2018, on Page BU1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Final Runway Walk at Burberry.

11-Mar-18,"Advertisement By SYDNEY EMBERMARCH 11, 2018
 DES MOINES — Steve Lacy greeted me in his office as if we were old friends. A top executive at the Meredith Corporation, he was a main driver of the company’s $2.8 billion acquisition of Time Inc. last November. With that deal, the 116-year-old Meredith Corporation became the largest magazine publisher in America. When he spoke, it was clear Mr. Lacy took pride in Meredith’s unassuming corporate culture, so far removed from the New York magazine scene. “In Des Moines, Iowa, we don’t have to prove anything to anybody about the Meredith Corporation,” Mr. Lacy said. “We don’t have drivers. We’d look silly, and it would be not in keeping with who we are.” He added, “I presume you know that if I want a black car, I can get one.” Mr. Lacy, 63, is a trim man, born and raised in Kansas, with neat white hair. He steered me to a table by a large framed photograph of a bald eagle. Not far from his office on the 14-acre Meredith campus, a 24-foot sculpture of a trowel sticks out of the earth at an angle, as if tossed by a gardening giant. Advertisement He managed to keep the company thriving when his competitors were shutting down magazines. And now that the New York approach to the magazine business may have run its course, it seems that Meredith has tortoised the hare. “You have to realize that the vast majority of all media companies’ consumers have a life beyond the Hudson River,” Mr. Lacy said. “The consumer we sell our product to has a very different life than what goes on on Manhattan Island.” Advertisement Meredith’s restraint appears to have been prescient. Before taking on Time Inc., the company already owned some of the most-read magazines in the country, including Better Homes and Gardens, with its circulation of 7.6 million. In buying the House of Luce, the company gained People, which fits nicely into its portfolio of lifestyle publications, along with Olympian titles like Time, Sports Illustrated and Fortune, which do not match the company’s traditional areas of expertise. Meredith has said that it may not hang on to all of the Time Inc. magazines. Company executives expect to complete their review of the titles this spring. Among the options under consideration are selling off Time and Sports Illustrated, or changing how frequently they are published. Time, for instance, could become a bi-weekly or monthly. For now, Meredith owns 40 magazines to go with its 17 television stations and 50 websites. The Time Inc. deal gave new life to Meredith’s digital and video operations, increasing the number of unique monthly visitors to its websites from 80 million to 170 million. And Meredith officials say the company will generate $700 million in annual digital advertising revenue. Edwin T. Meredith founded Meredith in 1902 with the introduction of Successful Farming, a magazine that is still going strong, with a circulation of about 400,000. His office lay a mile from Meredith’s current headquarters, which houses roughly 1,000 employees. In 1922, after serving as the secretary of agriculture under President Woodrow Wilson, Mr. Meredith introduced Fruit, Garden and Home, later renamed Better Homes and Gardens. After his death, the company went public, moved into the television business and expanded its magazine portfolio with titles including Country Home, Wood and Midwest Living. It has since added Family Circle, Parents, Shape, Allrecipes, Martha Stewart Living and Magnolia Journal, among other publications. The Meredith family remains the company’s biggest individual shareholder, with Mell Meredith Frazier, the founder’s great-granddaughter, serving as the board’s vice chairwoman. Advertisement To make up for the decline in print advertising that has afflicted the industry, Meredith has turned to other sources of revenue, including a retail partnership with Walmart and a Better Homes and Gardens real estate agency. But with a focus on evergreen subjects, it has proved better able to weather the downturn than media companies that chase after the latest news-break or trend. More than 60 percent of Meredith’s $1.7 billion in revenue comes from its magazine business. The company has also been able to keep costs low in a way that executives at the New York-based Condé Nast and Hearst can only envy. “The Midwestern aspect of it — the base of it and the headquarters of it being in Des Moines — I think does infuse the whole company with a kind of Midwestern practicality,” Stephen Orr, the editor in chief of Better Homes and Gardens, said. (Meredith does have a New York office for some sales, marketing and editorial employees. To facilitate travel it owns two nine-seater corporate jets.) The company has also avoided the upheaval that has affected other magazine publishers: Whereas Time Inc. went through five chief executives in the last eight years — “a real problem,” Mr. Lacy said — Meredith is on its fifth since 1971. And so, as many magazine publishers were cutting costs, the company found itself in a position to go big — and elevate its position in the media-industry hierarchy. The acquisition of Time Inc. would not have come about without an infusion of $650 million from Koch Equity Development, the private equity arm of the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch.  . The Koch cash fueled what was Meredith’s third attempt to buy Time Inc. In 2013, a proposed deal collapsed because of Meredith’s lack of interest in Time, Fortune and Sports Illustrated. A second go-round fizzled early in 2017. Mr. Lacy said he kept at it because he saw a chance to broaden Meredith’s digital audience and add balance to a roster heavy on lifestyle titles. “I couldn’t think or come up with another deal that I thought mattered as much to the future of the Meredith Corporation,” he said. Advertisement The deal was something of a last hurrah for Mr. Lacy: In January, he ceded his position as chief executive to the company’s president and chief operating officer, Tom Harty, 55. In his new role as executive chairman, Mr. Lacy said he will communicate more with shareholders, but will also help Mr. Harty with the process of integrating Time Inc. “I’m very involved,” Mr. Lacy said. For much of the 20th century, Time Inc. was at the pinnacle of American media. It had correspondents all over the globe, and its generously compensated editors gazed out over Rockefeller Center from the Time-Life building. When the web’s drumbeat rendered its news-heavy titles all but irrelevant, the company left its namesake building for less opulent headquarters in Lower Manhattan. But it wasn’t enough to stop the bleeding. The Meredith-Time deal closed on Jan. 31. That night workers covered the Time Inc. sign on the building’s glass facade with a Meredith banner. The next morning Mr. Lacy and Mr. Harty shook hands with their new employees, who received Meredith-branded canvas gift bags. The slogan: “Be Bold. Together.” “We’re in it together — that’s what we’re saying,” Mr. Harty said. “We came up with a little tag line. And what we were showing was that we were visible.” In mid-February, a software update scrubbed the default Time Inc. logo from the computers of the roughly 7,000 people who had become Meredith employees. And at the end of February, Meredith announced it had sold Time Inc. U.K. — which comprises some 50 brands, including the design magazine Wallpaper — for an undisclosed sum to the British private equity firm Epiris. It has also begun phasing out Time Inc.’s customer service center in Tampa, Fla. Many analysts and executives in the industry also expect Meredith to sell some of Time Inc.’s news heavy titles, including Time, Sports Illustrated and Fortune. “Meredith has had its sights on Time Inc. for a number of years,” said Reed Phillips, a managing partner at the investment bank Oaklins DeSilva & Phillips. “And it has consistently taken the position that it is not interested in weeklies or men’s magazines.” Mr. Harty said he has yet to decide the fate of the Time Inc. magazines. “No preconceived ideas that we’re going to sell anything,” he said. “But at the same time, as I like to say, everything is for sale at the right price.” On April 24, Meredith will put aside — for one night, at least — its distaste for showiness by entering the realm of New York hype and glamour when it hosts the annual Time 100 Gala at Lincoln Center. Advertisement The company had a brush with being at the red-hot center of media attention last year, when reporters scrutinized its having accepted financial assistance from the Kochs. The coverage came as a surprise to a company accustomed to going about its business quietly. “We weren’t ready for that, and we had to be,” Mr. Harty said. Meredith executives have insisted that the billionaire brothers — known for using their vast wealth and political connections to advance a libertarian brand of conservatism — will have no influence on editorial operations. Most Meredith employees I encountered seemed reluctant to discuss the Time Inc. deal, preferring to extol the company’s “collaborative” culture and the splendors of working more than a thousand miles west of New York. “Des Moines is so much more cultured and so much more to-do than most any New Yorker would ever imagine,” said Mr. Orr, who was the executive editor of Condé Nast Traveler before taking over Better Homes and Gardens in 2015.

13-Mar-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin MARCH 13, 2018
 Good Tuesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Memo to Qualcomm: National champions have to deliver. • How companies are planning on spending their tax savings. • Behind President Trump’s extraordinary block of Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm. • Meet Larry Page’s flying taxi start-up. • And what lies ahead for Goldman Sachs’s presumptive heir. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. President Trump has stepped in to protect Qualcomm from Broadcom, a foreign company that wanted to buy the San Diego-based chip maker. Rather than let market forces decide what should happen in the chip industry, the administration intervened because it had concerns about national security. One of the government's main worries, laid out in a March 5 letter, was that Broadcom would reduce Qualcomm’s spending on research and development, causing Qualcomm to lose ground in the race to develop important new technologies like 5G, which is designed to make wireless networks faster and more reliable. Chinese companies may gain an advantage in 5G, for instance. Advertisement Qualcomm does spend a lot on research and development. In its last fiscal year, the company’s $5.5 billion of research and development outlays were equivalent to 25 percent of its revenue. That was up from 21 percent on average in the preceding five years. According to Qualcomm executives, spending on 5G has driven the increase. Advertisement The big question is what Qualcomm does now. Will the company become less efficient under the government’s protection? Will it be tempted to spend less on research and development? If that spending falls markedly as a percentage of revenue, United States taxpayers may have reason to feel taken advantage of. — Peter Eavis The Trump administration seems to have taken a more activist role in mergers and acquisitions than past administrations. On Monday, President Trump blocked Broadcom’s hostile bid for Qualcomm. The move came just over three months after President Trump’s Justice Department drew plenty of attention for suing to block AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner. That’s roughly $200 billion worth of transactions. But the administration’s oppositions to M.&A. activity goes further, especially when it comes Chinese acquirers. Here’s a look at some of the other deals that ran into problems securing approval from the United States government: • In March, Changnong, a unit of Beijing Dabeinong Technology, scrapped plans to buy Waldo Farms after it failed to obtain United States government approval. • In September, the Trump administration blocks China’s Canyon Bridge Capital Partners’ $1.3 billion bid for Lattice Semiconductor over national security concerns. • In November, Cowen Group called off its deal for CEFC China Energy, a Chinese conglomerate with big investments in oil in Central Africa, to take a 20 percent stake in the New York boutique investment bank, blaming delays and “uncertainty” in securing Cfius approval. Advertisement • In January, MoneyGram and Ant Financial, the Chinese electronic payments company, canceled their $1.2 billion deal after failing to win approval from a Washington panel that reviews foreign purchases of American companies. This approach to deals is a reversal from the stance of past administrations on deal making. Writes Matt Levine of Bloomberg Views: If the shareholders would rather take the money and leave the business’s fate to the acquirer, the governmental reaction has traditionally been “ehh, what are ya gonna do, capitalism.” But now, maybe, not so much? With (selectively) reinvigorated antitrust enforcement, reinvigorated CFIUS review, and a president who sure seems happy to block mergers for political or personal-offense reasons, there are just a lot more ways to stop a merger, if that’s what you are looking to do. A decade ago, Bear Stearns was facing a grave liquidity crisis. Its stock had plummeted more than 20 percent in just days. Investors, as well as clients and broker-dealers, had pulled back from the firm, fearing that their continued exposure to plunging real estate assets threatened their solvency. Amid the chaos, the co-head of Goldman’s investment bank, David Solomon, reached out to an executive at Bear Stearns: 
            Ten years ago today, David Solomon called the CFO of his alma mater firm, Bear Stearns, to offer Goldman’s assistance. #StreetFighters pic.twitter.com/ow2zu6VIUB  The call left Sam Molinaro, Bear’s C.F.O., feeling uneasy. “When Goldman calls and offers their assistance, it's usually a moneymaking opportunity for them,” Mr. Molinaro said. Of course, within days, JPMorgan, with the backing of the Federal Reserve, had stepped in and agreed to acquire Bear for $2 a share. Mr. Solomon, meanwhile, was anointed the heir apparent at Goldman yesterday. When President Trump signed the sweeping tax overhaul into law late last year, he said, “Corporations are literally going wild over this.” We’re not ones to judge whether that’s an overstatement, but a new study has found that, at the least, many plan on going shopping. Here’s what a survey of 500 American companies with sales of at least $500 million by EY found: • 42 percent of respondents intend to use their tax savings on acquisitions • 73 percent of executives said that they will accelerate their M.&A. planning for the year in any case • 69 percent of respondents say that they’re likely to bring back more cash from overseas under the new tax code The responses to survey suggest that many of the predictions for how companies would use the proceeds from the tax overhaul may prove correct. Though many firms garnered headlines for doling out bonuses to employees or raising hourly wages, analysts and economists largely predicted that corporate America would turn to deal-making, dividends or share buybacks as ways to spend their money. Advertisement “At the end of the day, tax is not a driver of M.&A., but it certainly is a key element,” Bill Casey, EY’s Americas vice chair of transaction advisory services, told me. He added that the removal of uncertainty about taxes, as well as the potential benefits from the overhaul, appears to have lifted companies’ deal-making spirits. Not that M.&A. has been bad so far this year. Announced transactions in the United States for the year to date are up 55 percent from the same time last year, according to Thomson Reuters. And Mr. Casey pointed out that companies already have access to plenty of cheap financing to pursue acquisitions. But for mid-market companies especially, extra money in the pocket can help provide an extra shot of confidence. “There’s more capital being fueled by tax reform, and that will ultimately lead to a better deal market,” Mr. Casey said. Other findings from the survey • 75 percent of respondents said that they are likely to grow their United States manufacturing base in some way • 89 percent said that they planned to “enhance compensation” because of forthcoming tax benefits • 38 percent of mid-cap companies plan to create new jobs, compared to only 19 percent of large-caps • 66 percent are likely to pass some tax savings onto customers — Michael de la Merced Few deal makers that Michael has spoken to since last night can recall such a dramatic scenario: The president intervening in a hostile takeover, citing national security reasons. Advertisement President Trump essentially salted the earth for Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm. Broadcom was ordered to “immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover,” and its nominees for Qualcomm’s board, who had stood a good chance of winning most of the seats, were immediately disqualified. What John Kabealo, a specialist in foreign investment law, told Cecilia Kang and Alan Rappeport of the NYT: “It certainly aligns with the administration’s willingness to be more active in trade and implementing protectionist policies,” he said. “It is definitely a much more activist policy than the previous administration.” Scott Kennedy of the Center for Strategic & International Studies told Bloomberg, “This decision hangs a huge ‘not-for-sale’ sign on just about every American semiconductor firm.” Big question 1: Much has been made of this White House’s protectionism. But Cfius, the government panel that reviews deals for national security concerns, cited Broadcom’s “relationships with third-party foreign entities.” What does that mean? Big question 2: Did Broadcom — which sped up its efforts to move its legal headquarters to the U.S. in apparent defiance of Cfius’s orders — misplay this situation? Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . Big question 3: Does any non-U.S. bidder for an American company now need to worry about Cfius? Critics’ corner:  Brook Sutherland of Gadfly warns, “This should be a warning for future deal makers and would-be friends of Trump.” Considering Qualcomm’s prospects now, Lex says the company “has disappointed before — even without the president’s help.” Market reaction Shares of Qualcomm are down 4.5 percent, while Broadcom’s stock rose 1.7 percent. Rival chip maker Intel, which has been considering a number alternatives in response Broadcom’s pursuit of Qualcomm, gained 2.7 percent. Andrew took the wraps off the Alphabet C.E.O.’s well-hidden side project, which aims to be the Uber of self-flying aircraft before Uber can even get there. More from Andrew’s column: On Tuesday, Mr. Page’s company and the prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, will announce they have reached an agreement to test Kitty Hawk’s autonomous planes as part of an official certification process. The hope is that it will lead to a commercial network of flying taxis in New Zealand in as soon as three years. New Zealand has long been seen as safety-conscious, so its regulations for the vehicles could be a model in the U.S. and elsewhere. Now that the Wall Street titan has officially anointed an up-and-coming disc jockey — a.k.a. David Solomon, longtime investment banker — Lloyd Blankfein’s likely successor, it’s worth considering his priorities: From Dakin Campbell of Bloomberg: Blankfein and the board were impressed, insiders say, by Solomon’s proven ability to build businesses, the strength of the deal making team he assembled and his efforts to recruit and retain talent. Those qualities became even more valuable as the bank decided it had focused too much on hedge funds as trading customers, at the expense of corporations. And in an interview with the Virgin Group founder Richard Branson last month, Mr. Solomon suggested that Goldman — which has added consumer lending to its stable of services — “could move in your direction a little bit.” Advertisement The succession race was Wall Street’s most closely watched, with Mr. Solomon, the outsider investment banker, squaring off against a Goldman lifer and veteran trader, his fellow co-president Harvey Schwartz. From Kate Kelly of the NYT: Late last year, Mr. Schwartz approached Goldman’s lead director, the private-equity executive Adebayo O. Ogunlesi, with an ultimatum, according to people familiar with the exchange. Mr. Schwartz said that unless he was tapped as chief executive in the coming months, he would resign. Mr. Ogunlesi was noncommittal, these people said. Peter Eavis’s take: Morgan Stanley has arguably done more than Goldman to diversify away from trading into more stable businesses like wealth management. A stumble for Goldman’s deal business: It’s fifth in Thomson Reuters’s global league tables, behind Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Lazard. As the current front-runner to replace Gary Cohn, the CNBC commentator would become the White House’s top salesman for its economic policies — and one of the top internal supporters of free trade, when protectionism is ascendant. Why Mr. Kudlow, whose last formal Washington job was in the Reagan administration? From Maggie Haberman and Jim Tankersley of the NYT: Mr. Kudlow, who advised Mr. Trump during his campaign and after he became president, is someone with whom Mr. Trump has a rapport, and he is a media personality whom the president enjoys watching on television, according to aides. Just in time: Mr. Kudlow and Stephen Moore have an op-ed in today’s WSJ on the economy. From the piece: “Mr. Trump’s tax-cutting and deregulatory policies are already pushing out the supply curve, creating real growth that isn’t inflationary.” More context: The apparent discarding of the previous front-runner, Chris Liddell, is another blow to Jared Kushner, for whom he worked. The political flyaround • While some Senate Republicans have introduced bills to block President Trump’s proposed tariffs, G.O.P. leaders are unlikely to take them up. European carmakers said the tariffs might lead them reduce investment, and therefore jobs, in the U.S. Advertisement • Mr. Trump abandoned his promise of tougher gun rules opposed by the National Rifle Association, including raising the age limit to buy assault-style rifles.

27-Feb-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin FEB. 27, 2018
 Happy Tuesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Comcast is fighting Fox over the British broadcaster Sky. • How will Powell discuss loose fiscal policy? • Delta shows pushing back against the N.R.A. has political costs. • Will the U.S. challenge Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm on national security grounds? Want this in your inbox? Sign up here. Comcast may have found a way to disrupt Walt Disney’s deal for a large part of 21st Century Fox: make a bid to buy the British satellite broadcaster Sky. The offer, writes Liam Proud of Breakingviews, leaves Fox with two unappealing options to save its deal with Disney. Rupert Murdoch can either “revise the terms of the Disney sale to exclude Sky, or enter into a bidding war with” Comcast. Advertisement Sky investors seem to be betting on the latter option. Its stock jumped nearly 20 percent and is now trading above Comcast’s offer. Advertisement The reason for that may be that “both Fox and Disney have reasons for wanting to possess all of Sky,” writes Chris Hughes of Bloomberg Gadfly. “Fox may want full ownership as an insurance policy against the sale to Disney failing. And Disney’s desire to buy Fox’s current stake in Sky suggests it likes the asset, wants more of it and would want to prevent Comcast owning it.” In fact, Robert Iger, Disney’s chief executive, has called Sky the crown jewel of his company’s purchase of Fox assets. Reaction • Frank Louthan, an analyst at Raymond James: “The potential for Fox to return and make a competing bid remains high, in our view, as our European investment team believes Sky is the best-in-class European leader in Pay-TV.” When is an offer an offer can be a fine point under Britain’s complicated takeover rules. On Tuesday, Comcast announced a “possible all-cash offer” to acquire Sky, the British satellite broadcaster, for about $31 billion . Sky and 21st Century Fox, which has been trying to acquire the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own for more than year, both responded that “no firm offer” had been made. That may seem like an odd distinction when Comcast, the owner of NBCUniversal, announced publicly how much it is willing to pay for an asset to kick off negotiations. But, that comes down to Britain’s extensive takeover code, which spans more than 400 pages, and can often trip up American companies not used to operating under those rules. The public disclosure of merger talks is triggered under the code when a number of factors occur, such as rumors in the market that a deal is in the works or “untoward movement” in a takeover target’s stock price. Advertisement Making a public announcement then starts a countdown clock for a potential acquirer to announce a formal offer under the rules, known as a so-called firm intention to make an offer. The rules are intended to make sure all shareholders are treated fairly and have access to the same information about a deal and to establish an orderly framework for takeovers. - Chad Bray We’d waited to see if Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chairman and C.E.O., would challenge Walt Disney for control of 21st Century Fox. Instead, he plans to disrupt Mr. Murdoch’s bid for full control of Sky, the British satellite broadcaster. What Comcast is offering: £12.50, or about $17.50, a share for all of Sky What Fox is offering: £10.75 a share for the 61 percent of Sky that it doesn’t own Behind the maneuvers Comcast had worked on its own offer for Fox, with the chance to expand internationally through Sky being a big reason for bidding. But the Murdochs and their advisers believed that it would be difficult for Comcast to win U.S. regulatory approval. However, Fox’s bid for Sky has been held up by questions by British regulators about whether Mr. Murdoch was fit and proper to control a major broadcaster in the U.K. That presented Comcast’s opportunity. What Mr. Roberts said in Comcast’s regulatory statement: “We already have a strong presence in London, and Comcast intends to use Sky as a platform for our growth in Europe.” Whom to thank for the Comcast bid 
            Someone needs to find this cabbie pic.twitter.com/lH4SFcggcp  Critics’ corner • Paul Richards of the media research firm Numis told the FT that Comcast’s bid is a “very strong competitive offer.” Advertisement • Alex DeGroote at Cenkos Securities told Bloomberg, “The market was anticipating another approach and will be pleasantly surprised.” Market reaction Comcast investors don’t seem pleasantly surprised. Shares of Comcast are down 5.2 percent. Sky’s stock popped nearly 20 percent and is now trading above Comcast’s offer. When Jerome H. Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday, we may see if he has mastered the art of stern but subtle disapproval. Congress has recently enacted tax cuts and spending increases that could stimulate the economy at a time when the Fed may want to tamp things down a bit. A tug of war could end up occurring between elected politicians wanting a boom to continue and a central bank that is concerned about government deficits and inflation. It is highly unlikely that Mr. Powell or any other Fed official would want to get drawn into a direct, public fight with members of Congress or the administration of President Donald Trump. So, how might Mr. Powell express concern about loose government fiscal policies? He can talk about Congress’s stimulus as just one of many factors that can have an impact on the Fed’s mission of creating the economic conditions for maximum employment and stable prices. In other words, he could depersonalize any tensions, and imply that concern about spending and deficits is just the Fed doing its job. And in his prepared testimony for the hearing, Mr. Powell noted the stimulus from fiscal policy. “In gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the F.O.M.C. will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing P.C.E. price inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis. While many factors shape the economic outlook, some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds: In particular, fiscal policy has become more stimulative and foreign demand for U.S. exports is on a firmer trajectory.” (F.O.M.C. is the Federal Open Market Committee, the committee that sets monetary policy, while P.C.E. price inflation is the Fed’s preferred measure of prices, derived from a survey of personal consumption expenditures conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.) Update from the hearing In this testimony before the House committee on Tuesday, Mr. Powell took some questions about the recent loosening of fiscal policy, and how the Fed might respond. Advertisement He followed the careful path outlined above. On the one hand, he noted that government finances can have an impact on economic conditions, saying: “Fiscal policy changes can have an effect.” He also said: “We really need to get on a sustainable fiscal path, and the time for doing that is now.” On the other hand, Mr. Powell said the Fed did not want to directly interfere in government spending decisions. “We don’t do fiscal policy at the Fed,” he said. — Peter Eavis That’s according to GeekWire and confirmed by CNBC.

21-Feb-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin FEB. 21, 2018
 Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • What it takes to be a whistle-blower. • Broadcom whacks Qualcomm for raising its NXP bid. • Untangling the productivity mystery. • How Skadden got involved in the special counsel’s Russia inquiry. Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. Sigmund Freud is reputed to have said that “sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.” The Supreme Court took that approach in deciding what is required to qualify for protection from retaliation as a whistle-blower. A provision in the Dodd-Frank Act defines a “whistle-blower” as someone who provides “information relating to a violation of the securities laws to the Commission.” That seems simple enough, but the Securities and Exchange Commission made something of a hash out of the requirement by taking an expansive view in a rule aimed at protecting an employee from retaliation even if the person only reports information internally. Advertisement In Digital Realty Trust v. Somers, a former employee of Digital Realty, Paul Somers, claimed he was terminated after he reported possible securities law violations to senior management. Although he never alerted anyone outside the company, Mr. Somers filed a lawsuit claiming his termination violated the anti-retaliation provision by relying on the S.E.C.’s rule. Advertisement The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, rejected that reading of the statute. It applied a simple analysis: “Courts are not at liberty to dispense with the condition—tell the S.E.C.—Congress imposed.” By not reporting his suspicions to the S.E.C., he lost the protection afforded whistleblowers. One of the complaints expressed by companies when the S.E.C. considered the whistle-blower rules was that they did not require employees to report information to management first. The incentive created by the Digital Realty ruling is straightforward: Don’t just tell your boss about possible violations; make a beeline to the S.E.C.’s front door, at least if you want protection from retaliation. — Peter J. Henning The Dow Jones industrial average rose 139 points in the half-hour after the Federal Reserve released the minutes of its most recent policy meeting at 2 p.m. and was up more than 300 points on the day. Then the index sank 455 points in the final 90 minutes to close down 0.67 percent for the day. Why? There didn’t appear to be anything in the minutes to make investors particularly bearish or bullish. Perhaps the bond market was to blame for the plunge. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which rises as its price falls, kept climbing after the minutes came out, closing at 2.95 percent. Higher bond yields can make stocks look more expensive, prompting investors to sell. As a result, Wednesday’s mini move indicates that the tug of war between the stock and bond markets is still very much on. While we’re on the Fed minutes, it appears that the central bank’s policymakers did not spend much time discussing an indicator that is flashing a warning sign. The data point in question is the saving rate, which recently sank to a 12-year low. With the rate at 2.4 percent of disposable income, a big drop in the stock market, like the one that occurred earlier this month, could prompt consumers to cut their spending. The Fed’s policymakers did not appear overly worried about the saving rate at their last meeting, which was held before the market’s plunge. The minutes state: In connection with solid growth in consumer spending, a couple of participants noted that the household saving rate had declined to its lowest level since 2005, likely driven by buoyant consumer sentiment or expectations that the rise in household wealth would be sustained. — Peter Eavis Qualcomm defied Broadcom’s demand not to raise its takeover bid for NXP on Tuesday by increasing that offer by about 16 percent, to $127.50 a share from $110. Now Broadcom has retaliated. Broadcom shaved $3 per share off its hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm, to $79. Broadcom’s rationale is that the new NXP offer transfers value away from Qualcomm’s shareholders. From the news release: Broadcom believes that a responsible Qualcomm board could have preserved value by following ISS’s clear recommendation to work with Broadcom on the NXP transaction and negotiate the sale of Qualcomm to Broadcom. Instead Qualcomm’s board acted against the best interests of its stockholders by unilaterally transferring excessive value to NXP’s activist stockholders. Let’s take a look at the math Advertisement • Broadcom argues that Qualcomm gave up $4.10 a share, or $6.2 billion, in value to NXP shareholders. In response, it cut its price. At $79 a share, Broadcom’s current offer is just under 13 percent higher than its original offer. (Of course, other elements of Broadcom’s last bid — the $8 billion breakup fee for antitrust reasons, the ticking fee if a deal takes more than 12 months to close — still stand.) • Broadcom also contends privately that had Qualcomm agreed to start deal talks, the two of them could have held firm against NXP shareholders like Elliott Management and Soroban Capital Partners. By giving up less negotiating power to the holdout shareholders, the argument goes, Qualcomm could have recut the NXP deal at a far lower price. • Qualcomm argues privately that the $4.10 a share is nonsense, since the NXP deal a) wasn’t going to get done at $110 a share and b) will still add to its earnings per share price starting in the 2019 fiscal year. The bet on the shareholder meeting Broadcom had previously said that it would walk away if the NXP offer went above $110 a share, but now seems content to take its chances at Qualcomm’s annual shareholder meeting. Broadcom wants six seats on Qualcomm’s board. That campaign gained momentum when the proxy advisers I.S.S. and Glass Lewis recommended that Qualcomm shareholders vote for at least four of its director nominees. A Qualcomm representative didn’t have an immediate comment. How the shares moved today: Qualcomm’s were down 1.5 percent, while Broadcom’s were up slightly. Shares in NXP — the real winner in this deal saga so far — were essentially unchanged. — Michael de la Merced The deals flyaround • Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason pressed Xerox to pursue alternatives to its complicated deal with Fujifilm. (Reuters) • HNA has borrowed from the private equity firm Pacific Alliance Group, a sign that it may be struggling to raise capital from more traditional sources. (FT) 
            But might the return to full employment fuel a rebound?         FEB. 20, 2018
 An economy is doing well when companies each year manage to become more productive, or in other words, get more output from their employees and equipment. But productivity for years has grown far more slowly than it did in the past, effectively restraining economic growth. This decline has prompted economists to hunt for causes – and the latest big work on the issue comes from the McKinsey Global Institute. The Upshot’s Neil Irwin does a great job of explaining McKinsey’s main finding: The latest wrinkle is that the researchers now believe that productivity growth depends not just on the supply side of the economy — what companies produce and what technologies they use to do it — but also significantly on the demand side. That is to say, productivity advancements don’t happen in a vacuum just because technology is available. They also happen because companies need to increase production to match demand for their goods, and a shortage, either of workers or of materials, forces them to think creatively about how to do so. Little in economics is straightforward, however, and McKinsey’s deep dive prompted a couple of questions. Jaana Remes, one of the authors of the work, was kind enough to respond. Advertisement 1) In its report, McKinsey notes that the slow down in productivity growth was noticeable before the financial crisis. What caused that? And to what degree did those causes contribute to the decline in productivity growth after the financial crisis? This is important because these forces could continue to weigh on productivity. In the years leading up to 2008, the productivity improvements that started in the 1990s with the introduction of information technology were largely complete, Ms. Remes explains. Important new technologies can often take well over 10 years to have a big impact on productivity, she adds. The optimistic take, though, is that we can in the coming years expect to see big benefits as companies further automate, and introduce artificial intelligence. 2) If a sluggish economy can create the conditions for weak productivity, why did France, Spain and Italy, whose economies were anemic in the period under study, have significantly better productivity performances than faster-growing countries? First, the numbers: From 2010 to 2014, labor productivity grew by 1.4 percent a year in Spain and 1 percent in France, well in excess of the negative 0.2 percent rate for Britain and the United States. Why was that? Because Britain and the United States had made superior productivity gains before 2010. That made it harder for the two countries to notch similarly strong productivity growth in the years after the financial crisis. By contrast, France and Spain, which had made far fewer productivity gains before 2010, were able to eke out at least some afterward. Ms. Remes also points out that a big cause of Spain’s post-2010 gain came from a reduction in hours worked. That might be described as the least desirable way to bolster productivity because it implies a reduction in incomes for workers. The most economically beneficial type of productivity gain occurs when output per employee increases as hours worked grow. — Peter Eavis New research posted by France’s central bank, the Banque de France, shows that the largest companies in the United States now account for a significantly larger share of production. This dominance, the paper asserts, could allow the companies to enjoy “monopoly rents,” the term economists use to describe the subsidies companies enjoy if their business is protected in ways that are not available to other firms. “If these firms hold a dominant position in their market, they enjoy monopoly rents and have little incentive to invest in order to increase their productive capacities. This behavior could explain the weakness of investment in recent years, despite the high rates of return on capital.” David Wessel, writing for Harvard Business Review, also recently took a look at whether dominant companies are holding the economy back. — Peter Eavis The largest United States bank by assets announced that it plans to tear down its current headquarters at 270 Park Ave. and build 2.5 million square-foot modern tower in its place. Advertisement The new headquarters has yet to be designed, but it is expected, according to Bloomberg, to be between 70 and 75 stories and house 15,000 employees. The current headquarters was designed in the late 1950s for about 3,500 employees, JPMorgan said. During construction, employees will be temporarily moved 237, 245 and 277 Park Ave. and 383 and 390 Madison Ave., Bloomberg reported citing a person familiar with the matter. The tower would be the first major project under New York City’s Midtown East rezoning plan, designed to encourage office construction in the area. The job recruiting site said Wednesday that it has hired Jim Cox as its C.F.O., as part of a series of high-level executive appointments. Mr. Cox was most recently at Lithium Technologies, a maker of customer relationship management software. Here’s what Robert Hohman, Glassdoor’s C.E.O. and co-founder, said: “We are pleased to welcome Jim to Glassdoor as our new CFO as he brings a proven track record of building and managing financial operations and teams at high-growth technology companies.” Glassdoor also appointed Christian Sutherland-Wong, most recently its general manager of monetization, as its first chief operating officer, and Samantha Zupan, a longtime executive, as its vice president of global corporate communications. — Michael de la Merced The giant law firm’s work for the former Trump campaign manager — who has been charged with several criminal acts by Robert Mueller’s inquiry into Russian election interference — has come into question after a former Skadden associate entered a guilty plea in the investigation. Advertisement More from Kenneth Vogel and Andrew Kramer of the NYT: The interest from prosecutors in what Skadden did for the Ukrainian government is one indication of the wide-ranging nature of the inquiries related to Mr. Manafort. It also highlights the risks associated with advising authoritarian governments overseas, a lucrative sideline among Washington lawyers, lobbyists and public relations consultants. Skadden’s response: It fired the associate in question, Alex van der Zwaan, last year, and is cooperating with Mr. Mueller’s team. Elsewhere in Russian election meddling: Here’s what we still don’t know about Facebook’s role. Chris Hughes, a co-founder, said Facebook must do more to prevent foreign interference. President Trump blamed Barack Obama for not being tougher on Russia. And meet the  oligarch who helped fund Russia’s troll agency. The judge overseeing the Justice Department’s lawsuit to block the $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner denied AT&T’s request to see government communications about the case. He ruled that AT&T had not “made a credible showing” that the White House had singled it out for retribution. More from Cecilia Kang of the NYT: The decision puts a crimp in AT&T’s defense for its $85 billion proposed merger with Time Warner. And it is a big win for the Justice Department, which would like to avoid attention on the role of politics in its decision to stop the deal. AT&T had already agreed to take the Justice Department’s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, off the witness list — but could call him during the trial if needed. Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . The trial begins March 19.

It is funneling billions of dollars from its subscribers to music companies, which, for the most part, faced a bleak future. But a charity Spotify is not. The company appears to be taking a bigger and bigger cut of the revenue it receives from listeners, according to numbers first made public on Wednesday. Advertisement The numbers are included in Spotify’s financial filing with Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of listing its shares on the United States stock market. They strongly suggest that Spotify has successfully flexed its muscle as it negotiates the price it pays record companies for music. This shows up starkly in the filing’s discussion of an expense item called cost of revenues, which, the filing says, “consists predominately of royalty and distribution costs related to content streaming.” Advertisement The filing says Spotify had €3.67 billion of premium streaming revenue last year. The cost of that revenue last year was €2.87 billion. The difference between those numbers, the gross profit on streaming revenue, was equivalent to 22 percent of that revenue. That is well up from 16 percent in 2016 and 15 percent in 2015. And how did Spotify bolster its margins? A big factor: It signed more advantageous licensing agreements with music companies. “This decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of premium revenue was driven largely by a reduction in content costs pursuant to new licensing agreements,” the filing said. But can Spotify keep turning the screw? The music companies might be willing to compromise on price because the overall amount of dollars they receive is going up, making life easier for the first time in years. But, with Apple, Amazon and others adding subscribers, competition is intensifying. The music industry might be able to exploit that. — Peter Eavis Accounting nerds delving into Spotify’s filing will have stumbled on an odd discrepancy. Two metrics that attempt to capture how much cash a company is taking in had very different totals for 2017. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was negative to the tune of €324 million last year. But net cash flows from operations totaled €179 million in 2017. Both totals benefited from adding back large noncash financing costs. So what items bolstered operating cash flows but not Ebitda? It looks like operating cash flows did better in part because Spotify waited to pay some of its bills. Such items make up what is often called working capital. Spotify wrung €439 million of cash out of working capital in 2017. The question for investors is whether the company can do that every year. — Peter Eavis The streaming music service filed its prospectus for a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange, an unusual route that bypasses the traditional initial public offering process. Direct listings essentially move trading in a company’s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market. Advertisement Wall Street and Silicon Valley will watch Spotify’s listing closely. If it goes well, it could spur other high profile start-ups to pursue a direct listing. Wall Street bankers are unlikely to cheer such a development. Direct listings generate lower fees than the typical I.P.O. Spotify won’t embark on its roadshow, a series of meetings with investor ahead of the listing, for at least 15 days. Here’s a look at the details: Ticker symbol: SPOT Price range for private shares in 2017:  $37.50-$125.00  Price range for private shares this year:  $90.00-$132.50 Valuation range in 2017: $6.3 billion to $20.9 billion Valuation range this year: $15.9 billion to $23.4 billion Valuation based on the midpoint of its 2018 price range: $19.7 billion Loss: €1.2 billion in 2017, up from €225 million in 2015 Operating loss: €378 million, compared with €235 million in 2015. Revenue: €4.1 billion last year, up from €1.9 billion in 2015. Free cash flow: €109 million in 2017 Ebitda: -€324 million in 2017 Monthly average users: 159 million last year, up from 91 million in 2015 Premium subscribers: 71 million, up from 28 million in 2015 Share of global streaming music market: 42 percent Advertisement The amount Spotify has paid in royalties to record labels since its inception: More than $8 billion Percent of total voting power controlled by co-founder and chief executive, Daniel Ek: 37.3 percent Percent of total voting power controlled by co-founder, Martin Lorentzon: 43.1 percent Risks of a direct listing: “Our ability to sell your ordinary shares at or above the price you bought them for due to (i) our listing not having the same safeguards as an underwritten initial public offering, which may result in the public price of our ordinary shares being volatile and declining significantly upon listing, or (ii) the failure of an active, liquid, and orderly market for our ordinary shares to develop or be sustained.” Despite a sharp selloff in financial markets in early February, the market for public offerings started 2018 with a bang. Through late February, 30 companies publicly listed their shares on markets in the United States, raising $11.4 billion from investors. That was the strongest annual start for the market since 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters. The pipeline of listings to come is also strong. On top of Spotify’s listing, which should come in the next few weeks, Dropbox filed paperwork last week to go public. One of the U.S.’s biggest gun sellers, Dick’s Sporting Goods, said that it would stop selling assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines, as well as limit sales of any gun to those 21 and older. In doing so, the retailer is steering directly into the controversy that has embroiled companies that have taken on the American gun lobby. Dick’s C.E.O., Edward Stack, told the NYT: “When we saw what happened in Parkland, we were so disturbed and upset. We love these kids and their rallying cry, ‘enough is enough.’ It got to us.” What’s next: Mr. Stack wants what he calls “common sense” changes to gun laws, like the steps his company is taking and broader universal background checks. Advertisement Why it’s remarkable:  Other companies, big and small, continue to sever ties to the National Rifle Association. Delta has been openly dressed down — and potentially punished — by Republicans in Georgia after eliminating discounts for N.R.A. members. (Gun control is certainly a hot topic in the midterm election campaign.) And then there’s this: FedEx and UPS are feuding over ties to the N.R.A. Over five years ago, Bill Ackman boldly announced that he was shorting Herbalife, declaring the company a pyramid scheme and vowing to see its stock price down to zero. Today, Mr. Ackman finally gave up on that quest. The Pershing Square Capital Management chief told CNBC that his firm had finally exited the short bet. That’s after: • Mr. Ackman’s frenemy, Dan Loeb, took the other side of that bet. • So did Carl Icahn, in one of the most prominent public spats in recent Wall Street history, before the two men made up. (That didn’t stop Mr. Icahn from continuing to bet on Herbalife.) How did Herbalife investors respond Wednesday? They pushed shares in the company up 8.5 percent to $94.04, an all-time high. But Mr. Ackman has found a new investment: United Technologies. Why? The hedge fund mogul told CNBC that he liked the company — which happens to be considering spinning off parts of itself as a way to get more value for the conglomerate’s shareholders. Shares in United Technologies were up 2.1 percent this afternoon, at $136.73. — Michael de la Merced For months, the former real estate investor’s inability to get a permanent top-secret security clearance has been a lightning rod for criticism. Now his interim credentials have been docked to secret and his West Wing portfolio clipped — and people are asking what happened. Advertisement One thing that has come up, per the WaPo, citing unidentified U.S. officials: Officials in China, Israel, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates have discussed how to manipulate him by taking advantage of his business dealings and complicated finances. Speaking of the Kushner business: It’s is in talks to buy Vornado out of 666 Fifth Ave., the troubled Manhattan skyscraper that the two own, according to the WSJ. Critics will ask, where would the money come from? Is it scaring off users? So far the answer seems to be no. CNBC reports Snap’s download rates have remained strong, according to App Annie. And Snap’s shares are up 5 percent. Background Snap’s redesign, which has been rolling out over the past few months, has faced growing criticism from users and weighed on the stock. Last week a tweet from Kylie Jenner, saying she did not open Snapchat, sent the stock tumbling 6 percent. Wall Street has picked up on the customer backlash and a couple of analysts have downgraded the stock. The criticism has also overshadowed Snap’s positive fourth-quarter results earlier this month that pushed its shares up nearly 50 percent. BlackRock thinks that could be a risk to its business. From the risk factors in BlackRock’s annual report: As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of third-party commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing, as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries, known as “common ownership”. The commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows, create stock price bubbles, or conversely, exacerbate a decline in market prices. The filing goes on to say: If the conclusions advanced by such commentators were to gain traction or result in the enactment of policy measures that place limits on asset managers, BlackRock’s business operations, reputation or financial condition may be adversely affected. That is how John D. Herrmann, an analyst who covers the bond markets for MUFG Securities Americas, reacted to the testimony in Congress of Jerome Powell. In a note to clients yesterday, Mr. Herrmann cataloged upbeat remarks that Mr. Powell made, and observed that Mr. Powell seemed optimistic not just about the current economic environment, but also the outlook for the next three to four years. What to make of Wall Street’s response to Mr. Powell? One interpretation is that Mr. Powell wants investors and others to be more prepared for higher interest rates. Wall Street seems to have settled on a scenario in which the Fed raises interest rates steadily over the next two years.

Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. The Trump administration has mostly taken a softer stance toward Wall Street, but on Wednesday, it suggested a regulatory change designed to make life harder for the big banks. Advertisement The change, proposed by the Treasury Department, is arcane, but in a financial crisis, it could be hugely consequential. Advertisement What is it? The tweak aims to increase the likelihood that a failing bank would be forced into bankruptcy, rather than into a resolution process overseen by the government. The difference might seem insignificant, especially since the current regulatory procedures for winding down a bank, introduced by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, are stringent and mimic bankruptcy. But the Treasury Department believes that an actual bankruptcy would be preferable. It would make the process of restructuring a failed bank more evenhanded and predictable, according to the Treasury. In turn, investors in the big Wall Street firms, and anyone doing business with them, would become more aware of the losses they could suffer if those firms crashed. But didn’t the financial crisis of 2008 illustrate the grave dangers of allowing a large bank to go into bankruptcy? The disorderly collapse of Lehman Brothers into bankruptcy set off a panic across the global financial system, according to most analyses of the period. And that is why the Dodd-Frank Act set up a way for regulators to seize a large bank and restructure it in a controlled manner, known as the orderly liquidation authority. As with bankruptcy, it envisions making creditors the new owners of a restructured firm. But it added a feature to limit panic. Under Dodd-Frank, regulators can lend to the failed bank. Such a backstop could prevent a further run on the bank. Its customers and creditors would see that the seized bank had sufficient funds to pay them. The government lending mimics the loans that banks make to bankrupt companies. How much of this does the Treasury want to do away with? Not much at all. It recommends using the Dodd-Frank resolution framework “as an emergency tool for use in extraordinary circumstances.” But that’s how the backers of Dodd-Frank saw the process, too. Crucially, the Treasury also wants to keep the emergency government loan. But the Treasury’s proposal does introduce an important and innovative change. It calls for a special type of bankruptcy regime for large financial firms, called Chapter 14. This new regime envisions having a set of specialist judges, working with regulators in the United States and around the world, who could plan for and oversee the bankruptcies of large banks. Would Chapter 14 work in a crisis? Much depends on whether the customers and creditors of the failing bank yank their money, intensifying the run and spreading fear through the system. The Treasury argues that changes since the crisis mean banks have more cash on hand, and banks can now hold off for a short time on paying claims on financial instruments called derivatives (recall, such claims were particularly debilitating for Lehman.) Also, banks must now have detailed plans to put themselves into bankruptcy, though the Treasury last year suggested changes that might make that planning less stringent. Notably, the Treasury hopes to make Chapter 14 effective by deploying a method for restructuring a failed bank that regulators already expect to use under the orderly liquidation authority. This approach rests on turning pre-existing debt owed by a bank’s holding company into new equity at the subsidiaries where the bank does all its business. The theory: If a reassuringly large amount of new equity were created at the subsidiaries, the banks’ creditors and trading partners would feel protected and not withdraw. Indeed, the Treasury says this would eliminate the incentive for counterparties to run. Eliminate is a strong word. In the heat of a crisis, when the scale of a bank’s losses is not known, making it hard to know how much new equity is needed, creditors and trading partners may just head for the exits, crippling the bank. Even so, Aaron Klein, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, said it made a lot of sense to enshrine this formal wind-down procedure in bankruptcy. “Why wouldn’t you want to make bankruptcy better?” he said. And there’s a big reason it might work. Under post-crisis rules, banks must earmark billions of dollars of debt that would be used for creating new equity in a resolution. Put another way, Dodd-Frank has made it possible for the Trump administration to pursue a favored policy goal. Advertisement — Peter Eavis Shares of the social media company tumbled 7.4 percent Thursday after Kylie Jenner tweeted that she no longer opens Snapchat. 
            sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me... ugh this is so sad.         The tweet comes as Snap faces growing criticism from users over the redesign of its app. So far nearly 1.5 million people have retweeted a petition asking Snap to revert to the old version, CNBC reported. Earlier this week analysts at Citi became the latest to downgrade the stock over the negative reaction. Mark May of Citi wrote: “While the recent redesign of its flagship app could produce positive long-term benefits, the significant jump in negative app reviews since the redesign was pushed out a few weeks could result in a decline in users and user engagement, which could negatively impact financial results.” European banks with significant operations in New York and other parts of the United States have seen multi-billion dollar hits on their results in the fourth quarter as a result. Changes in corporate tax rates have forced European lenders – and their American counterparts – to recognize so-called deferred tax assets at the end of last year. But, the pain is expected to be short term as most banks, including Barclays and UBS, anticipate the tax rate for their United States operations will be lower future. As earnings season edges toward a close, here is the impact on some of Europe’s largest lenders: • Barclays reported an annual loss of 1.9 billion pounds, or about $2.7 billion after it took a series of charges, including £900 million related to tax changes in the United States. “Given the group’s substantial U.S. operations, this is expected to result in a reduction of the group’s effective tax rate in 2018 and future periods to mid-20 percent,” the bank said on Thursday. • Credit Suisse reported a loss of 2.13 billion Swiss francs, or about $2.3 billion, in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by 2.23 billion francs in income tax expenses related to the reassessment of its deferred tax assets. Advertisement • Deutsche Bank reported a full-year loss of 497 million euros, or about $612 million. John Cryan, the Deutsche Bank chief executive, said: “Only a charge related to US tax reform at the end of the year meant that we had to post a full-year after-tax loss.” • HSBC reported a pretax profit of $17.2 billion for 2017, but took a charge of $1.3 billion to reflect a reevaluation of its deferred tax balances. • Société Générale said its profit was dragged down in the quarter after it was hit by restructuring charges related to its French retail banking network and the impact of tax reforms in France and in the United States. • UBS fell to a loss in the fourth quarter as a result of a writedown of 2.87 billion francs on deferred tax assets. Keep an eye out for Standard Chartered when it reports its annual results next week. The bank, which is based in Britain, but makes most of its money in Asia, has been recently touting its ability to serve the North American market. — Chad Bray According to the Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, it requires telling the Securities and Exchange Commission, not just your bosses. More from Andrew Ackerman of the WSJ: The case stems from a lawsuit filed by a would-be whistle-blower, Paul Somers, who says he was fired from Digital Realty Trust in 2014 after complaining internally about accounting irregularities, among other matters. Mr. Somers argued he was protected by Dodd-Frank even though he didn’t report the alleged problems to the S.E.C. Peter Henning’s take The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, rejected that reading of the statute. It applied a simple analysis: “Courts are not at liberty to dispense with the condition — tell the S.E.C. — Congress imposed.” By not reporting his suspicions to the S.E.C., he lost the protection afforded whistle-blowers. The maker of Sharpie markers and Elmer’s glue said today that it was adding three new directors amid its fight with Starboard. They are: • James Craigie, the chairman and former C.E.O. of Church & Dwight, the maker of Arm & Hammer • Debra Crew, the former C.E.O. of Reynolds American, the tobacco company • Judith Sprieser, a former C.E.O. of Transora, a services provider for packaged goods companies (who will be nominated at the company’s upcoming annual meeting) Advertisement What Newell said of the move: These actions are part of Newell Brands’ ongoing refreshment process on behalf of shareholders designed to build a board with the best mix of skills, expertise and experience to support the Newell Brands’ leadership team in accelerating shareholder value creation. What it didn’t say: That this was a response to Starboard, which has criticized Newell’s management team — and is seeking to replace the company’s entire board. — Michael de la Merced Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s biggest hedge fund, thinks so. Last week, Mr. Dalio said: “The risks of a recession in the next 18-24 months are rising.” Now he says there is a 70 percent chance of one before the next presidential election in 2020, according to Reuters. During an appearance Wednesday at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics, Mr. Dalio said: “I think we are in a pre-bubble stage that could go into a bubble stage ... The probability of a recession prior to the next presidential election would be relatively high, maybe 70 percent.” Broadcom didn’t walk away after Qualcomm raised its takeover bid for NXP Semiconductor, but it did lower its own proposal by $3 a share, to $79. Why? Because the new NXP offer transferred $4.10 per Qualcomm share to NXP investors. Qualcomm responded that the move “made an inadequate offer even worse,” and argued that the NXP deal couldn’t have gotten done at the original price of $110 a share. Looks like we’re headed to a showdown at Qualcomm’s annual meeting on March 6.

 Good Friday. Here’s what we’re watching today: • Is Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, planning on stepping down? • The list of those hoping Broadcom fails in its pursuit of Qualcomm keeps growing. • When will wage growth pick up? • Senator Elizabeth Warren has some questions for Apollo and Citi. • How much is Martin Shkreli’s Wu-Tang album worth? • The Trump tariffs have many exceptions. . Don’t already get this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here. Advertisement The Wall Street Journal reported that Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, will step down “as soon as the end of the year,” citing anonymous sources. Advertisement But some important context is necessary: Neither Mr. Blankfein nor the board has set a timeline for him to step down, people briefed on the matter said. Mr. Blankfein has not discussed the possibility of leaving at the end of the year, these people said, though there is a general view that he likely would retire in the next couple of years. And it is very possible that this story may force Mr. Blankfein to move faster to explicitly lay out a timeline than he had originally planned. Is it possible that Mr. Blankfein would step down at the end of 2018? Sure. It is absolutely a possibility, these people said. But it is hardly a certainty. And it is also a possibility that he could step down as C.E.O. but remain chairman, the people said. Is it possible that he could still be at Goldman for part or all of 2019? Sure, these people said. But that’s not a certainty either. Is it possible he is at Goldman in 2020?  That’s less likely, these people agree. Goldman’s board has held discussions about who should succeed Mr. Blankfein ever since Gary Cohn left the firm at the end of 2016, these people said. The board has designated Harvey Schwartz and David Solomon as likely successors, but has not set a specific date for when they need to decide on who will take the reins, these people said. Both men have privately been making plans to take over, these people said. — Andrew Ross Sorkin Here’s Mr. Blankfein’s response to the WSJ story: 
            It's the @WSJ's announcement...not mine. I feel like Huck Finn listening to his own eulogy.         The order President Trump signed on Thursday imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum provided him with wiggle room to exempt countries down the road. In fact, even before signing the order, he suggested the possibility of later excluding allies like Australia. Well, that seems like more of possibility now. Late Friday President Trump said he is working with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on an agreement so Australia will not be subject to the tariffs. 
            Spoke to PM @TurnbullMalcolm of Australia. He is committed to having a very fair and reciprocal military and trade relationship. Working very quickly on a security agreement so we don’t have to impose steel or aluminum tariffs on our ally, the great nation of Australia!         The Wall Street Journal reports that Intel “is considering a range of acquisition alternatives in reaction to Broadcom’s hostile pursuit for Qualcomm.” Advertisement Those options include a possible bid for Broadcom, the WSJ reports citing anonymous sources. Shares of Broadcom jumped 5 percent after hours. Details from the WSJ • Intel is worried about the competitive threat a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm would pose. • Intel has been weighing its options since late last year and has engaged advisers. • Intel might make a bid if Broadcom looks likely to succeed in its pursuit of Qualcomm. Caveats • Any move from Intel is far from certain and one of WSJ’s sources said it is unlikely. Context Washington isn’t so sure a merger of Broadcom and Qualcomm is a good idea. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government panel that reviews transactions’ national security implications, moved to stall the potential takeover of Qualcomm The panel’s intervention put Broadcom’s bid in jeopardy. In practice, reviews by Cfius often lead to the demise of deals. MARCH 9, 2018
 The February jobs report is in. The number of jobs added was the strongest in two years, but wage growth remained lackluster. Advertisement Here are the numbers: • 313,000 jobs were added last month, the most since October 2015. Economists had anticipated a gain of about 200,000. • With revisions to previous months, the three-month average job growth was 242,000 a month. • The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent, the same as in January. • The average hourly wage grew by 0.1 percent. It grew by 0.3 percent in January. The year-over-year increase fell to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent. • The labor force grew by 806,000, pushing the labor force participation rate back up to the 63 percent mark. MARCH 9, 2018
 Context A leap in job gains in February clears the way for the Federal Reserve to raise the benchmark interest rate when it meets this month. The wage figures were disappointing. The jump in hourly earnings in January — which pushed the year-over-year figure to 2.9 percent, from 2.3 percent just three months earlier — was cited as a cause of a market sell-off. With February’s puny growth of 0.1 percent, the year-over-year increase dropped to 2.6 percent. MARCH 9, 2018
 Investors could not have asked for much more from Friday’s jobs report. The numbers for February show the United States economy was able to add a surprisingly large number of new jobs without creating the sort of surge in wages that can prompt investors to worry about inflation. The 10-year Treasury note, which might have sold off on inflation fears, barely budged when the report came out. Futures markets pointed to higher opens for stock markets. Advertisement The economy created 313,000 jobs in February, the most since October 2015. Wages rose 2.6 percent from a year earlier, below the 2.9 percent rate for January that stoked inflation concerns. In theory, as employers add large numbers of new employees, the competition to hire workers should drive wages much higher. Why is that not happening right now? It seems a large number of people who previously weren’t looking for jobs are now entering the work force. That, in part, explains the 800,000 person increase in the labor force. 
            Monster household survey this month: 800k gain in labor force, participation rate and employment-population ratio both up 0.3 percentage points.         But investors will no doubt find something to fret about. Some may decide that the growth in employment is so strong that it won’t be long before wage pressures build up. The amount of slack in the labor force is unknown, so investors shouldn’t rely on it to dampen wage growth indefinitely, according to this view. — Peter Eavis It’s the unknown that torments investors every time the jobs report comes out. Maybe we can shed some light. As Friday’s jobs report showed, the economy is adding large a numbers of jobs without stoking the sort of surge in wages that makes investors worried about inflation. Investors favor these economic conditions because it reduces the chances that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates more quickly than they expect. But how long might wage growth remain moderate? Much depends on how much slack exists in the jobs market. The headline unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, suggests there is very little. But the unemployment rate does not count the people who aren't in the workforce – and who may now enter it. No one knows for sure how many of these people are really looking for a job at any one time, or might do so in the near future. But if there are a lot of them, companies will not struggle to find workers — and wage growth might remain tame. Conversely, if the number of prospective workers on the sideline is small, wage pressures could soon build up. One way to get an idea of the size of this group of people is to look at the employment rate, which measures people with jobs as a percentage of the population (over 16 years old and excluding prisoners.) At 60.4 percent in February, that rate is still well below the level it was at before the 2008 financial crisis. That would imply that there are still a lot of people who could enter the jobs market. Advertisement But our colleague Ben Casselman, who covers economics, has devised an adjusted employment rate that readers might find interesting. How did you adjust the measurement of the employment rate – and why did you make your tweaks? Let me start with the “why?” The employment rate is great in that it avoids all the issues that bedevil the unemployment rate in terms of deciding who should “count” as unemployed. But the problem is that it’s too broad. It includes a huge group of people who no one would expect to work, namely retirees. And that group is growing rapidly because baby boomers are aging. So if we want the employment rate to tell us anything meaningful about the state of the economy, we have to account for that big demographic trend in some way. One easy way to do this is to look at the employment rate among so-called “prime-age” workers, those ages 25 to 54. That excludes both retirees and most college students, which means it filters out a lot of the demographic noise in the employment rate. The problem is, it filters out a lot of valuable information, too. Lots of 55-year-olds work! And indeed, 55-year-olds are much more likely to work now than they were a generation ago. My calculation, which borrows from an approach used by economists (and occasional Upshot contributor) Ernie Tedeschi, adjusts for demographic shifts by controlling for age and sex. It essentially asks, “What would the employment rate look like today if the U.S. population still had the same demographic profile as it did before the recession?” What does your adjusted employment rate tell us about the jobs market right now? By my calculation, the demographics-adjusted employment rate was at 62.8 percent in February, which is almost exactly where it stood in December 2007, which was the first month of the recession. But it’s still significantly below where we were in 2000, the last time the unemployment rate got this low. Can we use your adjusted employment rate to get an idea of how much slack is left in the labor force? Yes, but it doesn’t give a definitive answer. What it tells us is that the employment rate has fully recovered from the recession. It doesn’t necessarily mean that all the slack is gone. Let me expand on that slightly. Between the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the peak of the housing bubble in 2007, the age-adjusted employment rate fell by about a percentage point. There are two reads on that. One is that the job market just never got as good in the mid-2000s as it did in 1999 and 2000. The other interpretation is that there has been a fundamental shift in the economy, and for some set of reasons — technology, globalization, video games — the share of Americans who are willing or able to work has fallen. Advertisement If you buy that second story, then the fact that the age-adjusted employment rate is back to prerecession levels should tell you that we’re basically at full-employment today. The slack is gone. This is as good as it gets. But I would argue the last couple years should lead to significant skepticism about this kind of structural-change thesis. The labor force has grown dramatically over the last few years. Job growth has continued unabated. Unemployment rates for marginalized groups such as black Americans have fallen sharply. And this has all happened in an environment where wage growth has been sluggish, which suggests that employers are able to attract workers without boosting pay, at least by much. All of that suggests that there are still people out there who are willing to work if opportunities become available. I don’t know if we can get back to that 2000 employment level, but today’s report suggests we can at least keep moving in that direction. • Joseph Song and Michelle Meyer, BofA Merrill Lynch: Today’s “Goldilocks” report suggests the business cycle still has another leg to go: the labor supply is increasing to meet the gain aggregate demand, preventing price pressures from building too aggressively. • Ellen Zentner, Morgan Stanley: Straight lines don’t exist in economics. Despite the move lower in the year-over-year pace of average hourly earnings (AHE), the underlying trend in wage growth continues to firm, in line with continued tightening in the labor market and rising productivity. • Joe Brusuelas, RSM US: “The job market continues to sizzle as the economy is in the early stages of absorbing a late cycle fiscal boost that will support a growth rate well above the long-term trend in 2018. The 313,000 job gain is more than triple that necessary to meet the demand of new entrants into the work force, which if it sustained will continue to put downward pressure on the unemployment rate. This will not be lost among an F.O.M.C. that leans hawkish in 2018 and points toward an increasing probability that the central bank will hike rates four times this year. How strong is this labor market? The increase of 806,000 in the labor force and 785,000 in the household employment estimate are robust and statistically significant, which is a rare two-for in the monthly labor report. This labor market is on fire and wage gains are in train.” • James Ingram, MB Capital: “February’s fall in average wage rise data takes some of the pressure off. But the creation of more than 300,000 jobs in February suggests it will return in the months to come. Throw in a potential trade war between the US and the EU and the US economy could be headed for a perfect inflationary storm later this year. An interest rate hike in March from the US Fed must now be all but nailed on.” Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . • Capital Economics: “We suspected that the flu epidemic and the unseasonably cold weather in January had depressed payrolls, but even we were caught out by the strength. Illness and weather also affected the earnings and hours worked data in January, with those effects unwinding in February.” Specifically, Ms. Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, is interested in the loans Apollo and Citigroup extended to Jared Kushner’s family real estate firm, reports Politico’s Playbook. Ms. Warren, along with Representative Elijah Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, Senator Tom Carper, Democrat of Delaware, and Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, sent letters to Apollo (the letter) and Citigroup (the letter) asking: “For the dates the loans were offered, conditions of the loan and a description of the process by which the Kushner Companies got the loans. It asks for ALL MEETINGS between the two firms and Kushner, and various details about those meetings. They request ALL DOCUMENTS from the loan process and whether any of the loans included foreign financing.” Context The New York Times reported last week that:  • Josh Harris, a founder of Apollo Global Management, was advising Trump administration on infrastructure policy last year and met with Mr. Kushner several times. Among other things, the two men discussed a possible White House job for Mr. Harris, which never materialized. In November, Apollo lent $184 million to Kushner Companies. The loan was to refinance the mortgage on a Chicago skyscraper Advertisement • Michael Corbat, Citigroup’s C.E.O., met with Mr. Kushner in the spring, and shortly afterward the bank lent Kushner Companies $325 million. Stephanie Clifford of the NYT reported: Martin Shkreli, a former pharmaceutical executive notorious for sharply increasing drug prices, mounting sneering defenses of his actions and even issuing a bounty for one of Hillary Clinton’s hairs, was sentenced on Friday to seven years in prison after being convicted of fraud last year. Last summer, a jury convicted Mr. Shkreli, nicknamed Pharma Bro, on three of eight counts , concluding that he had lied to investors about, among other things, how the hedge funds were managed, what they invested in and how much money they had. The jury found that he had also secretly controlled a huge number of Retrophin shares. Prosecutors had sought a sentence of at least 15 years; the defense had pushed for 12 to 18 months. Ben Sisario of the NYT writes: When Martin Shkreli, the disgraced former pharmaceuticals executive, is sentenced for securities fraud in Brooklyn on Friday, the government will have its pick of a number of his assets to satisfy the $7.36 million judgmentagainst him. There is a brokerage account with $5 million in cash, shares in his company Vyera Pharmaceuticals, even a Picasso. And then there is an item that has been the subject of worldwide intrigue: the sole copy of the Wu-Tang Clan album “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin,”packaged in a custom silver-and-nickel case and accompanied by a 174-page leather-bound book. It may be the most famous album ever kept in the possession of just one person. But what is it worth? The answer? It is complicated, though experts all doubt that the album could yield anywhere near the $2 million Mr. Shkreli apparently paid for the album at auction three years ago. President Trump authorized tariffs on imported steel and aluminum yesterday, defying allies and Republicans alike. But as Peter Eavis notes, the presence of exemptions for Canada and Mexico show more wiggle room than expected: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has leeway to exempt certain steel and aluminum imports from the restrictions if he determines that the United States lacks the capacity to produce them. There is also a national security exemption, notable since national security concerns are the legal basis for the tariffs. And Neil Irwin of the Upshot reckons that while we’re seeing a trade skirmish, it won’t necessarily become a trade war. (He also thinks it’s partly a negotiating tactic in the Nafta talks.) That hasn’t stopped trade partners  protesting. And in its lead editorial, The Economist wrote, “Not since its inception at the end of the second world war has the global trading system faced such danger.” The other China trade story: Mr. Trump tweeted that he has asked Beijing to reduce its trade deficit with the U.S. by $1 billion, adding, “We must act soon!” Elon Musk subsequently beseeched him on Twitter to tackle China’s restrictions on auto imports.

Advertisement More from Jonathan Swan of Axios: Trump loves Navarro, and Navarro reflects the president’s hard-wired beliefs on trade far more closely than Cohn ever did, or did any of the other top officials involved in the trade debate besides Wilbur Ross. Mr. Navarro isn’t in the lead — other candidates include a top lieutenant to Mr. Cohn, Shahira Knight — but can’t be counted out.

(Politico) Behind Cigna’s $67 billion (with debt) acquisition of Express Scripts is the idea that health insurance on its own is a challenged business. The C.E.O.s of the two companies said the union would help lower costs. But it’s also meant to help Cigna counter both UnitedHealth, the giant of the industry, and a combined CVS and Aetna. There’s skepticism: Cigna’s shares fell 11 percent yesterday. Matthew Borsch of BMO Capital Markets said that investors had hoped the insurer would buy something other than a business “under pressure, under scrutiny and to some degree in decline.” About that pressure: The F.D.A. has shown interest in lack of competition among drug benefits managers. David Balto, an antitrust expert, told the NYT, “History has shown where there are multiple mergers going on in a single industry, the Justice Department goes on high alert.” Advertisement Critics’ corner: Charley Grant of Heard on the Street writes, “Cigna has increased its vulnerability to industry changes rather than reduced it.” And Lex says of Express Scripts’ industry, “Like Seth Rogen comedies, they are a U.S. institution whose utility eludes other nations.” The deals flyaround • Toys “R” Us, yet to find a buyer, is preparing to liquidate its U.S. operations, unnamed sources say.

(NYT) The former president is in talks to create exclusive content for the streaming giant, though they haven’t figured out how many episodes to do, according to the NYT. He’s also drawn interest from Apple and Amazon. Our questions: • How much would Netflix pay? Remember that it gave the showrunner Ryan Murphy $300 million for a five-year content deal. The Obamas already signed book deals reportedly worth $60 million. • While Mr. Obama doesn’t intend to take on his successor directly, will his likely choice of topics — like health care, immigration, voting rights — be seen as a counter to President Trump anyway? Elsewhere in media: The actor and producer Michael B. Jordan will adopt the use of “inclusion riders” in his production company’s projects. Disney will add a live-action “Star Wars” series to its forthcoming streaming service, to be directed by Jon Favreau. And Disney shareholders voted down a nonbinding endorsement of Bob Iger’s pay package. While the now nine-year-old bull market may still have some legs — even if it isn’t likely to top last year’s performance — there’s more for investors be anxious of. Not so for traders.

You might need a hug. And Peter Eavis wonders: What happens when the bond market and the Fed disagree? It’s a bit like seeing the economy’s parents fight, he says.
