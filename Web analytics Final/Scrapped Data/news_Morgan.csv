 FRANKFURT —  French energy group Engie is considering selling its power plant assets in Germany in a deal that could fetch a few hundred million euros, two people familiar with the process told Reuters. Engie owns or holds stakes in three hard coal-fired power plants in Germany. It is the sole owner of the 472 megawatt (MW) Zolling site near Munich and the 351 MW Farge plant, and has a 52 percent stake in the 731 MW site in Wilhelmshaven. One of the people said Engie had hired JP Morgan to advise on selling the assets, which could also include its local retail business. The source said the sale could also cover Engie's 800 MW Centrale Rotterdam plant in the Netherlands. Engie's Wilhelmshaven plant in Germany is one of the most modern in Europe, with an efficiency level of 46 percent. Switzerland's BKW Energie AG has a 33 percent stake and municipal utility WSW Energie & Wasser AG owns 15 percent. Advertisement In addition to coal-fired capacity, Engie's Zolling plant has two 25 MW gas turbines that can be switched on in times of high demand or undersupply to balance out demand swings. Engie also operates a 20 MW biomass plant there.  . Possible buyers for the assets could include Czech energy group EPH and German utility RWE, which have both snapped up conventional power plants in the past or have announced plans to do so, the people said. Advertisement Engie, EPH, JP Morgan and RWE all declined to comment. Engie, Europe's fourth-largest utility by market value, has long been reducing exposure to coal, reinvesting proceeds from sales of fossil-fuel assets in renewables and grids as the sector shifts away from conventional power source. Sources said this week the group was looking at big acquisitions that would generate cash, in a strategy switch following the sale of 15 billion euros (13.42 billion pounds)of assets that have shrunk its earnings base.

 WASHINGTON —  Two of Wall Street's largest Washington-based trade groups said on Tuesday that they were merging, as big banks rethink their lobbying strategies under the business-friendly administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. The Clearing House Association (TCH) and the Financial Services Roundtable (FSR), which both count the likes of Citigroup, Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase among their members, will combine to form a single group to push policy changes in the nation's capital, they said in a joint statement. Greg Baer, TCH's president, will serve as CEO of the new group, which has yet to be named. FSR announced in February that its chief, former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, would leave the organization this month. The merger combines TCH's focus on research and regulatory issues with the FSR's experience in lobbying lawmakers, said one person familiar with the deal. Advertisement A payments company run by TCH to process transactions across the banking system will remain a separate entity after the merger, which should be completed within 60 days. Advertisement Big banks, long-reviled in Washington, have been beefing up and refocusing their external and internal lobbying operations in a bid to capitalize upon Trump's pledge to relax financial rules introduced following the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Wells Fargo announced several new hires to its government relations team in January, including a new head of public policy, Beth Zorc, who previously had been acting general counsel at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  . In July, JP Morgan Chase named Tim Berry as its new head of government relations. Berry had previously worked as chief of staff for House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and as an executive at the media outlet Axios. Commercial banks spent a record $66.6 million on lobbying in 2017, according to the political contributions database OpenSecrets. ""Everyone's really concentrating their power and their turf,"" said Paul Merski, an executive vice president at the Independent Community Bankers of America, which represents small banks. While big banks are hoping regulators picked by Trump will eventually ease rules imposed on them, they have yet to score any major victories, despite over a year with Trump in the White House and Republicans running Congress.

 MILAN/ROME —  Italy's Atlantia and Spanish builder ACS agreed a joint 18 billion euro (£15.9 billion) bid for Abertis on Wednesday, ending a five-month battle for the Spanish road-toll operator and easing political worries. The Spanish government had been concerned that an Italian victory could leave some of the country's most important roads under full foreign control and the proposed joint bid, which will be made by ACS-controlled Hochtief, ensures a strong Spanish influence over the future of Abertis. Under the terms of the proposed deal Atlantia will own 50 percent plus one share in the entity which will ultimately own Abertis, plus an additional, indirect stake through a related purchase of around 25 percent interest in Hochtief. Atlantia will consolidate Abertis in its balance sheet. The Italian company will also have the option to buy from Abertis a stake of between 29.9 and 34 percent in Spanish telecom masts group Cellnex, at a price between 21.2 and 21.5 euros per share, Atlantia said late on Wednesday. Advertisement ACS's and Atlantia's boards approved the agreement and the top executives will hold a joint press conference on Thursday. Advertisement ""This is a cooperative approach that solves many issues,"" one source close to the negotiations told Reuters. Although the deal falls short of Atlantia's initial ambitions of exercising full control over the world's biggest transport-infrastructure group, the Rome-based company will still expand in Europe, in Latin America and enters new markets. ""We are excited by the opportunity to work with ACS in Abertis... and at the prospect of creating a global platform from which to enter countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia and Germany,"" Atlantia CEO Giovanni Castellucci said. It is the first foray by ACS and Hochteif into motorway concessions and they will also benefit from a strong financial partner in Abertis.  . Florentino Perez, ACS's major investor and Real Madrid soccer club chairman, and the Benetton family, which controls Atlantia, had been wrangling over Abertis since October. Perez and Castellucci led the talks to find a way out of the costly and risky bidding war, with a deal finally signed late on Tuesday in Madrid, the source said. A group of banks including Credit Suisse, BNP Paribas, JP Morgan and Italy's UniCredit have arranged a 14 billion euros financing package for the deal, two other sources said. Atlantia and ACS said in separate statements that Hochtief would first launch an 18.2 billion euro cash bid for Abertis, before transferring it to a vehicle which will be 30 percent owned by ACS and almost 20 percent by Hochtief. Advertisement A shareholders pact and a long-term contract among the three groups will set governance rules. Another source said the acquisition of Abertis would be done first through Hochtief to avoid loading ACS with too much debt. Some newspapers have speculated that Atlantia and ACS could choose to break up the Abertis business in the future, but the statements on Wednesday made no mention of this possibility. Lazard and JP Morgan advised ACS and Hochtief on the deal while Credit Suisse, Mediobanca and Santander worked for Atlantia.

14-Mar,"Advertisement Supported by By Reuters LONDON — One of the biggest bitcoin exchanges has struck a rare deal which will allow it to open a bank account with Britain's Barclays, making it easier for UK customers of the exchange to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, the UK boss of the exchange said on Wednesday. Large global banks have been reluctant to do business with companies that handle bitcoin and other digital coins because of concerns they are used by criminals to launder money and that regulators will soon crack down on them. San Francisco-based exchange, Coinbase, said its UK subsidiary was the first to be granted an e-money license by the UK's financial watchdog, a precursor to getting the banking relationship with Barclays. The Barclays account will make it easier for British customers. Previously, they had to transfer pounds into euros and go through an Estonian bank.  ""Having domestic GBP payments with Barclays reduces the cost, improves the customer experience...and makes the transaction faster,"" said Zeeshan Feroz, Coinbase's UK CEO. The UK is the largest market for Coinbase in Europe, and the exchange said its customer base in the region was growing at twice the rate of elsewhere. Feroz said that it took considerable time to get a UK bank on board, partly because Barclays needed to be sure that Coinbase had the right systems in place to prevent money laundering. Regulators across the globe have warned that cryptocurrencies are used by criminals to launder money, and some exchanges have been shut down.  ""It's a completely brand new industry. There's a lot of understanding and risk management that's needed,"" Feroz said. Despite growing interest in both digital currencies and the technology behind them, some big lenders have limited their customers ability to buy cryptocurrencies, fearing a plunge in their value will leave customers unable to repay debts.  In February, British banks Lloyds and Virgin Money said they would ban credit card customers from buying cryptocurrencies, following the lead of JP Morgan and Citigroup.  Coinbase said it had also become the first crypto exchange to use Britain's Faster Payments Scheme, a network used by the traditional financial industry.

 LONDON (LPC) - The price of Steinhoff International's loans is falling in the secondary loan market as banks continue to sell to hedge funds ahead of an anticipated waiver request on the troubled South African retailer's €10.7 billion (9.53 billion pounds)debt, banking sources said. The price of Steinhoff's debt has fallen to around 65% of face value from around 73% in early February as concern remains around the company's debt position, loan traders said.   ""Certainly with the price dropping to the mid 60s, people are getting more nervous about it,"" a senior loan trader said. Steinhoff is fighting for survival after discovering accounting irregularities in December that triggered an 85% share price slide in the group and a raft of changes in its boardroom and leadership. Advertisement The company asked convertible bond holders for a waiver in February to help ease its liquidity position, while auditor PwC assesses the scale of Steinhoff's accounting problem. Advertisement The company is expected to fold the bond waiver request into a larger waiver across all of its company's debt instruments which would be effective until June, several sources said. Steinhoff has not yet asked for the waiver, which could be complicated by the loan sales to distressed investors, as it would need to be agreed consensually by all of Steinhoff's debt holders, bankers said. “The waiver is difficult to ask for. I don’t know if it will get done. It is a tough one – there are a lot of creditors to bring in. It could just become too difficult to do,” a creditor said. Steinhoff declined to comment. If Steinhoff seeks a waiver as expected, creditors are expected to make several requests in return. Lenders want reassurances from Steinhoff that it has a contingency plan in place to deal with the €1.9bn equivalent of debt which matures this year.  Convertible bondholders are also expected to ask that Steinhoff's money or assets are not moved from South Africa to Europe to avoid diluting their guarantees.      HEAVY TRADING Loan traders estimate that more than €1 billion equivalent of Steinhoff's loans have traded recently in euros and dollars, with around €400 million-€500 million trading in the last couple of weeks. Some lenders have sold as much as €200 million each.  Advertisement ""North of €1 billion has traded in the last few weeks and the biggest tickets are €200m,"" the senior loan trader said.  . Concern is mounting as the South African company's woes start to affect its 40 plus multinational retail operations, which include Britain's Poundland. Steinhoff said on February 28 that its working capital 'dried up' in the first quarter. ""Each individual company seems to be struggling now as well. Before it was a South African issue,"" the senior loan trader said. Debt in all of Steinhoff's loans has been trading - including B1, B2 and B3 term loans, a euro-denominated revolving credit and Schuldschein loans. Pricing across the tranches is moving into line with the euro revolving credit, which was priced at 65.67 on March 7, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. Natixis exited its $110 million-equivalent exposure in February and JP Morgan also sold a block in early February at around 73% of face value. Hedge funds, including Silver Point Capital, Centerbridge Partners and Davidson Kempner Capital Management, have bought hundreds of millions of euros of Steinhoff’s debt, loan traders said. Taconic Capital, Blackstone, Centerbridge and SVP bought debt in February. Many early buyers have lost money, however, as the value of Steinhoff's loans has continued to fall.   ""A few people have been burned who bought high and are now selling out and taking a bit of a loss,"" the senior loan trader said. Advertisement Banks including BNP Paribas, HSBC and Nomura have announced provisions on loans that were attributed to Steinhoff. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citibank, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan all took hits in the fourth quarter related to Steinhoff, IFR reported.

 LONDON —  A takeover offer for NEX Group sent its shares shooting up by almost a third on Friday, while the FTSE 100 registered a weekly decline in spite of a boost from energy and financials stocks. Financial technology company NEX Group rose 31 percent after saying it received a preliminary takeover offer from CME. Speculation that the offer could trigger a bidding war is likely to support the shares. ""NEX is an important strategic asset and therefore we would not be surprised to see competing interest,"" said Liberum. The FTSE 100 rose 0.3 percent on Friday, leaving it 0.7 percent down on the week. ""The next stage for UK equities does look a little bit more mired, and no matter what happens to the pound, UK stocks could warrant a risk premium as we head into the final (Brexit) negotiations,"" said Gautam Batra, head of investments at Mediolanum Asset Management. Advertisement The FTSE was buoyed by strong financials and energy stocks, but several companies suffered big share price falls after results. Advertisement Berkeley Group was the biggest FTSE 100 faller, retreating by 5.2 percent after the house builder said that planning constraints meant it could not increase volumes further. ""The shares are looking fairly expensive and standing at the highest premium to fair value in the sector,"" said Shore Capital analyst Robin Hardy. ""We would, at the very least, still look to be taking profit here and, as with the other larger-cap house builders, reduce weightings.""  . Berkeley's rivals Taylor Wimpey, Barratt Development and Persimmon fell by between 1.3 percent and 1.8 percent. Outsourcing company Mitie fell 3 percent after saying it expects a tough year ahead, increasing its estimated costs from a turnaround plan. M&A news also moved Old Mutual.

Shares in pubs group J D Wetherspoon finished 6.3 percent down after the company said it expects lower sales growth and higher costs in the rest of the year. TalkTalk fell 2.2 percent after JP Morgan cut its target price on the stock.

 NEW YORK (LPC) - A dozen banks that signed on to provide a record US$100bn bridge loan to back Broadcom Ltd's planned US$117bn takeover of Qualcomm Inc will earn starkly less than planned for extending credit to the chipmaker after US President Donald Trump on Monday blocked the deal over national security concerns. Broadcom in February detailed the jumbo loan, the biggest committed credit package since global brewer AB InBev's US$75bn loan in 2015 that backed its purchase of rival SABMiller, for what would be the technology sector's largest deal ever. The loans represented a huge windfall for bankers eager to put money to work and rake in related fees. ""Broadcom’s 12 bridge lenders now stand to split a total pool of just US$20m to US$40m in fees,"" said Jeff Nassof, a director at Freeman Consulting Services. ""Had the transaction closed, fees for the proposed long-term debt financing package could have reached 10 times this amount."" The whittled down fees that will be earned include money paid upfront and ticking fees accrued from the time the loan opened, he said. The lost fees include those that would have been taken in by underwriting roughly US$31bn in permanent bond financing that the company said it would issue to reduce the bridge. Advertisement The original 12 banks were in the process of downsizing their risk by expanding the bank group when the White House announced it was blocking the bid. Advertisement RECORD LOAN THAT WASN'T The bank financing package included a US$20bn, one-year cash flow bridge facility; a US$4.477bn, two-year term loan; a US$19.679bn, three-year term loan; a US$19.679bn, five-year term loan; and a US$5bn, five-year revolving credit facility, LPC previously reported. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Mizuho, SMBC, MUFG, Wells Fargo, Scotiabank, BMO Capital Markets, Royal Bank of Canada and Morgan Stanley were lead arrangers and joint bookrunners on the syndicated loan. The banks were either unavailable to immediately comment, or declined to comment. Silver Lake, KKR and CVC had also agreed to provide US$6bn of convertible bond financing to Broadcom. With this milestone loan going away, based on administration worries that the merger would give China an upper hand in mobile communications, bankers will have plenty of lending capacity to apply to other situations. The decision to scuttle the deal was based on concerns that the US advantage would be lost to China if Singapore-based Broadcom took over San Diego-based Qualcomm, according to a White House official. ""There is no issue with capacity in the market, full stop,” said a banker not involved in the deal. “Banks are looking to do business. People would be disappointed with this going away.""  . Initial margins are 100bp over Libor on the cash flow bridge, 112.5bp on the two-year term loan, 125bp on the three-year term loan and revolver, and 137.5bp on the five-year term loan, Thomson Reuters LPC previously reported. The revolver pays an initial commitment fee of 12.5bp. In syndicated loans for investment grade credits, a portion of the bridge fees is usually paid at the announcement of the deal. The other portion is paid at 90 days. The first dozen banks only got to cash in on the first part. “If you get an executive order that the deal is not going to happen the [loan] deal goes away,” the banker said. Advertisement Qualcomm, which has emerged as one of the biggest competitors to China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd in the sector, making it a prized asset, has consistently rebuffed Broadcom's acquisition efforts. Broadcom said in a statement that it was reviewing the presidential order and ""strongly disagrees that its proposed acquisition of Qualcomm raises any national security concerns."" Potential benefactors of the freed up lending capacity generated by the failed Broadcom takeover include US health insurer Cigna Corp, which is supporting its roughly US$52bn acquisition of pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co with a US$26.7bn 364-day senior unsecured bridge loan facility. The company, in announcing its merger last Thursday, had said it had obtained committed debt financing from Morgan Stanley and MUFG.

 PARIS —  Societe Generale shares fell on Thursday after the French bank announced the unexpected departure of deputy chief executive Didier Valet. SocGen shares were down 2.4 percent in early session trading, making them the worst performer on Paris' benchmark CAC-40 index and one of the worst on the pan-European STOXX 600 index. The STOXX Europe 600 banks index was up 0.4 percent. Late on Wednesday, SocGen said Valet - its deputy CEO who was also in charge of its investment banking activities - was leaving ""‍following a divergence of approaches regarding management of a specific legal matter"". SocGen did not give any more details in its statement about the legal matter and said Valet resigned in order to preserve the bank's ""general interests"". Advertisement The ""divergence of approaches"" related to investigations over the suspected rigging of the London interbank offered rate (Libor), an interest rate used in contracts worth trillions of dollars globally, a source familiar with the matter said. Advertisement ""This announcement comes as a negative surprise as Didier Valet was well regarded and the market did not expect top management changes on litigation cases that should be adequately provisioned,"" wrote JP Morgan analysts, who kept a ""neutral"" rating on SocGen shares. That view was echoed by analysts at investment banks Jefferies and Kepler Cheuvreux. Jefferies kept a ""buy"" rating on SocGen shares but Kepler took a slightly more negative view, with a ""hold"" rating. ""Following the totally unexpected departure of deputy CEO Didier Valet due to a 'divergence of approach regarding the management of a specific legal matter', Societe Generale is left once again in the throes of another crisis,"" Kepler analysts wrote.  . ""We maintain our 'Hold' rating, but we believe this departure could be the one problem too many for SocGen, which we believe is now at play."" SocGen is one of several banks to be caught up in investigations into the rigging of Libor around the time of the global financial crisis. U.S. authorities charged two former SocGen managers last August with taking part in a scheme to manipulate the global U.S. dollar Libor benchmark. ""It's the biggest thing to happen in the group since the departure of Jean-Pierre Mustier,"" an insider said of Valet's departure. Mustier, head of the investment bank at the time of the Jerome Kerviel trading scandal, quit in 2008. He is currently CEO of Italy's UniCredit. Valet, a close and long-time ally of chief executive Frederic Oudea, started his career at SocGen in 2000. He was chief financial officer from 2008 to 2012 and had been head of investment banking activities since 2012. Under Valet, the bank has worked on making investment bank revenue less volatile by increasing the share of fixed income activities versus equities.

 PARIS —  France's AXA moved to buy Bermuda-based XL Group for $15.3 billion on Monday to create what it said would be a world leader in property and casualty insurance. Europe's second-biggest insurer offered $57.60 for each XL share, a 33 percent premium to Friday's closing price, and said buying XL would result in property and casualty insurance rising to half of AXA's earnings, from 39 percent. XL has already agreed to AXA's offer, and AXA, which ranks as Europe's second-biggest insurer in terms of market capitalization behind Germany's Allianz, will look to de-list XL's shares. AXA said it would finance the deal with debt, cash and the proceeds of the IPO of its U.S. business. Insurers are turning to takeovers to strengthen their businesses as they face tougher regulation and falling returns from financial market investments. AXA's deal comes just over a month after American International Group said it would buy reinsurer Validus for around $5.6 billion. Advertisement P&C insurers' stocks fell during last year's natural disaster season and have attracted the attention of bidders as premiums are rising after several years of falling rates. Advertisement Allianz had also been seen as a possible suitor for XL, but a source close to the German company said Allianz was not overly concerned by AXA scooping up XL. AXA's shares fell 6.9 percent to 23.33 euros by 0955 GMT, as some analysts said the deal looked pricey.    Chief Executive Thomas Buberl said the deal will enable AXA to dominate the global property and casualty market, and reduce its exposure to the volatility of financial markets. ""We will be number one in commercial insurance,"" Buberl told a news conference in Paris. Some analysts were skeptical about the price. ""In our view, the acquisition of XL fits AXA's strategy of growing in commercial insurance. However, the purchase price looks quite high even after synergy effects and AXA's debt ratio is again rather stretched,"" said analysts at German brokerage Bankhaus Lampe, who kept a ""hold"" rating on AXA shares. Analysts at UBS said XL did not necessarily fit AXA's plans to grow in Asia, given XL's predominantly U.S.-exposed business.  . ""AXA targets growth in health, protection and commercial lines, P&C (property & casualty) markets preferably in Asia rather than U.S. reinsurance,"" UBS said. ""However, acquiring XL does give global commercial P&C lines exposure and further accelerate AXA's exit from more volatile business lines in the U.S.,"" it added. COST SYNERGIES AXA has not been hit as hard as some by a series of costly natural catastrophes in 2017, thanks to reinsurance contracts and a diversified business model, and last month it reported higher-than-expected 2017 net profits of 6.2 billion euros. Advertisement The company expects the XL takeover to be cash accretive, and result in cost synergies of around $400 million per year, based on pre-tax earnings. Jerome Schupp, fund manager at Geneva-based Prime Partners which owns AXA shares, said it was a ""good deal"" given AXA's plans to cut its exposure to financial markets, and that it looked positive on a long-term view. The French company also reaffirmed its 2020 financial targets, under which AXA aims to increase earnings per share by 3 to 7 percent a year over the 2016-2020 period. Law firm Skadden said it was advising XL over the AXA takeover, while AXA added that JP Morgan was involved in part of the financing of the XL takeover.

 (Reuters) - GKN has struck a $6.1 billion (4.4 billion pounds) deal to merge its automotive business with U.S. company Dana Incorporated in a move by the British engineer to fend off a hostile takeover by turnaround specialist Melrose Industries. FTSE 100-listed GKN said on Friday that it had agreed to combine its Driveline division with the Ohio-based maker of axles and driveshafts in a deal that gives GKN shareholders a 47.25 percent stake in the enlarged, U.S.-listed group. The British company, customers of which include Fiat Chrysler and Volkswagen, will also receive $1.6 billion in cash while $1 billion of GKN's pension deficit will be transferred to the combined business. It deals a blow to FTSE 250 group Melrose, which has been pursuing GKN since January, when the engineering group spurned its unsolicited cash-and-shares bid that at the time valued GKN at 7.4 billion pounds ($10.2 billion). Advertisement Melrose responded by turning hostile and taking its offer directly to GKN's shareholders, putting pressure on the engineer's newly appointed chief executive, Anne Stevens. Advertisement The deal with Dana could now force Melrose to raise its bid. By 1300 GMT on Friday, which was the first closing date of its offer, Melrose had received acceptances from investors holding only 5.76 percent of GKN stock, the turnaround specialist said. It added that it was extending the offer until March 29. GKN shares advanced 3.3 percent to close at 435.1 pence in London. That is higher than the level of Melrose's offer, which currently values GKN at about 414.8 pence per share based on the Melrose share price, which was up 4 percent at 224.7 pence. Dana shares climbed 4.1 percent to $27.27. IMPROVED OFFER? ""We might need to revisit our offer, I think that's what the market is telling us,"" a source close to Melrose said. According to UK rules, Melrose has until March 19 to improve its bid. But because the Easter break truncates the timetable it effectively has until March 15 to sweeten its offer terms. The deal with Dana ""provides significantly greater value for GKN's shareholders than the Melrose offer"", GKN said. It added that the merger gives Driveline an enterprise value, which includes debt, of $6.1 billion, based on Dana's closing share price of $26.20 on Thursday. The tie-up is expected to deliver annual cost savings and other benefits worth $235 million within three years, it said. Together with GKN's plan to sell its powder metallurgy business, the deal will leave the company focused on aerospace, supplying parts for aircraft including the Black Hawk military helicopter and Eurofighter Typhoon.  . GKN was left vulnerable to bid approaches after two profit warnings in October and November that were caused by problems at its U.S. aerospace business and sent its share price tumbling. Advertisement Dana approached GKN late in 2017 and the pair began talks early this year, the British company disclosed on Friday. Its aerospace division has also attracted a number of suitors since January, but the GKN board decided their proposals undervalued the business and did not pursue them, the company added. SHAREHOLDER CHOICE If the Driveline deal is successful Dana will become a UK domiciled company, though it will remain headquartered in Ohio and its shares will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange. It will also be led by James Kamsickas, Dana's current CEO. GKN shareholders will need to approve the merger, which means they will have to weigh its merits against a Melrose deal. That will include considering whether they want to hold a stake in New York-listed Dana or London-listed Melrose. ""Following the (Dana) transaction, GKN shareholders will own 47 percent of a $14 billion revenue global automotive group and will retain ownership of GKN's outstanding remaining businesses,"" said GKN Chairman Mike Turner. However, Melrose argued that many GKN investors would neither wish nor be able to hold U.S. stock. ""A hasty sale of one of Britain’s most important businesses will leave it listed overseas, run by a foreign management team and rebranded as a U.S. business,"" Melrose Chairman Christopher Miller said. ""In our view it is structured in a way prejudicial to GKN shareholders’ interests."" Separately, the trustees of GKN's group pension said the arrangements agreed as part of the Driveline transaction provide ""appropriate mitigation to the schemes"". Credit Suisse and Barclays are advising Dana, while the U.S. company's board is being advised by PJT Partners. GKN is working with JP Morgan, Gleacher Shacklock and UBS.
