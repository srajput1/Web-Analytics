 It has been seven years since the Securities and Exchange Commission first advised public companies to tell investors if they had suffered a cyberattack deemed to be material. But even with the rising number of severe hacks, only a few companies report incidents each year to the S.E.C. Now the S.E.C. has issued updated cybersecurity guidance. Again, it warned public companies to make “timely” disclosure, recognizing the “grave threat” that cybercrime poses to investors and the capital markets. Yet, the S.E.C.’s new guidance doesn’t confront the practical quandary facing public companies victimized by a cyberattack: Going public with news of a cyberattack isn’t always an easy call. Doing so can risk tipping off the bad guys and imperil investigations. Law enforcement often encourages, or even demands, that the incident not be disclosed. At the same time, companies know they have a duty to their investors to provide prompt information about any real risks to their businesses. This tension between the need for discreet cooperation with law enforcement and the obligation to inform investors and the markets creates a dilemma for public companies. Unfortunately, the commission’s updated guidance provides little direction to corporate leaders confronting these conflicting demands. While the guidance acknowledges that it will often take time to “discern the implications” of a breach and that it “may be necessary to cooperate” with law enforcement, it concludes that an active investigation would not “on its own” be a reason to avoid disclosure of a material cybersecurity incident. Advertisement Perhaps this dilemma explains why so few public companies report breaches. In 2017, only 24 companies reported breaches to the S.E.C., according to Audit Analytics, a firm that tracks securities law filings. Since 2011, when the S.E.C. issued its initial cyber guidance, only 106 companies have reported incidents to the S.E.C. Advertisement But during that same period, there were 4,732 cyberattacks on American businesses, researchers for the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse found. While a proportion of those were private companies, it’s unlikely that public companies suffered only 106 breaches that were material in that time.  . The S.E.C. has investigated tardy data breach disclosures but has yet to bring an enforcement action against a company that failed to disclose an incident. The agency is investigating Yahoo’s two data breaches in 2013 and 2014, which the company did not disclose until 2016 even though information on three billion users was compromised. Equifax, too, has acknowledged that the S.E.C. is looking into the theft of Social Security numbers, license numbers, addresses and dates of birth for nearly 145.5 million Americans. The breach was detected in July but not disclosed to the S.E.C. and investors until September. Where does that leave public companies that have been hacked? The solution is not simple. Some say the S.E.C. should adopt a regulation giving companies a “pass” from public disclosure obligations if they refer the matter to law enforcement. But such a rule could easily be abused by corporations that have a big incentive to hush up attacks. They could easily make a halfhearted referral to law enforcement and then use it as a smoke screen to avoid a potentially devastating disclosure. Even companies trying to do the right thing are stuck. They might report an attack to law enforcement, and then hear nothing for weeks or months, in part because there is not enough staff to investigate all of these hacks. At some point, a company will have to conclude that its duty to investors overrides its responsibility as a good corporate citizen to comply with requests for discretion. Even when a breach is disclosed, it’s difficult for companies to support the needs of law enforcement. Companies face irate money managers and investment advisers, who are duty-bound to ask tough questions about their investments. Without getting straight and candid answers to those tough questions, they lose the ability to monitor their investments and, indeed, risk watching their investments lose critical value without visibility into what actually happened. Perhaps this conflict is fundamentally irreconcilable. But with stakes so important given the increasingly sophisticated threats posed by cybercrime to corporate America, we should view the S.E.C.’s new guidance as a starting point and collective opportunity to figure this out.

MARCH 5, 2018
 Agatha Christie’s fictional sleuth Miss Marple once said in a BBC adaptation that “good advice is almost certain to be ignored, but that’s no reason for not giving it.” That may reflect how companies will respond to guidance recently issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission about how companies should deal with cybersecurity threats. Security breaches at companies like Equifax, Target and Yahoo over the past few years have exposed the personal information of millions of consumers. The federal government isn’t immune to hackers, either. The systems of the Office of Personnel Management and even the S.E.C. have been breached. The response from companies usually seems to be about keeping a lid on the hack. That’s something the S.E.C. would like to end, but its guidance may not go very far in changing how companies deal with cybersecurity issues. The S.E.C.’s guidance is full of good advice. The regulator tells companies that they need to have in place “disclosure controls and procedures that provide an appropriate method of discerning the impact that such matters may have on the company and its business, financial condition and results of operations.” Just as important, companies are expected “to disclose cybersecurity risks and incidents that are material to investors, including the concomitant financial, legal or reputational consequences.” Advertisement Those are worthwhile reminders, but the S.E.C. has yet to institute any direct measures to compel companies to reveal the nature and scope of a cybersecurity breach. Advertisement The Equifax breach, which affected more than 140 million people, came to the company’s attention in late July, but the public didn’t learn of it until early September. Whether keeping quiet for almost six weeks can be considered timely disclosure is an open question, but nothing happened to the company because of the delay. There will always be at least some lag time between discovering a theft of information and an assessment of its extent. Hackers don’t want to be discovered, so the scope of a breach may not be immediately apparent. But the S.E.C. pointed out that “an ongoing internal or external investigation — which often can be lengthy — would not on its own provide a basis for avoiding disclosures of a material cybersecurity incident.” The S.E.C. also warns companies about the potential for insider trading when they learn about a breach, which inevitably has a negative effect on the stock price once it is disclosed. It cautioned that “companies would be well served by considering how to avoid the appearance of improper trading during the period following an incident and prior to the dissemination of disclosure.”  . For example, just a few days after the breach at Equifax came to the company’s attention, four members of management, including the chief financial officer, sold $1.8 million worth of shares. An investigation by a special committee of the board of directors exonerated them, finding that none knew about the breach at the time, a key requirement to prove insider trading. The problem is that even the perception that corporate executives sold shares ahead of disclosing a cybersecurity problem can compound the negative publicity surrounding a breach. The S.E.C.’s guidance is certainly welcome, and it may nudge companies to be more aggressive in policing stock sales when a cybersecurity problem comes to light. The problem is that the advice can be easily ignored when a breach occurs. If the S.E.C. wants to send a message to companies, it may need to ratchet up the pressure by pursuing an enforcement action. Nothing gets the attention of corporate directors and executives like a case that describes how a failure to respond in a timely fashion resulted in a violation of disclosure requirements. The problem is that proving a case can be difficult because the standard for when information must be revealed is so elastic. Companies must reveal “material” information in a timely manner, which the Supreme Court said in Basic v. Levinson depended “on the significance the reasonable investor would place on” it. The point at which a cybersecurity breach reaches that level is almost impossible to describe with any precision. And that gives companies flexibility in deciding when the handiwork of hackers becomes material information for investors, despite the S.E.C.’s push for earlier disclosure.

 (Reuters) - Yahoo has been ordered by a federal judge to face much of a lawsuit in the United States claiming that the personal information of all 3 billion users was compromised in a series of data breaches. In a decision on Friday night, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California rejected a bid by Verizon Communications Inc, which bought Yahoo's Internet business last June, to dismiss many claims, including for negligence and breach of contract. Koh dismissed some other claims. She had previously denied Yahoo's bid to dismiss some unfair competition claims. Yahoo was accused of being too slow to disclose three data breaches that occurred from 2013 and 2016, increasing users' risk of identity theft and requiring them to spend money on credit freeze, monitoring and other protection services. Advertisement The breaches were revealed after New York-based Verizon agreed to buy Yahoo's Internet business, and prompted a cut in the purchase price to about $4.5 billion. Advertisement A Verizon spokesman had no immediate comment on Monday. A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The plaintiffs amended their complaint after Yahoo last October revealed that the 2013 breach affected all 3 billion users, tripling its earlier estimate. Koh said the amended complaint highlighted the importance of security in the plaintiffs' decision to use Yahoo.  . ""Plaintiffs' allegations are sufficient to show that they would have behaved differently had defendants disclosed the security weaknesses of the Yahoo Mail System,"" Koh wrote. She also said the plaintiffs could try to show that liability limits in Yahoo's terms of service were ""unconscionable,"" given the allegations that Yahoo knew its security was deficient but did little. In seeking a dismissal, Yahoo said it has long been the target of ""relentless criminal attacks,"" and the plaintiffs' ""20/20 hindsight"" did not cast doubt on its ""unending"" efforts to thwart ""constantly evolving security threats."" Last March, U.S. prosecutors charged two Russian intelligence agents and two hackers in connection with one of the Yahoo breaches. One accused hacker, Karim Baratov, a Canadian born in Kazakhstan, pleaded guilty in November to aggravated identity theft and conspiracy charges. The other defendants remained at large in Russia. The case is In re: Yahoo Inc Customer Data Security Breach Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 16-md-02752.

 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co on Monday named longtime executive James Pitaro the new president of its ESPN sports network, tapping him to navigate a rapid consumer shift from traditional television to online viewing. Pitaro, 48, joined Disney in 2010 and has run the consumer products and interactive group for the past two years. He replaces John Skipper, who resigned in December, citing substance addiction. ESPN, Disney's most important cable network, remains a major profit source for the media giant but has been losing pay TV subscribers to cord cutting. Disney is trying to capture digital viewers with an upcoming streaming service called ESPN+, a $5-a-month subscription that will offer sports programming that is not shown on ESPN's TV channels. ""Jimmy forged his career at the intersection of technology, sports and media, and his vast experience and keen perspective will be invaluable in taking ESPN into the future,"" Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said in a statement. Advertisement He added that Pitaro's appointment ""comes at a time for great opportunity for ESPN."" Pitaro also will serve as co-chair of Disney Media Networks and will report directly to Iger. Advertisement ""The appetite for quality sports content across platforms has never been greater, and I am looking forward to working with the talented ESPN team as we continue to redefine the future fan experience,"" Pitaro said.  . As head of consumer products, Pitaro ran the licensing of Disney-owned characters such as Mickey Mouse for toys, apparel and other merchandise. The consumer products business merged in 2015 with the interactive unit, which handles licensing for video games and oversees Disney websites. Pitaro joined Disney from Yahoo, where he served as head of media, including the company's sports media properties. A new leader for the consumer products unit will be named later, Disney said. Disney shares rose 0.4 percent to close at $103.41 on the New York Stock Exchange.

 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's favorite ice cream company has kicked up a legal storm over the ""Blizzard."" American Dairy Queen, whose Blizzard has long been one of its most popular products, sued W.B. Mason Co in federal court this week to stop the office supplies distributor from selling bottled spring water also bearing the Blizzard name. Dairy Queen's Blizzard contains soft-serve ice cream that can be blended with fruit, nuts, M&Ms, Oreos and other mix-ins. W.B. Mason has fought back, and on Thursday filed its own federal lawsuit seeking a declaration that it did not infringe any trademark belonging to Dairy Queen, owned since 1998 by Buffett's conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Advertisement The litigation is not Dairy Queen's first over the Blizzard name, and follows its 2010 settlement of a lawsuit involving a Southern California frozen yogurt company, Yogubliz. Advertisement Dairy Queen began using the Blizzard name in 1946, and has five Blizzard trademarks dating back to 1952. Its current Blizzard has been for sale since 1985. W.B. Mason, known for the slogan ""Who But W.B. Mason,"" has since 2010 sold Blizzard water, in sizes from 8 ounces to 5 gallons, and has used the name to sell copy paper as early as 2003. It attracted Dairy Queen's attention last April after submitting trademark applications for Blizzard water. In its March 12 complaint, Dairy Queen said W.B. Mason's conduct threatens ""irreparable injury"" and has caused a ""likelihood of confusion"" because many of Dairy Queen's 4,500 U.S. locations sell bottled water.  . The Edina, Minnesota-based company, which has more than 6,700 locations worldwide, is seeking an injunction against W.B. Mason, plus profits from water sales. W.B. Mason, based in Brockton, Massachusetts, said it has ""no interest"" in creating confusion, and has created none. The companies have had ""a long period of what we call co-existence,"" its lawyer, Jason Kravitz, a partner at Nixon Peabody in Boston, said in an interview. ""There has not been to our knowledge a single instance of any consumer being confused by W.B. Mason's sale and promotion of its spring water."" Dairy Queen does not discuss pending litigation, spokesman Dean Peters said in an email. Buffett sometimes visits Dairy Queen in his Omaha, Nebraska, hometown. Advertisement Known for eating habits that would give some doctors fits, the 87-year-old billionaire told Yahoo Finance in 2016 he usually orders a small sundae for the ice cream and an extra large sundae for the topping, and combines them. The cases are American Dairy Queen Corp v. W.B. Mason Co, U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota, No. 18-00693; and W.B. Mason Co v American Dairy Queen Corp, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 18-10488.

6-Mar,"Advertisement Supported by Square Feet New “hyperscale” data centers from the tech giants, part of a wave of global development, helped lead Prineville to a path of recovery. By Keith Schneider PRINEVILLE, ORE. — A decade ago, when five shuttered sawmills and 20 percent unemployment defined Crook County, Ore., nobody envisioned that the path to recovery would be tied to Facebook and Apple. But on the rimrock summit overlooking this city, the county seat and home to 10,000 residents, Facebook is sinking the footings for the first of two 450,000-square-foot data centers that together will cost $1 billion when completed in 2021. The immense buildings will join the four existing data centers, totaling 1.27 million square feet, that Facebook has built here since 2010 at a cost of $1.1 billion. They are among 11 centers the company has built in the United States and overseas. Nearby, Apple built its own $988 million, 660,000-square-foot data center, which the company will soon expand to one million square feet. It is one of seven built by Apple in the United States. One more is under construction in Iowa, and three others are planned in China, Denmark and Ireland, according to an Apple spokeswoman. The Facebook and Apple projects here are part of a wave of global data center construction and development, a market valued at $88 billion last year, according to Synergy Research Group, a market research firm in Reno, Nev. There’s not much architectural excitement about a data center. But the windowless, big-box buildings form the climate-controlled central nervous system of online commerce and communications. They are as essential to the basic economic infrastructure of the 21st century as iron ore mines and auto assembly plants were to the 20th. What distinguishes them is their size. Prineville’s Facebook and Apple centers are among 386 “hyperscale” data centers around the world, built and operated by the 24 biggest internet and technology companies, including Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, eBay, Microsoft and Yahoo. A study this year by Cisco, the Silicon Valley networking company, projected the number of hyperscale data centers to grow to 628 by 2021. Those centers could command more than half of all data center internet traffic. The United States accounts for more than half of all data center construction, Cisco said, followed by Asia, Western Europe and Latin America. A study in 2017 by CBRE Research found that certain metropolitan regions — Chicago, Detroit, New Jersey, New York, Northern Virginia and Silicon Valley — were the most active areas for data center construction in the United States. Like the big industrial projects of the previous century, the investments that Facebook, Apple and their competitors have made in land, buildings and equipment are considerable, typically more than $1 billion each. The centers consume prodigious amounts of electricity and water, just like factories. Property tax breaks that Oregon and other states use to lure data centers also are comparable. What is different is slim staffing. Facebook employs around 200 people here to manage buildings 1,000 feet long. Inside are aisle after aisle of computer servers networked to receive, store, stream and transmit the flood of digital bytes that steer daily life for more than two billion people. “The market is very big because the demand is huge,” said Rob Johnson, chief executive of Vertiv, a $4 billion global technology company in Columbus, Ohio, that designs, builds and supplies equipment to data centers. “Data centers serve the requirements for all the smartphones, streaming, high-definition video and all the new applications like autonomous vehicles. The technology is driving immense amounts of data and traffic.” Lucrative tax incentives are the rare area of data center development that has come under criticism. Iowa last year awarded Apple $208 million in tax breaks to build a $1.3 billion center in rural Waukee that would employ 50 people. “The big tech companies are getting huge tax breaks to build things they would build anyway,” said Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, a research group in Washington. “The cost to taxpayers is enormous for data centers that create very few permanent jobs.” Oregon’s incentive package allows both companies to avoid property taxes for 15 years, saving Facebook and Apple roughly $45 million each over that period. State law also has a sweetener for cities. Companies receiving the tax break are required to pay employees 150 percent of the median regional wage. Prineville data center workers earn at least $60,000 a year. Prineville counts 400 permanent jobs in the data centers, influencing its small-town culture, filling the municipal treasury and transforming its sagebrush and juniper landscape. Mayor Betty Roppe noted that Facebook and Apple provided Prineville with income from other municipal accounts. For instance, the city receives a 5 percent “franchise” fee on all electricity sales in its jurisdiction. Because Facebook’s and Apple’s centers consume nearly $40 million in electricity annually, total franchise fees last year reached $2.2 million, up from $340,000 in 2010. When the abatements expire midway through the 2020s, the value of Prineville’s taxable property will increase by roughly $2 billion, more than doubling the total from the $1.5 billion in property currently assessed by the city. Revenue is projected to reach $9 million annually, up from $4 million currently. “We were a cowboy and timber town,” said Steve Forrester, Prineville’s city manager and a former sawmill executive. “We went from ‘I got to go feed my cows’ to the most technically advanced companies in the world siting data centers in our little town. It freaked some people out.” Once-struggling Prineville has become a factor in turning central Oregon into a dynamic region of demographic and economic transition. It is becoming a bedroom community for Bend, 36 miles away, where the population has nearly doubled since 2000, making it the sixth-fastest-growing city in the country. The data centers also are changing the region’s electrical market. Avangrid Renewables just opened one of Oregon’s largest solar-generating stations outside Prineville, a $120 million, 56-megawatt plant to supply clean energy to Apple. Crook County authorities say they have entertained inquiries for building four more solar stations of similar size to supply data center needs. In 2009, when Ms. Roppe was a member of the City Council, she convened planning meetings with city executives to save Prineville from sawmill shutdowns and a deep recession. Her economic goals were straightforward: diversifying the economy and seeking companies willing to pay living wages. “Our unadjusted employment was 24 percent,” she said. “So we did whatever we had to do to change that.” When seven lawyers arrived in town to scout land for a company called Vitesse, she learned how competitive Prineville was to data center developers. The city and region fill all basic requirements — available land, ample electricity, access to fresh water, proximity to markets and generous tax breaks. Another advantage was cool summers — Facebook cools its data centers with fresh air. Ms. Roppe and her aides soon were made aware that Vitesse was a disguise for Facebook. The company bought 127 acres near the airport for $2.7 million and publicly revealed itself at a groundbreaking ceremony in January 2010. A year later, Apple’s scouts arrived as agents of a front company called Pillar. “We always were left guessing as to who we were dealing with,” Ms. Roppe said. In 2012, after buying 160 acres for $3.6 million, Apple started construction of its big data center. The presence of two big Silicon Valley companies once unnerved Prineville. Though most data center employees are from Crook County, young people wearing hoodies and driving late-model electric hybrid cars were a new presence in bars and on streets where cowboy hats and pickups once dominated. “There was anxiousness,” Mr. Forrester said. “The mill types were going around saying: ‘We don’t want the Mark Zuckerberg types. They’re going to ruin our town.’” Anxiety about newcomers has been replaced by relief over local business generated by the data centers, and new stress over rising housing costs. Residential and office vacancy rates are under 5 percent. “Facebook and Apple brought a lot to this community,” said Erika Vaughan, the owner of Cougar Cuts barbershop. “They are big, but they support small business.” Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS One subscription.Endless discovery.

 Good Tuesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Memo to Qualcomm: National champions have to deliver. • How companies are planning on spending their tax savings. • Behind President Trump’s extraordinary block of Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm. • Meet Larry Page’s flying taxi start-up. • And what lies ahead for Goldman Sachs’s presumptive heir. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. President Trump has stepped in to protect Qualcomm from Broadcom, a foreign company that wanted to buy the San Diego-based chip maker. Rather than let market forces decide what should happen in the chip industry, the administration intervened because it had concerns about national security. One of the government's main worries, laid out in a March 5 letter, was that Broadcom would reduce Qualcomm’s spending on research and development, causing Qualcomm to lose ground in the race to develop important new technologies like 5G, which is designed to make wireless networks faster and more reliable. Chinese companies may gain an advantage in 5G, for instance. Advertisement Qualcomm does spend a lot on research and development. In its last fiscal year, the company’s $5.5 billion of research and development outlays were equivalent to 25 percent of its revenue. That was up from 21 percent on average in the preceding five years. According to Qualcomm executives, spending on 5G has driven the increase. Advertisement The big question is what Qualcomm does now. Will the company become less efficient under the government’s protection? Will it be tempted to spend less on research and development? If that spending falls markedly as a percentage of revenue, United States taxpayers may have reason to feel taken advantage of. — Peter Eavis The Trump administration seems to have taken a more activist role in mergers and acquisitions than past administrations. On Monday, President Trump blocked Broadcom’s hostile bid for Qualcomm. The move came just over three months after President Trump’s Justice Department drew plenty of attention for suing to block AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner. That’s roughly $200 billion worth of transactions. But the administration’s oppositions to M.&A. activity goes further, especially when it comes Chinese acquirers. Here’s a look at some of the other deals that ran into problems securing approval from the United States government: • In March, Changnong, a unit of Beijing Dabeinong Technology, scrapped plans to buy Waldo Farms after it failed to obtain United States government approval. • In September, the Trump administration blocks China’s Canyon Bridge Capital Partners’ $1.3 billion bid for Lattice Semiconductor over national security concerns. • In November, Cowen Group called off its deal for CEFC China Energy, a Chinese conglomerate with big investments in oil in Central Africa, to take a 20 percent stake in the New York boutique investment bank, blaming delays and “uncertainty” in securing Cfius approval. Advertisement • In January, MoneyGram and Ant Financial, the Chinese electronic payments company, canceled their $1.2 billion deal after failing to win approval from a Washington panel that reviews foreign purchases of American companies. This approach to deals is a reversal from the stance of past administrations on deal making. Writes Matt Levine of Bloomberg Views: If the shareholders would rather take the money and leave the business’s fate to the acquirer, the governmental reaction has traditionally been “ehh, what are ya gonna do, capitalism.” But now, maybe, not so much? With (selectively) reinvigorated antitrust enforcement, reinvigorated CFIUS review, and a president who sure seems happy to block mergers for political or personal-offense reasons, there are just a lot more ways to stop a merger, if that’s what you are looking to do. A decade ago, Bear Stearns was facing a grave liquidity crisis. Its stock had plummeted more than 20 percent in just days. Investors, as well as clients and broker-dealers, had pulled back from the firm, fearing that their continued exposure to plunging real estate assets threatened their solvency. Amid the chaos, the co-head of Goldman’s investment bank, David Solomon, reached out to an executive at Bear Stearns: 
            Ten years ago today, David Solomon called the CFO of his alma mater firm, Bear Stearns, to offer Goldman’s assistance. #StreetFighters pic.twitter.com/ow2zu6VIUB  The call left Sam Molinaro, Bear’s C.F.O., feeling uneasy. “When Goldman calls and offers their assistance, it's usually a moneymaking opportunity for them,” Mr. Molinaro said. Of course, within days, JPMorgan, with the backing of the Federal Reserve, had stepped in and agreed to acquire Bear for $2 a share. Mr. Solomon, meanwhile, was anointed the heir apparent at Goldman yesterday. When President Trump signed the sweeping tax overhaul into law late last year, he said, “Corporations are literally going wild over this.” We’re not ones to judge whether that’s an overstatement, but a new study has found that, at the least, many plan on going shopping. Here’s what a survey of 500 American companies with sales of at least $500 million by EY found: • 42 percent of respondents intend to use their tax savings on acquisitions • 73 percent of executives said that they will accelerate their M.&A. planning for the year in any case • 69 percent of respondents say that they’re likely to bring back more cash from overseas under the new tax code The responses to survey suggest that many of the predictions for how companies would use the proceeds from the tax overhaul may prove correct. Though many firms garnered headlines for doling out bonuses to employees or raising hourly wages, analysts and economists largely predicted that corporate America would turn to deal-making, dividends or share buybacks as ways to spend their money. Advertisement “At the end of the day, tax is not a driver of M.&A., but it certainly is a key element,” Bill Casey, EY’s Americas vice chair of transaction advisory services, told me. He added that the removal of uncertainty about taxes, as well as the potential benefits from the overhaul, appears to have lifted companies’ deal-making spirits. Not that M.&A. has been bad so far this year. Announced transactions in the United States for the year to date are up 55 percent from the same time last year, according to Thomson Reuters. And Mr. Casey pointed out that companies already have access to plenty of cheap financing to pursue acquisitions. But for mid-market companies especially, extra money in the pocket can help provide an extra shot of confidence. “There’s more capital being fueled by tax reform, and that will ultimately lead to a better deal market,” Mr. Casey said. Other findings from the survey • 75 percent of respondents said that they are likely to grow their United States manufacturing base in some way • 89 percent said that they planned to “enhance compensation” because of forthcoming tax benefits • 38 percent of mid-cap companies plan to create new jobs, compared to only 19 percent of large-caps • 66 percent are likely to pass some tax savings onto customers — Michael de la Merced Few deal makers that Michael has spoken to since last night can recall such a dramatic scenario: The president intervening in a hostile takeover, citing national security reasons. Advertisement President Trump essentially salted the earth for Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm. Broadcom was ordered to “immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover,” and its nominees for Qualcomm’s board, who had stood a good chance of winning most of the seats, were immediately disqualified. What John Kabealo, a specialist in foreign investment law, told Cecilia Kang and Alan Rappeport of the NYT: “It certainly aligns with the administration’s willingness to be more active in trade and implementing protectionist policies,” he said. “It is definitely a much more activist policy than the previous administration.” Scott Kennedy of the Center for Strategic & International Studies told Bloomberg, “This decision hangs a huge ‘not-for-sale’ sign on just about every American semiconductor firm.” Big question 1: Much has been made of this White House’s protectionism. But Cfius, the government panel that reviews deals for national security concerns, cited Broadcom’s “relationships with third-party foreign entities.” What does that mean? Big question 2: Did Broadcom — which sped up its efforts to move its legal headquarters to the U.S. in apparent defiance of Cfius’s orders — misplay this situation? Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . Big question 3: Does any non-U.S. bidder for an American company now need to worry about Cfius? Critics’ corner:  Brook Sutherland of Gadfly warns, “This should be a warning for future deal makers and would-be friends of Trump.” Considering Qualcomm’s prospects now, Lex says the company “has disappointed before — even without the president’s help.” Market reaction Shares of Qualcomm are down 4.5 percent, while Broadcom’s stock rose 1.7 percent. Rival chip maker Intel, which has been considering a number alternatives in response Broadcom’s pursuit of Qualcomm, gained 2.7 percent. Andrew took the wraps off the Alphabet C.E.O.’s well-hidden side project, which aims to be the Uber of self-flying aircraft before Uber can even get there. More from Andrew’s column: On Tuesday, Mr. Page’s company and the prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, will announce they have reached an agreement to test Kitty Hawk’s autonomous planes as part of an official certification process. The hope is that it will lead to a commercial network of flying taxis in New Zealand in as soon as three years. New Zealand has long been seen as safety-conscious, so its regulations for the vehicles could be a model in the U.S. and elsewhere. Now that the Wall Street titan has officially anointed an up-and-coming disc jockey — a.k.a. David Solomon, longtime investment banker — Lloyd Blankfein’s likely successor, it’s worth considering his priorities: From Dakin Campbell of Bloomberg: Blankfein and the board were impressed, insiders say, by Solomon’s proven ability to build businesses, the strength of the deal making team he assembled and his efforts to recruit and retain talent. Those qualities became even more valuable as the bank decided it had focused too much on hedge funds as trading customers, at the expense of corporations. And in an interview with the Virgin Group founder Richard Branson last month, Mr. Solomon suggested that Goldman — which has added consumer lending to its stable of services — “could move in your direction a little bit.” Advertisement The succession race was Wall Street’s most closely watched, with Mr. Solomon, the outsider investment banker, squaring off against a Goldman lifer and veteran trader, his fellow co-president Harvey Schwartz. From Kate Kelly of the NYT: Late last year, Mr. Schwartz approached Goldman’s lead director, the private-equity executive Adebayo O. Ogunlesi, with an ultimatum, according to people familiar with the exchange. Mr. Schwartz said that unless he was tapped as chief executive in the coming months, he would resign. Mr. Ogunlesi was noncommittal, these people said. Peter Eavis’s take: Morgan Stanley has arguably done more than Goldman to diversify away from trading into more stable businesses like wealth management. A stumble for Goldman’s deal business: It’s fifth in Thomson Reuters’s global league tables, behind Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Lazard. As the current front-runner to replace Gary Cohn, the CNBC commentator would become the White House’s top salesman for its economic policies — and one of the top internal supporters of free trade, when protectionism is ascendant. Why Mr. Kudlow, whose last formal Washington job was in the Reagan administration? From Maggie Haberman and Jim Tankersley of the NYT: Mr. Kudlow, who advised Mr. Trump during his campaign and after he became president, is someone with whom Mr. Trump has a rapport, and he is a media personality whom the president enjoys watching on television, according to aides. Just in time: Mr. Kudlow and Stephen Moore have an op-ed in today’s WSJ on the economy. From the piece: “Mr. Trump’s tax-cutting and deregulatory policies are already pushing out the supply curve, creating real growth that isn’t inflationary.” More context: The apparent discarding of the previous front-runner, Chris Liddell, is another blow to Jared Kushner, for whom he worked.
