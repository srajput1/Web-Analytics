 President Trump will visit a Boeing plant in St. Louis on Wednesday to celebrate the tax cut his party handed to American companies. But lurking in the background is a clash over trade — one in which Boeing is the most vulnerable target. The tariffs on steel and aluminum that Mr. Trump announced last week have already turned iconic American businesses — Harley-Davidson, Levi’s, makers of Kentucky bourbon — into prey for trading partners bent on retaliation. Boeing, which sends 80 percent of its commercial planes abroad, calls itself the nation’s biggest manufacturing exporter. So it is the company with the most at stake in a trade fight — especially in China, one of the fastest-growing aircraft markets. Singled out by the Trump administration as the nation’s primary trade adversary, China has the greatest incentive to respond to the tariffs, economists and other analysts say. Advertisement “The likelihood of retaliation by their biggest single market, China, elevates this from an irritant to potentially disastrous, if not catastrophic,” said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group Corporation, a consulting firm in Fairfax, Va. “A trade war is the simplest way to cut off this fantastic growth they have enjoyed.” Advertisement Boeing has prospered since Mr. Trump’s election. Its shares have soared, and last year it posted record earnings and cash flow. Much of that money was made abroad, though, and a counterattack aimed at Boeing could reverberate into the farthest reaches of the nation’s industrial economy. The company employs 137,000 people in the United States, nearly as many workers as the entire primary steel and aluminum industries. Many more work at its suppliers, from Kansas to Pennsylvania, and those employees would also be at risk of a gut punch if China and other countries chose to make an example of Boeing. “I’m really worried about what it’s going to do to us,” said James Springer, a mechanic who installs stow bins and class dividers on 787 Dreamliners at Boeing’s plant in North Charleston, S.C. “What will the E.U. and China do, especially China? They are one of our biggest customers now.” But China, too, depends on Boeing, and damage inflicted on the company would not be painless. China has a seemingly insatiable need for new aircraft, and can’t yet make them domestically. Boeing is also set to open a finishing plant near Shanghai this year, so the Chinese government may put quality jobs at risk if it were to cut the company off. “If China decides to retaliate, it hurts their airlines and their burgeoning aerospace industry,” said Scott Hamilton, the managing director at the Leeham Company, an aviation consulting firm in Bainbridge Island, Wash. “Why would you do that?” But if China wanted to exact revenge on the United States through Boeing, it would be uniquely positioned to do so. The government has a significant stake in its national airlines and can easily direct them to cancel orders. About a quarter of Boeing’s jetliners went to China last year, and analysts estimate that Chinese orders could account for up to a fifth of its backlog. Until now, Mr. Trump has been a puzzle that Boeing mostly seemed to have figured out. The president began the relationship even before his inauguration by proclaiming his displeasure at the cost of the next-generation Air Force One that Boeing is building. “Costs are out of control, more than $4 billion,” he declared on Twitter. “Cancel order!” 
            Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!         He later told reporters that Boeing was “doing a little bit of a number,” and said, “We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” Advertisement Two weeks later, Dennis A. Muilenburg, Boeing’s chief executive, visited Mr. Trump in Florida and promised to keep the plane’s cost down. “It was a terrific conversation,” Mr. Muilenburg said afterward. “Got a lot of respect for him. He’s a good man. And he’s doing the right thing.” Two months later, the president visited Boeing’s South Carolina plant and, standing before a 787 Dreamliner, proclaimed, “God bless Boeing.” While campaigning, Mr. Trump had repeatedly criticized the Export-Import Bank, which lends so much money to the company’s customers that it has been referred to as “Boeing’s Bank.” But in his first year as president, Mr. Trump decided to keep the bank alive. Mr. Muilenburg has praised the president for the corporate tax cut, calling it “the biggest thing we could do in this country to unleash economic energy.” The past year and a half has indeed been good to Boeing. Its share price went up by 90 percent in 2017, making it the best performer in the Dow Jones industrial average. It has performed spectacularly so far this year. At the end of February, the company cheerily announced that it had arrived at an agreement with Mr. Trump for an Air Force One with a new, lower price tag. “President Trump negotiated a good deal on behalf of the American people,” the company declared on Twitter. Two days later, Mr. Trump said he would pursue steep tariffs on steel and aluminum.

President Trump negotiated a good deal on behalf of the American people. pic.twitter.com/m0HtGfXVlv  “They found themselves bullied,” Mr. Aboulafia said of Boeing. “They very intelligently did the smart thing and befriended the bully, and I think they are starting to find out that being friends with the bully is just as hard as being the victim of the bully.” Advertisement The tariffs alone were never going to cost Boeing very much. It doesn’t use a lot of steel, and the aluminum that encloses the body of its planes amounts to pocket change relative to an engine or the electronics system. The aircraft maker also has flexible, long-term contracts that often allow it to pass on some unanticipated cost increases to its customers, analysts said. Aluminum prices went up by more than 10 percent last year, and no one along the supply chain appeared to flinch. The real risk is that China will lash out, and it’s difficult to say how likely that could be. Boeing and its only real rival on that front, the European company Airbus, have backlogs that stretch into the next decade. A Chinese aerospace company, Comac, flew its first Boeing-sized jet in China in 2016, but it is years away from producing them. That may make it more attractive to punish a different American brand that makes something the Chinese can easily find elsewhere. On the other hand, the Chinese government may have more leverage over Airbus than it seems. China is expected to surpass the United States to become the world’s biggest aviation market by 2022, according to the International Air Transport Association. That growing dominance could help the government lean on Airbus to ramp up production to fill a potential hole left by Boeing, aerospace consultants said. A more moderate option for the Chinese would be to keep current orders on the books, but stop purchasing new Boeing aircraft. That could make for a less intense, but more drawn-out, period of pain for the manufacturer. If it loses significant ground in China, analysts said, Boeing would eventually slow production and fire some of its mechanics. That could cripple the companies that make its airplane wings, noses, nuts and bolts. “There is this rippling effect where Boeing lays off people, and then the suppliers lay off people,” said Rajeev Lalwani, a Morgan Stanley analyst. “That protectionism is in a way coming back to hurt the U.S.” An earlier version of this article misstated the Export-Import Bank’s relationship to Boeing. It lends to Boeing’s customers, not Boeing itself.

2-Mar-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin MARCH 2, 2018
 Good Friday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Would a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal really shift the 5G race? • Mrs. May’s reasonableness may not win over Europe. • Has Gary Cohn reached a breaking point? • The silver linings in President Trump’s tariff plans. • The questions BlackRock is asking gun makers. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Lawmakers have pressed the government panel that scrutinizes deals for national security concerns — known as Cfius — to take a close look at Broadcom’s hostile bid for its fellow chip maker, which includes a proxy fight to gain a majority of Qualcomm’s board seats. (The shareholder vote is scheduled for Tuesday.) Advertisement Most notable among them is Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, whose letter to Cfius raises two issues: • Whether foreign companies like Singapore’s Broadcom can gain control of American counterparts through proxy fights Advertisement • Concern that Broadcom would sell off parts of Qualcomm to win regulatory approval, disrupting the work of the main American developer of 5G wireless technology — and therefore ceding the race for a superfast internet to China The WSJ recently reported that members of Cfius have been examining the former point. It’s an interesting issue since the panel generally doesn’t get involved until a potential transaction has been submitted to it for review, and obviously, there’s nothing of the sort yet. Some officials pointed out that the panel has the jurisdiction to consider board takeovers as a form of foreign acquisition, though the article said that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin isn’t sold yet on the argument. But let’s consider the second point. The WSJ reported that some Cfius members share Mr. Cornyn’s concerns about a weakened or distracted Qualcomm falling behind Huawei of China in the 5G contest. But that ignores Qualcomm’s very public collaboration with Chinese tech companies on 5G. The American chip maker said in January that it has shared information on some of its hardware with Lenovo, Xiaomi and other Chinese companies. And last week, Qualcomm and Huawei announced that they have jointly conducted significant tests for a 5G standard. Here’s what Serge Wilenegger, a Qualcomm Wireless executive, said in the news release: “As the industry works toward the goal of commercial launches of 5G NR products and networks in 2019, close collaboration among global mobile industry leaders is necessary to validate the technologies and continue to build and improve our capabilities.” The research analyst Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein isn’t convinced by Mr. Cornyn’s point either, arguing in an investor note that Intel can also play a role in developing 5G tech and that, more importantly, Broadcom itself is very interested in the wireless standard. Broadcom has a reputation for being a cost-cutter, which Qualcomm has argued would likely stunt its ability to keep innovating. That question hasn’t been settled. But the question of whether a deal would endanger the U.S.’s role in the 5G race appears to go a bit too far. A related consideration: Cfius’s ability to review Broadcom’s moves depends on that chip maker being considered a foreign company. But shareholders of the manufacturer are scheduled to vote on moving its legal residence to the U.S. from Singapore on May 6. It’s unclear whether the panel will act before then — or if it would ultimately have to decide that it has no jurisdiction after that change in address. Advertisement — Michael de la Merced President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs are unlikely to amount to effective policymaking. They target stanch allies and ignore far greater problems in the world trading system. But there may something to salvage from the wreckage. First, on the face of it, the president seems willing to risk a stock market plunge to pursue a policy that Wall Street opposes. Too often, the disfavor of investors is taken as evidence that a policy is terrible when it might be just inconvenient to powerful interests. Second, Mr. Trump’s tariffs have kept an important debate over trade going. One hope for Mr. Trump’s administration is that its skepticism toward free trade leads to policies that help workers whose jobs are vulnerable to free trade. The proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum are unlikely to provide longer-term assistance to workers in those industries. Still, the skepticism toward free trade may now be permanent and provide future administrations with greater leeway to address its drawbacks. — Peter Eavis Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday described the highly preferential relationship her government is seeking to establish with the European Union after it leaves the bloc next year. And to win over skeptics, she attempted to make Britain’s goals seem as reasonable as possible. Her requests for a unique relationship will no doubt get short shrift from those who say Britain cannot be allowed to enjoy the benefits of trading with Europe without accepting most of the obligations. Mrs. May’s response is that both sides can benefit under a new arrangement. She said: We both want good access to each other’s markets; we want competition between us to be fair and open; and we want reliable, transparent means of verifying we are meeting our commitments and resolving disputes. But what is clear is that for us both to meet our objectives we need to look beyond the precedents, and find a new balance. And Mrs. May said Britain would not, as some fear, reduce regulation to win business from the European Union and still expect a high degree of access to the bloc’s markets. She said: But in practice we are unlikely to want to reduce our standards: not least because the British public would rightly punish any government that did so at the ballot box. The big questions: Will the European Union be willing to set up a whole new regulatory infrastructure to oversee a stand-alone trading arrangement with Britain? Why would the bloc go to such lengths when it has the clout to insist that Britain abides by its rules? What would Britain do if the European Union says no to most of what’s in Mrs. May’s speech? It would almost certainly deepen tensions within the British government between those who want a deeply entwined trading relationship with Europe and those who favor a looser one. Mrs. May, who has spent weeks trying to build a consensus in her cabinet, may then find it even harder to present a coherent position to the European Union, giving it even less reason to want to compromise. — Peter Eavis President Trump’s national economic adviser has threatened to quit before, most notably in the wake of the controversy over the violence in Charlottesville, Va. But now that Mr. Cohn apparently has been outplayed in the battle over trade, will he finally decide to depart? The former Goldman Sachs president had managed to hold off trade hard-liners like the policy adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross during previous debates on tariffs. But an exodus of like-minded White House officials diminished Mr. Cohn’s standing — and let his rivals reassert their positions. Advertisement From Damian Paletta and Josh Dawsey of the WaPo: “Gary got rolled and was entirely kept in the dark,” a person close to the White House said of Trump’s top economic adviser. Or as Mike Allen and Jonathan Swan of Axios put it: The tariffs call was also a big middle finger to economic adviser Gary Cohn, who has fought for more than one year to kill tariffs that would provoke a trade war or higher prices for consumers, a de facto tax increase. Our colleagues Mark Landler and Maggie Haberman have reported that Mr. Cohn threatened to resign if the president followed through on the tariff threat. (That cost him standing with Mr. Trump, though he seemed to regain much of his political capital, particularly after the passage of the tax overhaul.) Mr. Landler and Ms. Haberman point out that Mr. Cohn is still waiting to see if Mr. Trump actually rolls out the tariffs — a fair question, given how quickly his boss appears to switch policy positions. But if the White House does impose tariffs on imported aluminum and steel, will Mr. Cohn finally pull the trigger? On a related note, let’s talk about the resuscitation of Mr. Ross’s political fortunes: • Axios, on Jan. 21: “President Donald Trump has put Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross out to pasture,” the publication reported, noting that Mr. Ross had been criticized for falling asleep in meetings. • Axios, today: “White House staff, most of whom were in the dark about Trump’s planned tariffs announcement, are referring to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, the victor in the policy coup, as ‘Chief Ross.’” — Michael de la Merced Expect today to be rough in the markets, after President Trump doubled down this morning on his threat to impose tariffs on international steel and aluminum. S. & P. 500 futures are down in premarket trading, after falling yesterday. 
            When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore-we win big. It’s easy!         
            We must protect our country and our workers. Our steel industry is in bad shape. IF YOU DON’T HAVE STEEL, YOU DON’T HAVE A COUNTRY!         
            When a country Taxes our products coming in at, say, 50%, and we Tax the same product coming into our country at ZERO, not fair or smart. We will soon be starting RECIPROCAL TAXES so that we will charge the same thing as they charge us. $800 Billion Trade Deficit-have no choice!         The current plan: A 25 percent tariff on steel and a 10 percent one on aluminum. The winners: U.S. sellers of industrial metals, like AK Steel and U.S. Steel, whose stocks jumped yesterday; trade hard-liners like Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, Robert Lighthizer, the White House’s top trade negotiator, and Peter Navarro, its trade policy guru. The losers: Big metal consumers like Ford, G.M., Boeing and United Technologies; free-trade proponents like Gary Cohn, who has threatened to resign; many Republican lawmakers; Brazil; and Canada. Advertisement The world’s response: China could retaliate with tariffs on some U.S. goods. The E.U. could, too. Japan and Korea are hoping that, as allies, they would be exempted — but they appear prepared to fight back. The context: George W. Bush imposed tariffs on imported steel in 2002. He lifted them a year later. Peter Eavis’s take: Mr. Trump’s tariffs may be quite narrow in focus and exist for a relatively short period. Investors could learn to live with those. But the U.S. economy and stock markets have some vulnerabilities that could magnify the damage from a trade war. Goldman Sachs’s economists wrote that while the potential tariff’s on imported steel and aluminum “could alleviate political pressure on the White House to pursue other trade restrictions in the near-term,” it would increase “the probability of trade-restrictive outcomes to other pending issues.” On Nafta: “We believe the most likely outcome in the near-term is the announcement of a few small agreements on technical trade issues, but we continue to expect negotiations to stall on major issues like rules of origin and government procurement. There is a good chance that this could eventually lead the President to announce he intends to withdraw from NAFTA, but such an announcement does not appear likely in the near term, in our view.” On China’s practices regarding intellectual property and technology transfer: “We expect that the Administration will ultimately announce restrictions on investment by Chinese companies in the US, and possibly broader trade restrictions, in response to its ongoing Section 301 investigation. The deadline for that decision is not until August, however, and it is not clear when an announcement in this area will be made.” The Commerce Secretary appeared on CNBC and downplayed the impact of President Trump’s planned tariffs, using a can of Campbell Soup. “In a can of Campbell Soup, there are about 2.6 pennies worth of steel. So if that goes up by 25 percent, that’s about six-tenths of one cent on the price on a can of Campbell Soup,” Ross argued. “I just bought this can today at a 7-Eleven ... and it priced at a $1.99. Who in the world is going to be too bothered?” Not everyone agrees with that view: 
            Like most brewers, we are selling an increasing amount of our beers in aluminum cans, and this action will cause aluminum prices to rise. It is likely to lead to job losses across the beer industry. (2/3)         BlackRock, the largest investor in the world, is doubling down on pushing gun makers to consider their responsibilities to the public. BlackRock said that in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., shootings it has been speaking with public gun manufacturers and retailers. “For manufacturers and retailers of civilian firearms, we believe that responsible policies and practices are critical to their long-term prospects. Now more so than ever. That is why, over the past week, we have reached out to the major publicly traded civilian firearms manufacturers and retailers to engage in a discussion of their business practices. We have already had constructive discussions with some, and we are continuing to pursue our engagement with them all.” Blackrock said it is asking companies to answer questions like: • “What is your strategy and process for managing the reputational, financial and litigation risk associated with manufacturing civilian firearms?” • “How do you assess the financial, reputational and litigation risk of the various aspects of your product lines and how each of those products is distributed?” — Andrew Ross Sorkin An article in The Intercept says that not only did the real estate firm — which Jared Kushner led until joining the White House — try to convince Qatar to invest in its embattled 666 Fifth Avenue property in Manhattan, but that it spoke directly with the emirate’s top money man. Advertisement The meeting between Charles Kushner, Mr. Kushner’s father, and Ali Sharif Al Emadi of Qatar was last April, a month before Saudi Arabia and others set up a blockade of the emirate. Mr. Kushner supported the move, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson did not. More from Clayton Swisher and Ryan Grim of The Intercept: The 30-minute meeting, according to two sources in the financial industry who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the potential transaction, included aides to both parties, and was held at a suite at the St. Regis Hotel in New York. A follow-up meeting was held the next day in a glass-walled conference room at the Kushner property itself, though Al Emadi did not attend the second gathering in person. A Kushner Companies spokeswoman said that the company doesn’t “do business with any sovereign funds.” The context: Mr. Kushner’s family business has appeared to become more of a liability to his work in the White House. Remember that he held meetings with top financiers whose firms later lent money to Kushner Companies, which has aroused concerns. Or that several countries have reportedly discussed using his complicated financial ties as negotiating leverage over him. — Michael de la Merced Mr. Trump has long thrived on chaos as an organizing principle. But how much disorder is too much? Remember that the White House has suffered from: very public infighting; off-the-cuff policy proposals by the president; a historically high 34 percent turnover rate; officials threatening to quit to win policy arguments; and an array of investigations into advisers (including Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka) and cabinet members. Jim Stewart spoke with a number of experts for their takes on how the president has been running his White House. Here’s a taster: • Jeffrey Pfeffer of Stanford University, said of the White House’s turnover rate, “This reflects badly on his leadership.” Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . • Charles Elson of the University of Delaware said, “He isn’t bound by any traditional norms of management.” Here’s what the Federal Reserve chairman told the Senate Banking Committee: “Nothing is suggesting to me that wage inflation is at a point of accelerating. I would expect that some continued strengthening in the labor market can take place without causing inflation.” Advertisement But new data from the Commerce Department suggest the opposite: • Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE, rose 0.4 percent, the biggest increase since September. • So-called core PCE, which excludes food and energy, advanced 0.3 percent in January — the largest gain since January 2017. • Year-over-year core PCE, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, rose 1.5 percent in January. In other Fed news: The White House plans to name Richard Clarida, an economist at Columbia University and an executive at Pimco, as the Fed’s vice chairman, the WSJ reported, citing unidentified sources. • Mr. Trump may have switched his position on gun control again, after a meeting with the National Rifle Association.

16-Mar-18,"Advertisement By REUTERSMARCH 16, 2018, 7:27 P.M. E.D.T.
 SEATTLE —  Boeing Co has scrambled to reorganize testing of its new 777X to avoid being delayed by engine snags, while robots and mechanics are starting work on the fuselage, the executive who heads efforts to build the world's largest twin-engined jet said in an interview. Engine supplier General Electric began flight trials of its new GE9X jet engine on Tuesday after a three-month delay caused mainly by a problem in its compressor. But to put the engine development back on track it must build a new component. During that time, Boeing will place two temporary engines on the first flight-test aircraft that is gradually beginning to take shape, starting with its lightweight carbon wings and now the fuselage, which Boeing says is on schedule. The engines, identical in every other respect to the ones that will go into service, will be swapped for fresh ones with the new part before the first 777X carries out its maiden flight next year. The temporary engines will not be fired up, but having them in place will allow other tests to go ahead. Advertisement ""Honestly, when this happened I thought 'this is going to be bad' and we just kept grinding and grinding at it, and we came up with some pretty creative things to test where we could, build where we could,"" 777X Vice President and General Manager Eric Lindblad told Reuters. Advertisement ""To put engines on and then take them off - that is all to protect the schedule,"" Lindblad said. The hurried rejig reflects the fact that after years of planning, production has begun in earnest - something evident from activity inside Boeing's new high-tech wing center. ""We are at the point where it is time to start scaling up the speed that we build things here,"" Lindblad said inside the  1.3 million-square-foot (120,800-square-meter) fabrication plant where machines weave and bake major parts of the carbon wings. The engine swap is also an example of how Boeing is trying to avoid eating into the 'buffer' traditionally built into development schedules. That's because it faces a challenging two years before the latest version of its 777 enters service. ""We are now in the thick of it ... There is no more waiting until later to solve problems,"" Lindblad said. ""There are still two years left. You cannot give away your buffer."" The 777X aims to maintain Boeing's grip on the 'mini-jumbo' market by leapfrogging Airbus SE's 365-seat A350-1000. Boeing has sold over 300 jets, though activity has slowed. 'MORE OPTIMISTIC' So far, Boeing says it is on track to meet a 2020 target for delivering the first 406-seat 777-9 model to Emirates Airline. But although the engine snag marks the first significant public slippage, Boeing has already faced a number of teething problems in building carbon wings and other components. Advertisement ""Everything is hard at this point where you start building an airplane. When you ask me how wing assembly has been going, it's been hard,"" Lindblad said.  . One of the problems involves fitting the carbon panels to the skeleton of spars and ribs, with the light but strong carbon-fiber material less forgiving than traditional aluminum. ""Assuming we continue to march our way through the plan that we have laid out, I feel pretty optimistic about (the engine) and I think that wing assembly is a matter of incorporating the learnings,"" Lindblad said. Six months ago, Lindblad says something else was making him feel ""queasy"". Integration of aircraft systems in a special demonstration lab was not happening as quickly as planned. ""I am more optimistic today,"" he said. He added that he would be ""cautiously guarded"" until the first flight, due in the first quarter of 2019. Another headache has been producing enough wing stringers: reinforcing strips that go outwards from the fuselage. ""I feel confident we have got a plan for that so we are tracking basically back to schedule."" Now Boeing must marry together the various wing parts and  produce the long metallic fuselage. Fuselage panels arriving from Japan have been loaded into a ""Fuselage Automated Upright Build"" (FAUB) machine used to fasten them. Boeing had delays when the machine was tried out on existing versions of the 777, but Boeing says the system is now running at full speed of five planes a month. Drawing on experience of the smaller 737 MAX, which has absorbed production increases on a larger scale, Lindblad said the 777X production system had been set up to handle a targeted speed but would not disclose capacity. Advertisement ""We are planning for world demand,"" he said. The first task is to get flight trials under way so that ambitious fuel-saving goals can be tested. ""Will we get four airplanes in the flight test on schedule? We'll see. I  think we have a pretty good shot at it.""

 SEATTLE —  The smallest member of Boeing Co's upgraded narrowbody jetliner range, the 138-seat 737 MAX 7, began a maiden flight on Friday, the start of several months of trials before entering service next year, the company said. The shortened 737, designed for hot and high conditions or longer journeys than larger narrowbody jets, took off in sunny  weather near Seattle at 10:17 a.m. (1717 GMT), watched by Boeing workers and media. The plane was expected to fly for about three hours over Washington state. The aircraft is the third and smallest member of Boeing's 737 MAX line-up, but has posted relatively modest sales with fewer than 100 estimated orders out of 4,000 for the MAX family.

 SEATTLE —  Boeing Co is studying its options for further increases in production of its medium-haul 737 jet, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said on Tuesday. ""This airplane is in demand, so we are always studying our options,"" McAllister told reporters when asked at a 737 delivery ceremony whether Boeing was considering an increase in 737 output. McAllister was speaking at a ceremony to mark the delivery of the 10,000th 737, the world's most-sold commercial airplane. Airbus's rival A320neo has outsold the 737 MAX since the transatlantic rivals upgraded their best-selling planes with new engines in recent years. Advertisement Both companies use the popular models to fund other developments, and both have begun preparing suppliers and investors for possible increases in production beyond their 2019 targets of 57 jets a month for Boeing's 737 and 60 for Airbus's A320 family. Advertisement A Boeing executive said in February the U.S. planemaker was seeing upward pressure in production rates. Airbus said last month it was considering raising output to 70 a month. McAllister said the supply chain would have to be able to accommodate further production increases ""in its totality""  before Boeing took a decision on whether to increase output. He said Boeing was still pondering whether to launch a new 220-270-seat mid-market jet, but had not made any decision.  . Watched by hundreds of employees at the Renton plant outside Seattle, Boeing handed its 10,000th 737 - an upgraded 737 MAX 8 model - to its largest customer, Southwest Airlines. ""My advice is hang around, we have got more coming,"" McAllister told employees, noting demand for the jet which has flown 23 billion people since entering service in 1968. Employee David Knowlen, 74, witnessed the first 737 roll out of a hangar once used to build B-17 bombers near downtown Seattle more than 50 years ago, when Boeing's upcoming 747 and the supersonic Anglo-French Concorde were making headlines. Since then, it is the small narrowbody jets like the 737 that have dominated aviation's spectacular growth. ""The company was smaller then. Everyone's view was that in 10 years everyone would be flying supersonic,"" he told Reuters.

 CHICAGO —  The head of Boeing Co said on Thursday the U.S. planemaker can absorb transactions on the scale of a proposed tie-up with Brazil's Embraer without putting at risk internal investments in its business or returning cash to shareholders. Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also told Reuters in an interview that Boeing was ""making progress"" in talks with the Brazilian aerospace company. It continues to study a number of possible structures for a deal, which some outside analysts have said could value Embraer at $5-6 billion. ""Acquisitions of the scale of Embraer are not only very doable for us, they are also things we can selectively do, aligned with our (cash deployment) strategy,"" Muilenburg said. ""We have plenty of cash horsepower to do all three things: invest organically, return to shareholders and then make these targeted acquisitions,"" he added. Advertisement Boeing is targeting operating cashflow of $15 billion and combined research & development and capital expenditure of $5.9 billion this year. It has pledged to return 100 percent of free cashflow to shareholders. Advertisement Brazilian President Michel Temer is weighing a proposal for the two companies to forge a commercial aviation venture, his office said last week, after the government opposed an outright takeover of Embraer which also builds military aircraft. ""We are not done yet; there is still work to go. But we are making progress so I am hopeful that we can complete it,"" Muilenburg said, reiterating the deal was not a ""must"" for Boeing. ""We continue to evaluate all parts of the enterprise, different potential ownership structures"" that range from support to full ownership, he said. Boeing shares closed up 0.5 percent at $348.73. Asked whether such overseas tie-ups were more difficult with rising protectionist sentiment, Muilenburg said Boeing would not let up on its global expansion which, if done strategically, would increase jobs in the United States and abroad. OPEN TRADE Speaking in his 36th-floor Chicago office with views across to Lake Michigan, Muilenburg declined to be drawn on the issue of steel and aluminum tariffs just prior to U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement about them on Thursday. He reiterated his longstanding general support for open trade. ""Our position is we want free and open trade, good solid global trade is good for our business and we are going to be strong proponents of that,"" he said.  . Muilenburg downplayed concerns of a backlash from China, which has ordered thousands of jets. Boeing plans to open a new aircraft completion plant in China. ""You see some tough rhetoric but when I look below the surface, and having talked with both President Trump and President Xi (Jinping), I think there is a true desire to have a productive trade relationship between the two countries,"" he said. Advertisement Muilenburg said Boeing had not decided whether to appeal after losing a price dumping case against Canada's Bombardier but would sue again if provoked to do so again. He said Boeing was in ""no rush"" to decide whether to launch a new mid-market jetliner, which could enter service in 2024-25. ""It is a decision we will probably get to over the next year or so,"" he said. The jet is expected to pioneer an advanced production system for Boeing, which is already building on record output of its smaller 737s, Muilenburg said, noting that suppliers are keeping up with demand. Asked about engine makers, most of which have faced technical or management problems in recent years, Muilenburg said: ""It is certainly something we are keeping an eye on. I will say that despite some of the challenges you have seen out there, our engine partners have been doing well on our commercial programs."" Boeing's biggest supplier, General Electric Co, is undergoing a corporate makeover after heavy losses, but it is delivering engines on time for the 737 MAX through its CFM venture with Safran of France, Muilenburg said. Airbus has voiced concern about delays in similar CFM engines. GE, whose stock was the worst performer in the Dow Jones industrial average last year as Boeing led the index higher, is coping well with the development of a new engine for the 777X jet, he said. ""While it is an area to watch, I feel comfortable with where we are at,"" Muilenburg said.

 PARIS —  Boeing Co on Monday ruled out reviving its dormant 767 passenger plane as it continues to ponder options for a potential new niche in the middle of the aircraft market. ""Bringing back the 767 (passenger version) - I just don't see it,"" Randy Tinseth, vice-president of commercial marketing, told reporters on a conference call. There has been some speculation Boeing would revive the 767 wide-body passenger line to offer airlines a low-price backstop in case a proposed brand-new mid-market plane suffered delays, or in case Boeing decided not to go ahead with that project. Boeing continues to target 2024-25 for entry into service of a possible family of jets with 220-270 seats, designed partly to replace single-aisle 757 and some wide-body 767 models. Advertisement ""If it goes beyond that (date), that would be a challenge as (airlines) do have to replace those '57s and '67s,"" Tinseth said. Advertisement Boeing says it is examining the business case for such a jet. Tinseth declined to say when it might make a decision, but industry sources say it could start offering the jet this year. ""We continue to make progress on the program. Things around configuration are coming together,"" Tinseth said, adding Boeing had not decided whether to offer two engine choices or stick with a single engine maker, as on its 737 and 777. The mid-market plane would offer 40 percent lower costs per trip than some wide-bodies - although with shorter range - and it would offer airlines 30-40 percent more revenue than a single-aisle jet ""with little or no additional cost"". Airbus says its largest single-aisle, the A321neo, has already scooped up demand in the market above 200 seats.  . Tinseth said Boeing was meanwhile making progress in filling a production gap between the current 777 large wide-body model and its proposed 777X replacement, due to enter service in 2020. A contributing factor is a recent surge in cargo demand. ""There are a lot of aircraft in the pipeline right now,"" he said, adding the wider aircraft market is ""very strong"". That strength coincides with a slew of available capital as new investors flood into the aircraft market looking for higher yields, despite the growing prospect of interest rate rises. ""The asset class is real. It's not a niche class any more,"" Tim Myers, Boeing Capital Corp president, said on the same call. Advertisement ""We are in the most liquid financing environment I have ever seen in the industry."" Myers said Boeing was in talks with countries representing some of its suppliers to help provide last-resort export funding as the U.S. Export Import Bank remains offline for large deals, due to delays in the confirmation of top officials. Boeing is discussing potential funding with Australia after Britain and Italy stepped up last year, but Myers said it was nonetheless ""extremely important"" to unblock EXIM, which served as a valuable buffer against unexpected shocks in the market. Meanwhile, insurance companies could finance 5 percent of deliveries this year, up from 2 percent last year, he added.

 JERUSALEM —  The Israeli military could decide within months to buy Boeing Co.'s CH-47 Chinook transport helicopters following a strong endorsement by its ground forces, a senior Boeing official said on Sunday. The twin-rotor Chinooks would replace an aging fleet of Sikorsky CH-53 helicopters, which have been in operation since 1969, now manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corp. Israel upgraded them at the turn of the century. Israel does not publish the number of CH-53s in operation but defense industry sources said Israel was interested in buying 20 new helicopters. The chief of Israel's ground forces recommended the Chinooks to the air force, which operates all of the country's military aircraft, Boeing Israel President David Ivry told Reuters. Advertisement ""It's a matter of months. I can't say when exactly, as it is also a question of money – how this matter fits into the IDF's  (Israeli Defence Forces) multi-year budget,"" said Ivry, a former Israeli air force chief.  . The Israeli military and Defence Ministry had no immediate comment. Israeli media has reported that Israel was wary of the high price tag for the helicopter's latest variant, the CH-53K, and last week it quoted an unnamed senior military officer as expressing a preference for the Chinook. Advertisement The German Defence Ministry has said it will also choose between the Chinook and the CH-53K in its own competition to buy 45-60 heavy-lift aircraft to replace its aging fleet of CH-53G helicopters.  It held an information day for industry last month and plans to issue a formal request for proposals later this year. Ivry said the prospective Israeli and German deals had no impact on one another. ""There is no mutual effect as each side is acting on the basis of its own needs,” he said.

 (Reuters) - Boeing Co is doubling down on its landmark new strategy designed to muscle in on the business of maintenance providers by making its next jet the laboratory for in-house services that could radically alter the global business model for selling planes. Unlike Boeing's last all-new design, the 787 Dreamliner, its proposed new mid-market plane will not bring a flood of revolutionary technical designs to the drawing board. But it will give the world's largest plane maker a chance to test its new business approach of designing the plane so that it generates lucrative services revenues for Boeing while also offering efficiencies to airlines over the aircraft’s decades-long lifespan. Along with production costs, the new approach could help Boeing decide whether to invest the $15 billion or more in development needed to build the jet. Advertisement ""If we decide to launch, it's a big investment and it's an investment that has to contemplate not only the product itself but all of our other strategic objectives,"" Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Reuters. Advertisement ""So you can imagine we would want to look at this airplane through the lens of lifecycle value as we are growing our services business,"" he said. Until recently, Boeing and Europe's Airbus sold planes with little involvement in the way they were operated and maintained. Instead, that was work carried out by their own suppliers or third-party shops. Heavy outsourcing on jets like the 787 expanded the trend by leaving suppliers - such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which supplies the 787's carbon wings - in command of key components. While Boeing and others squeezed their balance sheets to launch jets, many of their suppliers used their design influence to forge profitable relationships directly with airlines as they conducted part swaps or repairs required by regulators. ""That seems a little out of balance, doesn't it?"" said Muilenburg, describing how the pendulum is now swinging back to give Boeing more control over parts and therefore the stream of aftermarket services that comes with owning a part's design. ""We do take the majority of the risk in developing new products, and we think that would cause us to want to gain the financial benefit of that risk-taking for the long term,"" he said. The long-term approach to the new jet is the latest evidence of changes in the $180 billion aero-aftermarket as planemakers jostle with suppliers - and even airlines - for control of repairs, training and data in pursuit of higher margins. Advertisement Last year, Boeing centralized services formerly spread across the company in a new division with a goal to more than treble sales to $50 billion in a decade. The new unit posted operating margins of 15.4 percent last year, compared with 16.1 percent that United Technologies Aerospace Systems, a major supplier, earned from selling new equipment, services and aftermarket parts. ENGINEERING DEPTH The aftermarket is not entirely new to Boeing, and is common in defense, where Muilenburg ran services between 2008 and 2009. Airbus set ambitious internal targets last week and Canada's Bombardier Inc is banking on maintenance.  . But after airplane demand peaked since 2014, Boeing has turned more aggressively to parts and services to help meet a target of doubling margins to the mid-teens by 2020. Its core jet margin widened to 9.6 percent last year from 3.4 percent in 2016. To support the strategy, Boeing is bringing back key in-house technology like avionics - the brains of a modern jet -partly with an eye to future aftermarket revenue. ""It is important that we build out vertical capabilities that sustain our engineering depth...as airplanes become more digital,"" Muilenburg said, adding that broader growth in the industry would also provide a boon to suppliers. Suppliers say Boeing is also less willing than before to share risks - and profits - with them on the systems they do build. Instead it wants them to build to Boeing's designs rather than leaving them with keys to the all-important aftermarket. Already, there are signs the mid-market jet could see a swing away from risk-sharing towards straight procurement deals,the head of a major supplier told Reuters. ""It depends on the area of the airplane we are talking about but we are very clear in our intent to grow our services business, and part of that is bringing back inside some engineering and intellectual property,"" Muilenburg commented. Advertisement The downside of doing more by itself, suppliers and analysts say, is that Boeing could weaken access to outside innovation, import risk and tie up capital and finite engineering resources. Depending on how far this goes, industry sources say it may also herald gradual changes in patterns of cash generation. While planemakers get paid on delivery, engine makers charge little upfront and make money on services provided over years. Some analysts say new plane manufacturer strategies suggest those business models could start to converge and put pressure on them to be more generous with discounts on jets. Muilenburg declined to address pricing directly, but acknowledged Boeing's cradle-to-grave services strategy could have some impact on the timing of future income. ""The services business tends to be accretive to margin, but this does give us the flexibility of where we drive margin in the business with the idea of raising the bar overall,"" he said when asked if bundling services could lead to bigger jet discounts.

The IAM petition also comes a few months after the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) made it tougher for workers to form unions made up of small groups of employees, reversing an Obama-era decision that had been sharply criticized by businesses.

 SEATTLE —  Boeing Co has scrambled to reorganize testing of its new 777X to avoid being delayed by engine snags, while robots and mechanics are starting work on the fuselage, the executive who heads efforts to build the world's largest twin-engined jet said in an interview. Engine supplier General Electric began flight trials of its new GE9X jet engine on Tuesday after a three-month delay caused mainly by a problem in its compressor. But to put the engine development back on track it must build a new component. During that time, Boeing will place two temporary engines on the first flight-test aircraft that is gradually beginning to take shape, starting with its lightweight carbon wings and now the fuselage, which Boeing says is on schedule. The engines, identical in every other respect to the ones that will go into service, will be swapped for fresh ones with the new part before the first 777X carries out its maiden flight next year. The temporary engines will not be fired up, but having them in place will allow other tests to go ahead. Advertisement ""Honestly, when this happened I thought 'this is going to be bad' and we just kept grinding and grinding at it, and we came up with some pretty creative things to test where we could, build where we could,"" 777X Vice President and General Manager Eric Lindblad told Reuters. Advertisement ""To put engines on and then take them off - that is all to protect the schedule,"" Lindblad said. The hurried rejig reflects the fact that after years of planning, production has begun in earnest - something evident from activity inside Boeing's new high-tech wing centre. ""We are at the point where it is time to start scaling up the speed that we build things here,"" Lindblad said inside the  1.3 million-square-foot (120,800-square-meter) fabrication plant where machines weave and bake major parts of the carbon wings. The engine swap is also an example of how Boeing is trying to avoid eating into the 'buffer' traditionally built into development schedules. That's because it faces a challenging two years before the latest version of its 777 enters service. ""We are now in the thick of it ... There is no more waiting until later to solve problems,"" Lindblad said. ""There are still two years left. You cannot give away your buffer."" The 777X aims to maintain Boeing's grip on the 'mini-jumbo' market by leapfrogging Airbus SE's 365-seat A350-1000. Boeing has sold over 300 jets, though activity has slowed. 'MORE OPTIMISTIC' So far, Boeing says it is on track to meet a 2020 target for delivering the first 406-seat 777-9 model to Emirates Airline. But although the engine snag marks the first significant public slippage, Boeing has already faced a number of teething problems in building carbon wings and other components. Advertisement ""Everything is hard at this point where you start building an airplane. When you ask me how wing assembly has been going, it's been hard,"" Lindblad said.  . One of the problems involves fitting the carbon panels to the skeleton of spars and ribs, with the light but strong carbon-fibre material less forgiving than traditional aluminium. ""Assuming we continue to march our way through the plan that we have laid out, I feel pretty optimistic about (the engine) and I think that wing assembly is a matter of incorporating the learnings,"" Lindblad said. Six months ago, Lindblad says something else was making him feel ""queasy"". Integration of aircraft systems in a special demonstration lab was not happening as quickly as planned. ""I am more optimistic today,"" he said. He added that he would be ""cautiously guarded"" until the first flight, due in the first quarter of 2019. Another headache has been producing enough wing stringers: reinforcing strips that go outwards from the fuselage. ""I feel confident we have got a plan for that so we are tracking basically back to schedule."" Now Boeing must marry together the various wing parts and  produce the long metallic fuselage. Fuselage panels arriving from Japan have been loaded into a ""Fuselage Automated Upright Build"" (FAUB) machine used to fasten them. Boeing had delays when the machine was tried out on existing versions of the 777, but Boeing says the system is now running at full speed of five planes a month. Drawing on experience of the smaller 737 MAX, which has absorbed production increases on a larger scale, Lindblad said the 777X production system had been set up to handle a targeted speed but would not disclose capacity. Advertisement ""We are planning for world demand,"" he said. The first task is to get flight trials under way so that ambitious fuel-saving goals can be tested. ""Will we get four airplanes in the flight test on schedule? We'll see. I think we have a pretty good shot at it.""

Export credit agency UK Export Finance said the financing for jets being delivered to Korean Air would support jobs in Belfast, where the Canadian planemaker operates a state-of-the-art wings plant. The move comes weeks after Bombardier won a shock reprieve from severe U.S. import duties on the 110-130-seat CSeries when a U.S. tribunal ruled Boeing had failed to prove it had been harmed by low prices of CSeries sold to Delta Air Lines. The Boeing-Bombardier dispute raised questions over jobs at Northern Ireland's largest industrial plant and drew warnings to Boeing over its UK ties from Prime Minister Theresa May, who depends on a Northern Ireland party for her majority. Advertisement Although Bombardier receives some UK development funding, UKEF had long resisted Canadian requests to finance CSeries exports that partly compete with those of Airbus, the European plane giant which employs 12,000 people in the UK. Advertisement The decision to provide support reflects a power shift in the aerospace industry after Airbus agreed to buy a majority of the struggling CSeries last year, and is viewed by some experts as a reminder of ongoing UK interest in the CSeries' future. ""It is a small amount of money but a signal to Boeing,"" a European trade source said, asking not to be identified. For its part, Boeing has signaled it would sue Bombardier again if provoked to do by what it regards as unfair pricing of CSeries jets. But there are signs it is trying to defuse the row as it highlights investments in Canada and Britain. Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Reuters last week Boeing was still examining whether to appeal the International Trade Commission decision to overturn CSeries duties.  . APPEAL DEADLINE However, trade analysts say an appeal looks increasingly unlikely, ahead of a March 12 deadline, as Boeing seeks to smooth over a row which soured relations with Canada and Britain and resulted in the loss of a Boeing fighter sale to Canada. ""We are very mindful of the relationships that we have in Canada and ... we do about $4 billion of supply chain work in Canada every year,"" Muilenburg told Reuters. ""But we also want to make sure that we continue to set a standard for a fair playing field and that we all play by the same rules, and that will be our consistent theme."" Other potential obstacles to UK CSeries aid were lifted when UKEF eased a two-year ban on Airbus funding, resulting from  misleading bids that triggered an Anglo-French corruption probe. Advertisement Airbus said last month it had reached agreement allowing the funding to resume on a case-by-case basis. Korean Air took delivery of its first CSeries in December, becoming the first Asian operator. Its order for 10 jets, with options for at least another 10, suggests the main beneficiary of UKEF support will be Airbus rather than Bombardier. The Airbus CSeries tie-up is expected to be approved in a matter of months. Last July, Boeing itself became an indirect recipient of UK export support when UKEF said it was backing two Boeing 787s to Poland's LOT Airlines. However, the aid is tied mainly to Rolls-Royce engines rather than the airframes. (Reporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Toby Chopra) We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

 NEW YORK —  President Donald Trump's plan to slap tariffs on imported steel and aluminum would barely budge the price of a Boeing Co jetliner or fighter plane, belying fears of a big blow to U.S. industry, aerospace analysts said. What could have an impact is retaliation by countries such as China, one of Boeing's biggest customers, if the United States goes through with threats to tax imported steel by 25 percent and aluminum by 10 percent, they said. As one of the world's largest manufacturers, Boeing provides a window into how double-digit tariffs on raw materials would translate into just a fractional uptick in the cost of finished goods. Boeing makes its planes exclusively in the United States, but nearly 70 percent of the 763 jetliners delivered last year went to customers outside the United States and 22 percent went to China. Aluminum makes up 80 percent of the weight of older model planes such as the 737 and 777 but only about 12 percent of the cost, according to several experts with direct knowledge of Boeing. The rest is labor, overhead and other expenses. Advertisement For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2oPA3Xf A 10 percent aluminum tariff would increase the cost of a plane by about 1.2 percent if all of the aluminum is imported. But most of the aluminum Boeing uses is domestically produced, experts said. Advertisement ""These are big chunks of aluminum that are expensive to transport,"" said Eric Redifer, a director in the aerospace practice of industry consulting firm AlixPartners. He and others estimate only 25 percent to 30 percent is imported, leaving a net impact of about 0.3 percent of a plane's cost. Prices of domestic aluminum are likely to rise if tariffs are imposed, although it is unclear how much.  . On a mid-sized 737, with a list price of $117.1 million, the cost increase could be less than $200,000, because airlines often receive discounts of 40 percent off list price, and Boeing's profit margin is about 10 percent. Boeing declined to comment. The net effect for steel is similar, even though it makes up less of a typical Boeing plane, said Kevin Michaels, aerospace manufacturing expert at AeroDynamic Advisory, a consulting firm in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He estimated Trump's 25 percent tariff on relatively pricey steel would cost U.S. aerospace companies less than $100 million, roughly on par with the overall impact on aluminum. That means the two tariffs would add $150 million to $200 million in cost, or at most about 0.2 percent of $100 billion worth of business jets, jetliners and military aircraft U.S. companies make each year. For Boeing's newer 787, which uses carbon-fiber composite for wings and fuselage, the impact is even less. Aluminum makes up 10 percent of the cost, Redifer said. The result: Trump's aluminum tariff would increase 787 costs about 0.09 percent. ""What will have a material impact is if China retaliates,"" said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. ""They are openly searching for ways to express their displeasure and apply leverage. And it doesn't get any more obvious that going from Boeing to Airbus."" The country's thirst for jets is so great, however, that it likely will need planes from both Boeing and European rival Airbus to keep up with demand, analysts said.

 LONDON —  Britain's Rolls-Royce would be interested in providing an engine for any new middle of the market jet, its chief executive said on Wednesday, if doing so made commercial sense. Boeing is studying a gap between narrow-body jets and long-haul aircraft for a potential new mid-market airplane that could seat 220 to 260 passengers. Rolls-Royce currently specialises in making engines for bigger planes, which carry more passengers. ""We're in the business of selling engines and so naturally we would want to go after that opportunity if it makes commercial sense,"" CEO Warren East told analysts on Wednesday, after the company reported a 25 percent jump in annual profits. ""Strategically it makes perfect sense for us to go after that and that's what we're doing,"" he said.

 PARIS —  Imminent airline decisions on $10 billion of wide-body plane orders could influence the fate of Airbus' A330neo even before the recently upgraded jet completes flight trials, industry sources said. A Tuesday announcement from Hawaiian Airlines that it had dropped its order of six Airbus A330neos in favor of 10 787-9 Dreamliner jets by rival Boeing was a sharp blow to the suffering wide-body program. American Airlines said in January it was reviewing the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner and shorter-range Airbus A330-900, which is in test flights before entering service this summer. The U.S. airline aims to buy some 25-30 wide-body jets and could make a decision in coming days, one of the sources said. Advertisement ""We are still evaluating our widebody options,"" a spokesman for the airline said. Even Boeing's most vigorous supporters doubt Airbus would give up on the A330neo, which is key for its bottom line, but the contest marks the latest in a series of battles between Boeing's newest long-haul jet in the air, the 787 Dreamliner, and upcoming A330neo - a market-share feud that has consumed the two planemakers for the past nine months or more. Advertisement Level, a long-haul budget carrier recently set up by British Airways owner IAG, is also closing in on an order for about 8 planes in the same segment, the sources said. ""We'll wait and see and we'll take advantage of whatever aircraft is available,"" IAG boss Willie Walsh said on Tuesday. Airbus has had patchy results with the latest version of its money-spinning A330, relaunched in 2014 with efficient new Rolls-Royce engines, and has made boosting sales one of its top priorities this year. A330 family output has fallen to six a month from a peak of 10, making the success or failure of Airbus's only profitable wide-body line a key topic for investors. ""The A330 makes money and generates cash, while absorbing a great deal of overhead,"" said Sash Tusa, aerospace analyst at Agency Partners, adding that its long list of customers was useful to Airbus when it came to marketing other planes. HAWAII SWITCH Jitters over the future of the A330neo became apparent when AirAsia, one of Airbus's largest customers, toyed with the idea of switching to Boeing's 787.  . Its decision to uphold an order for 66 jets, first reported by Reuters, eased pressure on the A330neo but analysts say that could change if it feels too exposed as the dominant buyer.. The last major A330neo order was for 28 planes from IranAir but doubts are growing whether that can be implemented any time soon due to U.S. concerns about a nuclear sanctions deal. Advertisement Industry sources agree Airbus is under intense pressure to win at American, preventing further output cuts and gaining valuable bragging rights in future contests across Asia. Keeping the A330neo in the game would also leave less space for a new mid-market plane that Boeing is thinking of launching as early as this year - a 225-275-seat model that partly competes with the A330 family. An Airbus spokesman declined to comment on specific contests, but said, ""Many campaigns are ongoing, building on the 110 airlines who are operating the A330 family today."" After trouncing Airbus in wide-body sales last year, Boeing aims to seize the advantage by targeting Airbus’s slow-selling A330neo with further sales of its competing 787. Some analysts have speculated Boeing would also revive the passenger version of its 767 as a cheaper alternative to the A330, but an executive ruled this out. But keeping A330neo output to a minimum would leave Airbus increasingly dependent on one model, the much newer A350-900, for its position in the wide-body market - mirroring Boeing's predicament in the Airbus-led narrowbody market. As the two marketing armies chase around the globe to the next 787-A330 dog fight, Australia's Qantas and Air New Zealand could be next to step into the battle, sources said.

 PARIS —  European planemaker Airbus said it would meet European works council members later this week to discuss the possible impact on jobs from a decline in the production rates of the A380 and A400M plane programmes. Last week, French business magazine Challenges had reported that Airbus was planning to move or cut 3,600 positions as a result of the issues with the A380 and A400M planes. ""Senior management representatives of Airbus will meet with the European Works Council on 7 March 2018 to explain previously announced rate reductions on the A380 and A400M programmes and to discuss associated implications for the workforce,"" Airbus said in a statement on Monday. ""Airbus deeply regrets that the process on the current subject matter has been disturbed by leaks to the media, which resulted in excessive reporting about alleged job cuts in its four home countries,"" added Airbus. Last month, Airbus - whose main rival is Boeing - announced a 1.3 billion euros (1.2 billion pounds) hit from its delayed A400M military plane programme, although that blow was offset by a rise in Airbus' profits and dividend.

 BRASILIA —  U.S. companies eager to tap into the fast-growing market for low-cost satellite launches could become the first customers when Brazil's Alcantara space center near the equator opens as a commercial spaceport, executives and Brazilian officials said. Aerospace titans Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp in December visited the Alcantara space center, but the Brazilian space agency's launch site is especially attractive to smaller firms because its equatorial location cuts fuel costs by a third. Still, Brazil's aim of becoming a hot new hub in the space industry will depend on negotiating a technology safeguards agreement (TSA) with the United States to protect sensitive American space launch and satellite technology. Without it, no U.S. rocket can blast off from the South American country. Brazil wants to attract customers by marketing itself as the cheaper alternative to Kourou, the European spaceport in neighbouring French Guiana, which mostly launches big satellites. Brazilian officials are hoping to complete a U.S. TSA this year that would facilitate the opening of the commercial spaceport. Advertisement On Feb. 22, U.S. and Brazilian government representatives, along with space companies from both countries, held a conference call with a White House official who was asked whether the Trump administration would agree to a TSA with Brazil, according to a person on the call. Advertisement ""We are encouraged that Brazilian officials have expressed an interest in working more closely with the United States in the space sector,"" a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council said. She gave no further details. The safeguard accord could be ready this year if the U.S. State Department gets negotiating permission, according to industry representatives. Tucson, Arizona-based Vector Launch Inc, which specializes in small rockets, appears eager to launch from the Brazilian site. The company wants to undercut big payload specialists like billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX by launching so-called microsatellites from small rockets, cutting costs and wait time for clients. ""Our vision is to launch hundreds of Vector rockets into orbit to satisfy the growing market for microsatellites,"" said Vector Vice President Alex Rodriguez, who made a December visit to Alcantara coordinated by Boeing. ""We are closer to the equator and have an excellent site for launching microsatellites,"" said Brigadier Luiz Fernando Aguiar, coordinator of the Brazilian Air Force's space program, comparing the Alcantara site with Kourou. Alcantara has radars, a runway and a seaport to unload equipment, along with plenty of open land to store rockets and build a liquid oxygen plant if needed, he said. A previous attempt at a U.S.-Brazilian space partnership was scuttled in 2003 when the technology safeguards agreement faced resistance from the leftist government of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and was thwarted by Brazilian lawmakers. The new effort is expected to pass easily in a more conservative Brazilian Congress.  . FAST-GROWING NICHE While the market for launches of large geosynchronous satellites has solidified, the Space Enterprise Council, which represents U.S. industry from launch services to satellite manufacturers, has said the expanding microsatellite sector could experience up to 600 launches for satellites under 110 pounds (50 kg) between now and 2022. Advertisement Alcantara could capture 25 percent of that market, according to the council, which has said a U.S.-Brazilian partnership would give both countries an edge in the fast-growing segment. The cost of microsatellites is a fraction of larger satellites options, making them increasingly important for GPS navigation, Earth imagery, surveillance and internet communications. Boeing, which chairs the Space Enterprise Council, is in talks to partner with Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial planemaker and the main player in the Brazilian aerospace industry. SpaceX was not represented on the visit to Alcantara and is not a member of the council, which also includes Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Corp and Viasat Inc. After Brazilian officials last month said SpaceX was on the trip, the company said that was incorrect and that it was not interested in launching from Brazil. Viasat last month entered the satellite broadband businesses in Brazil with an agreement to use capacity on the country's 5-tonne SGDC-1 geostationary satellite launched last year from Kourou and operated by state-run telecom company Telebras. Brazil abandoned plans to build its own rocket to put large satellites in orbit after an explosion and fire in 2003 at Alcantara killed 21 people. The country is developing a smaller rocket for microsatellites that will be launched from Alcantara next year, boosted by engines developed by the German Aerospace Center.

 President Trump’s vow to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum next week rattled financial markets Thursday. Stocks, which had already been down for the day, slipped further after the White House announced the planned tariffs. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 1.2 percent to 2,682 Thursday afternoon, after falling roughly 2 percent earlier in the day. Shares of automakers such as Ford and General Motors, large consumers of steel and aluminum, fell sharply, as the tariffs would raise the cost of raw materials. “Historically, the automakers have to absorb these costs,” said Colin Langan, an analyst at UBS who covers automakers. “Consumers don’t adjust their price expectations based on higher steel prices.” Advertisement Shares of industrial companies also dropped, led by exporters such as Boeing and United Technologies. Advertisement On the other hand, some companies that sell industrial metals saw their stock prices rise, with shares of AK Steel up roughly 8 percent and U.S. Steel jumping more than 6 percent. The prospect of a protectionist policy push forced investors Thursday to rethink whether that could derail a global economy that has been growing across the board over the last year. In fact, until Mr. Trump’s comments on Thursday, the prevailing worry for investors seemed to be that economic growth — both in the United States and around the world — was so robust that the Federal Reserve might move quickly to raise interest rates in order to fend off inflation.

2-Mar-18,"Advertisement Supported by By Reuters BENGALURU, India — Middle East budget carrier Air Arabia will add more destinations and could order around 100 narrow-body aircraft this year, thanks to rising demand in Egypt and other hubs, Chief Executive Adel Ali said on Wednesday. The expansion from the United Arab Emirates' only publicly listed airline comes amid rising oil prices and after a year in which Air Arabia's profit increased 30 percent to a record 662 million dirhams (129.7 million pounds), as it flew more passengers and operated more routes. The airline is considering placing new orders for the first time in several years to support future growth. ""It doesn't necessarily have to be a purchase order. The leasing market is pretty good,"" Ali said in an interview in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru. In November, Air Arabia announced a leasing agreement for six Airbus A321neo long-range jets from U.S.-based Air Lease Corp. ""Our technical team and financial team are working with both Boeing and Airbus,"" Ali said. The Sharjah-headquartered airline currently operates an all-Airbus A320 narrow-body fleet of around 50 jets. Ali did not rule out a deal for CSeries jets made by Canada's Bombardier, though suggested a preliminary agreement by an airline Air Arabia now partly owns was no longer valid. Petra Airlines, in which Air Arabia bought a 49 percent stake three years ago, signed a letter of intent with Bombardier in 2014 to buy up to four CSeries jets in a deal worth up to $300 million at list prices. ""Petra as an airline was finished a long time ago. That's history. Everything that was there is gone,"" he said. Petra was rebranded Air Arabia Jordan in 2015 with the opening of Air Arabia's fourth hub in Amman. Ali said Air Arabia would sharpen its focus on Egypt this year as demand increases. ""We see the tourists coming back, trade is coming back. We have slowed down in Egypt for some time now because of geopolitical and economic uncertainties. We now see certainty there,"" he added. The carrier also expects to grow in Russia and some former Soviet states this year. The 2018 FIFA World Cup will be held in Russia, which is expected to spur demand.

 PARIS —  Airbus has set a goal of tripling services revenues from its commercial aircraft business to $10 billion within seven years and sharply reducing the number of times its jets are stranded on the ground for technical reasons, industry sources said. It also targets measures worth 450 million euros ($555 million) in 2018 to improve productivity and has told staff reducing recurring costs on its newest jets - the A320neo and  A350 - remains a battle, they said, citing internal postings. The latest sign of competitive pressures comes as Airbus prepares to announce possible job cuts due to slower production of its largest aircraft - the A380 superjumbo and theA400M military air lifter - at a staff meeting on Wednesday. Airbus said earlier it would address implications of the slowdown at a works council meeting, but described reports of3,600 jobs cuts or redeployments as ""excessive"". Advertisement Like rival Boeing, Airbus is driving down manufacturing costs while branching into more profitable services, in a bid to emulate the wider margins of third parties who traditionally control the market for repairs and services. Advertisement However it has so far given little detailed guidance on targets by business activity. An Airbus spokesman, in response to a Reuters query, confirmed the $10 billion service revenue target for the main jets division. He said the company has for some years had a rolling productivity target, but declined to give details.    ""Like any leading company ... year-on-year we strive for continuous improvements, unleashing further efficiencies in every business area, strengthening our competitiveness and focusing on our customers,"" the spokesman said. DIGITAL SERVICES Chief Executive Tom Enders told analysts last month the total services business across Airbus's jetliner, helicopter, defense and space activities was worth 9-10 billion euros. He said Airbus mainly aims to improve that through internal growth, striking a different tone from Boeing which has been more explicit about eyeing acquisitions on its way to a goal of more than tripling services revenues to $50 billion by 2027. ""...certainly, we don't exclude other measures but the focus is not on M&A. The focus is on organic growth of the services business,"" Enders told analysts.  . Airbus Commercial made up 76 percent of revenue in 2017. Enders has put emphasis on new digitally based services such as its new Skywise predictive maintenance system, following deals with AirAsia, Asiana Airlines and Etihad Airways. But while setting its sights on the after market, Airbus has been wrestling with delays and sporadic reliability problems, which it blames partly on engine maker Pratt & Whitney. A number of planes have been forced out of service temporarily to switch engines, but the internal targets suggest Airbus is also concerned about quality problems that fall more directly under its control, two industry sources said. Advertisement Airbus aims to reduce the number of ""aircraft on ground"" incidents by at least 30 percent over the next two years. It also aims to cut by 20 percent the amount of time it takes to come up with a fix for a problem when it is identified after a plane has entered service. Inside its factories, it aims to reduce the amount of costly outstanding or out-of-sequence work and ensure that 85 percent of quality checks known as ""green quality gates"" are successful. The cost-and-quality drive comes as Airbus accelerates record output to meet demand - a trend that can quickly create headaches if productivity lags behind. Airbus aims to boost deliveries by 11 percent to 800 aircraft in 2018, including 30that it could not hand over last year due to engine problems.    Reaching that goal and ensuring over 80 percent of jets are delivered on time is essential, Airbus staff have been told.

 NEW YORK — U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday after President Donald Trump sought to impose fresh tariffs on China, intensifying fears of a trade war that could raise costs and hurt overseas sales for U.S. companies. The Trump administration is pressing China to cut its trade surplus with the United States by $100 billion, the White House said Wednesday. Trump is looking to levy tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports, targeting the technology, telecom and apparel sectors, sources told Reuters on Tuesday. As earnings season has ended, the latest developments in Washington are even more prominent for investors, said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Massachusetts. Advertisement ""Certainly, from an economic standpoint, the potential effect of tariffs continues to rattle through the markets,"" he said. Advertisement ""We're in a wallowing period where there's not as much good news coming out."" Trump has already imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports as well as on solar panels and washing machines, sparking threats of retaliation from some trade partners. Boeing Co, which investors say may be particularly vulnerable to retaliation, tumbled 2.5 percent, leading the losers on the Dow.

 BRUSSELS —  IAG could consider buying more A380s from Airbus if the superjumbo was cheaper, CEO Willie Walsh said, adding that he was also looking at planes for the airline group's new carrier Level. IAG operates the British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus airlines, as well as Level, a low cost unit launched last year which flies between Europe and the United States. IAG already operates 12 A380s, and could be interested in buying more if Airbus improved the pricing, Walsh said, although the airline was not currently negotiating with Airbus. ""The pricing that Airbus has offered in the past is unacceptable to us,"" Walsh said on the sidelines of a conference hosted by industry body Airlines for Europe. Advertisement ""We've said very clearly to Airbus if they want to sell A380s they need to be aggressive on pricing and when they work out how to sell the aircraft, knock on our door and we'll talk to them."" Advertisement Airbus secured the future of the superjumbo when it agreed a deal with airline Emirates in January for up to 36 A380s worth as much as $16 billion at list prices. For Barcelona-based Level, Walsh said he would need to buy planes to meet a plan to grow the fleet to 30 aircraft by 2022, and would consider a number of different aircraft. ""I think in five years' time, I think there might be opportunities for a different aircraft type,"" he said, suggesting that Level would not just stick to the A330s it currently operates. ""There are Airbus options with the A330-neo or the A350 and as I said more and more we'll see Boeing 787s becoming available at that stage,"" Walsh said, noting that 787s may become an option in the coming years, if their price comes down or second-hand planes become available.  . Those decisions may fall to Level's new chief executive. Walsh said IAG was in the final stages of interviews to appoint a CEO for Level. Among Walsh's other concerns is the building of a new runway at Heathrow Airport in London, where IAG's biggest airline British Airways is based. IAG would be interested in running terminals at Heathrow, Walsh said. The company already runs a terminal at JFK airport in New York and Walsh cited the example of Munich's terminal 2, run as a joint venture between airline Lufthansa and the airport, as a ""good example"" of how this can be done. ""Would I like to run Terminal 5? Absolutely,"" Walsh said when asked about his interest in running parts of Heathrow. Advertisement Walsh has long-complained about the cost of a proposed new runway at Heathrow, and a lack of competition at the airport, and has recently called for Britain to allow other operators to build facilities and run terminals at Heathrow. ""We know how to do it (run terminals) and we know the benefit that that can bring so we're open to doing it,"" he said.

 LONDON —  Virgin Atlantic's chief executive said he was confident a deal would be done to secure Britain's flying rights after Brexit, as the airline launched an extra legroom economy seat to try to stand out from the crowd amid intense competition. British airlines want to be able to continue to benefit from European Union flying rights after Brexit, and the British government has said it will try to secure an open-access deal, but a recent Financial Times report suggested the UK was encountering problems in its negotiations. Craig Kreeger, the CEO of Virgin, which primarily flies between the UK and North America, said he believed Britain would secure a deal similar to what it already has under the European Union-United States Open Skies agreement. ""I’ve heard from both governments, I remain completely confident that we’re on track, to work, through whatever it takes to have, to be able to fly, in an Open Skies-like way,"" he said in an interview with Reuters. Advertisement Kreeger was speaking as Virgin Atlantic on Wednesday announced that it would refit the cabins of its Boeing 787 Dreamliners to offer a new type of economy seat with legroom of 34 inches (86 cms), bigger than the 31 inch economy offering. Advertisement Virgin also said it would offer an ""economy light"" ticket which excludes checked luggage. It gave no information about ticket prices, with the new seats not available for sale until Spring. The new offering comes amid tough competition on the trans-Atlantic route, with low-cost carriers such as Norwegian Air Shuttle, Canada's Westjet and Iceland's Wow Air all stepping up expansion between North America and Europe. ""There isn't any question that trans-Atlantic flying has been changing over the last few years and being able to offer a new lower fare is something we think will enhance our ability to compete,"" Kreeger said.  . IAG, the owner of Virgin's old rival British Airways, is also in on the action, launching a low-cost long-haul unit called Level last year, while Lufthansa has been expanding its Eurowings brand, and U.S. carriers have introduced fares that don't include baggage or seat selection. Virgin said the refitting of its cabins was underway and the cost of taking out six seats to make space for the new bigger leg room economy class was ""not material"". The new 34-inch legroom seat on Virgin will give passengers an option in between economy and Virgin's premium economy seat. British Airways and Norwegian also offer economy seats with 31 inches of legroom. Both British Airways and Virgin offer legroom of 38 inches in their premium economy, while Norwegian's premium cabin has legroom of between 43 and 46 inches. Last year, Virgin Atlantic said Air France-KLM would buy 31 percent of the airline from Richard Branson's Virgin Group, making it the second largest shareholder after U.S. airline Delta, which owns a 49 percent stake, and reducing Virgin Group's stake to 20 percent.

 NEW YORK —  The S&P 500 ended slightly lower after Wednesday's volatile session as investors struggled to get a read on U.S. trade policy after President Donald Trump promised hefty import tariffs but then said Mexico and Canada could be exempt. After falling as much as 0.97 percent, the S&P regained ground after the White House appeared to add exceptions to its stated plan to slap import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. Worries about a potential trade war had intensified after free trade supporter Gary Cohn resigned from his position as Trump's top economic advisor late Tuesday. But late on Wednesday White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump is expected to sign something by the end of the week with ""potential carve-outs for Mexico and Canada based on national security, and possibly other countries as well"" Advertisement ""It makes investors less worried if the tariff isn't applied so broadly. But it's speculation at this point. We have nothing in writing.

The Dow was dragged down partly by manufacturer stocks such as Caterpillar, which fell 1.5 percent, and Boeing, which ended 0.5 percent lower. Both those stocks have been under pressure since the tariff plan was first announced on Thursday as they could be hurt by both higher metal prices and any retaliatory trade barriers erected by foreign countries where they sell their products.  . The S&P energy sector was one of the weakest of the S&P's 11 sectors with a 0.8 percent drop as it was also weighed down by a 2 percent drop in oil prices <CLc1> from data showing a rise in U.S. inventories and output. [O/R] The Russell 2000 index, which tracks U.S. small-cap stocks, outperformed the larger-cap indexes with a 0.8 percent gain.

The S&P's technology index was also a bright spot with a 0.6 percent increase.

 Montreal —  With its new long-range business jet just preparing to take flight, Bombardier is banking on sales of new products and maintenance packages to help it drive promised double-digit revenue growth for its aftermarket service business this year. Bombardier, which considered bankruptcy in 2015 after facing a cash-crunch, is in the middle of an aggressive turnaround plan that leans on the delivery of its new long-range, Global 7000 business jet to achieve a 25 percent jump in total company revenues to $20 billion by 2020, compared with 2017. But with demand now flat for other jets and the new Global 7000 just starting to come off the line this year before picking up the pace in 2019 and 2020, Bombardier is counting on upside from the so-called aftermarket business of servicing existing jets. The Canadian company expects its business jet division will, by year's end, maintain 35 percent of the 4,700 in-service jets it has sold over the years, up from 25 percent in 2017, according to Bill Molloy, vice president, aftermarket sales and commercial strategy of Bombardier's business jet division. Advertisement That will help generate double-digit revenue growth this year from such aftermarket services, which it expects will rise by $500 million in total through 2020, he told Reuters. Advertisement Bombardier does not disclose revenue figures for its aftermarket services business, but total revenues from Bombardier’s business aircraft are expected to grow to $8.5 billion in 2020, up from $5 billion in 2017. New requirements for global positioning systems in planes, along with demand for improved avionics, faster internet service and other offerings, are expected to draw in more customers for its jet maintenance. ""You bring the aircraft into your facility and then you've got the opportunity to apply your modifications and upgrades,"" Molloy said.

 Montreal —  With its new long-range business jet just preparing to take flight, Bombardier is banking on sales of new products and maintenance packages to help it drive promised double-digit revenue growth for its aftermarket service business this year. Bombardier, which considered bankruptcy in 2015 after facing a cash-crunch, is in the middle of an aggressive turnaround plan that leans on the delivery of its new long-range, Global 7000 business jet to achieve a 25 percent jump in total company revenues to $20 billion by 2020, compared with 2017. But with demand now flat for other jets and the new Global 7000 just starting to come off the line this year before picking up the pace in 2019 and 2020, Bombardier is counting on upside from the so-called aftermarket business of servicing existing jets. The Canadian company expects its business jet division will, by year's end, maintain 35 percent of the 4,700 in-service jets it has sold over the years, up from 25 percent in 2017, according to Bill Molloy, vice president, aftermarket sales and commercial strategy of Bombardier's business jet division. Advertisement That will help generate double-digit revenue growth this year from such aftermarket services, which it expects will rise by $500 million in total through 2020, he told Reuters. Advertisement Bombardier does not disclose revenue figures for its aftermarket services business, but total revenues from Bombardier’s business aircraft are expected to grow to $8.5 billion in 2020, up from $5 billion in 2017. New requirements for global positioning systems in planes, along with demand for improved avionics, faster internet service and other offerings, are expected to draw in more customers for its jet maintenance. ""You bring the aircraft into your facility and then you've got the opportunity to apply your modifications and upgrades,"" Molloy said.

 LONDON —  Rolls-Royce said it was on track to meet its 2020 goals after beating forecasts last year, providing evidence that CEO Warren East's plan to rebuild one of the biggest names in British manufacturing was paying off. Shares in aero-engine maker Rolls gained 13 percent to 939 pence on Wednesday, their highest level since November, after its 2017 pretax profit rose 25 percent to 1.071 billion pounds, beating a consensus forecast of 878 million pounds. Rolls had recorded a record loss for 2016. East has been trying to reshape Rolls during his three years in charge after declines in some of its older aero-engine programmes and plunging demand for oil equipment hit it hard. The company stuck to a goal of generating free cash flow of 1 billion pounds by around 2020, despite the impact of a costly programme to repair its Trent 1000 engines. Advertisement ""Looking at today's announcement, we sense the Rolls-Royce story is finally coming of age,"" said Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris, who has a ""Buy"" recommendation on the stock. Advertisement Rolls said it would continue with a cost-cutting strategy, adopted as part of the turnaround, after an earlier plan saved about 200 million pounds over the 2015-2017 period by cutting layers of management and shortening manufacturing times. ""The reality is there is more simplification that we need to do to make ourselves truly competitive and fit for the future,"" East told reporters on Wednesday. He declined to put a figure on savings from this latest plan but said it would remove duplication and result in ""significant cost reduction"". Some 600 senior managers left the company after the initial restructuring. DIVIDEND BOOST? The strong performance in 2017 was driven by a jump in engine deliveries and higher maintenance volumes. Rolls also reported rising sales in its power systems business, which makes engines for use in trains, agriculture and mining. ""We're seeing this as an encouraging set of results,"" East said. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst George Salmon said the performance should convince any investors still sceptical about East's plans and the results raised hopes about the dividend, which the company had halved in 2016 to shore up its finances. ""The chances of Rolls-Royce meaningfully increasing its returns to shareholders in the years to come look much better now,"" he said.  . Rolls paid out 11.7 pence per share for 2017, unchanged from the previous year. ENGINE REPAIRS Rolls would take a hit of about 340 million pounds this year to account for the cost of carrying out repairs on existing engines, primarily the Trent 1000 installed on Boeing 787s. ""Clearly the engine issues are significant,"" said East. ""However, we are being transparent with our customers, we're being transparent with the market. We're prioritising resolving the situation for our customers. We have our arms around the solution."" Advertisement Rolls has said that 400 to 500 Trent 1000 engines were affected by problems with components wearing out earlier than expected, needing extra inspection and maintenance. Air New Zealand, British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Japan's ANA Holdings are amongst those affected. For 2018, Rolls forecast group underlying operating profit of about 400 million pounds, give or take 100 million pounds. At the lower end of expectations that would represent a decline from its 2017 level of 321 million pounds. That broad guidance was issued under a new accounting standard, which changes how the company books earnings on long-term contracts. Another part of East's turnaround plan is the potential sale of the Rolls-Royce's loss-making commercial marine business, the part of the business which designs and makes equipment used in oil and gas extraction. ""At this stage there's no new news, we'll update you when we've got something to talk about,"" Chief Financial Officer Stephen Daintith told reporters, adding that the update could come in May at its annual meeting or in June at an investor day.

14-Mar-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin MARCH 14, 2018
 Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Theranos shows private companies can be held to account t.oo • Was Bear a bad deal for JPMorgan? • The failed Qualcomm bid portends a new front in potential global trade wars. • How Boeing has the most to lose from the metals tariffs. • Bear Stearns was a decade ago. Could it happen again? • And R.I.P. Stephen Hawking. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday charged Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, with fraud for raising money from investors on the back of false claims about the company’s blood-testing technology. One of Theranos’s main products, called a miniLab, could not perform all the tests the company said it could, the commission asserted. That, according to the complaint, didn’t stop Theranos from claiming that it had a bright future ahead. Advertisement Here are some of the things the commission says Theranos, a private company, did to pull the wool over investors’ eyes. Advertisement It allegedly performed tests on non-Theranos equipment without telling representatives of a pharmacy company that was poised to invest money in the company. Based on Holmes’ presentation, Pharmacy A executives understood that the blood from their demonstration samples would be tested on Theranos’ miniLabs. Holmes never told the executives that Theranos was actually testing some of their blood on modified third party analyzers. Theranos allegedly distributed fake reports by pharmaceutical companies. Investors believed that pharmaceutical companies had written their own endorsements of Theranos’ technology, when the pharmaceutical companies had not. Theranos allegedly made misleading statements about its work with the United States Department of Defense. While Theranos’ technology was used in a D.O.D. burn study, it was never deployed by the D.O.D. in the battlefield, in Afghanistan, or on medevac helicopters. From 2011 to 2014, Holmes had discussions with multiple divisions of the D.O.D. However, Theranos generated only approximately $300,000 from three D.O.D. contracts. Ms. Holmes allegedly told an investor Theranos expected to expand quickly in the stores of a pharmacy chain, but the likelihood of such an expansion was small. Holmes was aware that Theranos’ retail roll out with Pharmacy A was stalled due to, among other issues, some concerns Pharmacy A executives had with regard to Theranos’ performance. The Food and Drug Administration communicated to Theranos that its approval would be needed, but Ms. Holmes allegedly told investors afterward that F.D.A. approval was merely voluntary. Holmes’ statements that Theranos did not need F.D.A. approval or clearance were important to investors because approval or clearance would have been an obstacle in the company’s path to realizing full commercialization. Ms. Holmes allegedly gave investors fake financial results. Holmes also provided historical financial information to one potential investor. In August 2015, Holmes met with a potential investor, during which she provided Theranos’ financial results for fiscal year 2014. These financials showed 2014 net revenues of $108 million, and 2015 and 2016 net revenue projections of $240 million and $750 million, respectively. But Theranos’ actual financial performance bore no resemblance to the financial information Holmes shared with investors. Theranos recorded little more than $100,000 in revenue in 2014 and was nowhere near generating $100 million in revenue by the end of 2014 — Peter Eavis There is an old adage that if it sounds too good to be true, it isn’t. The case filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes describes a litany of falsehoods about a claimed revolutionary method to conduct blood tests that turned out to be pure fiction. Ms. Holmes and the company settled the case, although the former president, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, is fighting the charges. She will pay a $500,000 penalty, return her shares in Theranos, and agreed to a ban on serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years. What makes this case interesting is that Theranos was one of the original unicorns, a private company with a value of more than $1 billion. We usually see the S.E.C. pursue charges against public companies and their executives, while private firms operate largely free from scrutiny – at least until they prepare for an I.P.O. Advertisement The antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, however, apply to any transaction in a security in which there is a misstatement of material fact. Thus, when Theranos raised millions of dollars by selling shares to hedge funds and venture capitalists, the false claims about the viability of its blood-testing labs ended up being a scheme to defraud. For Ms. Holmes, the settlement means that she will be cut off from raising money for any new venture for a long time. The complaint shows a systemic effort to deceive investors over a number of years, no doubt in a desperate hope that somehow the technology could be made to work. It is unlikely anyone in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street will trust her again. — Peter J. Henning Mr. Kudlow, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, said that Mr. Trump offered him the job as director of the National Economic Council and that he immediately accepted. Mr. Kudlow told The Journal that an announcement could come as early as Thursday. Reaction Mark Hamrick, Bankrate.com’s senior economic analyst: “It remains to be seen whether Kudlow can step into the role of a virtual moderating influence in this administration. Unlike others in this White House, he does have experience in government and the private sector. But unlike television where on-air conflict is sometimes mostly for show, the health of the national and global economy is at stake here.” Ten year’s ago almost to the day, JPMorgan Chase acquired Bear Stearns, a troubled investment bank, for what looked like a steal. But Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s C.E.O., has since said he wouldn’t do a deal like it again, citing the high legal costs that came later. But was buying Bear Stearns as bad a deal as Mr. Dimon suggests? While we don’t have all the numbers necessary for a full accounting, there is much in the public domain that can help answer this question. And this information suggests that, while the Bear Stearns acquisition probably wasn’t as profitable as expected in March 2008, JPMorgan may still have benefited from it — even after taking into account the legal expenses. What caused the legal costs and how big were they? The payouts were made mostly to settle allegations that Wall Street firms had stuffed loans into mortgage-backed bonds that did not meet agreed upon standards. How big were those costs? In his 2015 letter to shareholders, Mr. Dimon said that some 70 percent of JPMorgan’s nearly $19 billion in mortgage-related legal costs were related to Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, the thrift JPMorgan also bought during the crisis. For the sake of argument, let’s assume that 35 percent of that $19 billion stemmed from Bear Stearns’ mortgages. The cost to JPMorgan then would be around $6.7 billion. That’s a lot, but when JPMorgan did the deal, it agreed to terms that gave it a lot of financial protection against nasty surprises like this. JPMorgan paid $1.5 billion for Bear Stearns, far below the $11.8 billion of shareholders’ equity that Bear Stearns reported on its balance sheet at the end of 2007. This wide margin for error would have helped the bank absorb the $6 billion of merger-related costs that executives anticipated in March 2008. Advertisement True, JPMorgan almost certainly ended up marking down Bear Stearns’ riskier assets by more than expected in the months after the deal, when market conditions got even worse. But many of these assets could have recovered in the next few years as the financial system stabilized. After 2008, “principal transactions” at JPMorgan’s investment bank, the business line that included the performance of many of Bear Stearns’ assets, produced over $8 billion of annual revenue, far more than the $4.4 billion that JPMorgan on its own generated in 2007. Let’s also not forget that the Federal Reserve took a large slug of the risk in the deal. The Fed made an extraordinary loan to a special entity that bought some $30 billion of Bear Stearns’ assets. According to Kate Kelly’s book on Bear Stearns’ final days, JPMorgan was reluctant to buy Bear Stearns without assistance from the Fed. JPMorgan did provide a $1.2 billion loan to the Fed’s entity, in theory exposing it to some losses on the assets. But in the end, that loan generated a $665 million gain for JPMorgan in 2012. The Bear Stearns deal also came with some straightforward positives. JPMorgan, for instance, got Bear Stearns’ leading prime brokerage unit, a business that provided brokerage services to hedge funds. That and other Bear Stearns operations were expected to add at least $1 billion a year to JPMorgan earnings, the bank’s executives said at the time. And, of course, JPMorgan scooped up Bear Stearns’ trophy tower in Midtown Manhattan. At the time of the deal, the building, at 383 Madison Ave., had an estimated value of $1.2 billion. According to the estimates of developers in the New York real estate market, the building is now worth at least $1.8 billion. -- Peter Eavis with reporting from Charles V. Bagli. Jun Ying, the former chief information officer of Equifax’s core United States consumer reporting division, was charged on Wednesday with insider trading for selling nearly $1 million in company stock after he learned about a major data breach in 2017 but before it was publicly announced. Cybertrails The commission’s complaint against Mr. Ying describes a step he took to estimate what he might lose on his Equifax stock. He took to the internet to find out what had happened to the shares of Experian, a rival credit bureau, after it revealed that hackers had breached its system. At approximately 10:00 a.m. on Monday, August 28, 2017, Ying used a search engine to find information on the internet concerning the September 2015 cybersecurity breach of Experian, another one of the three major credit bureaus, and the impact that breach had on Experian’s stock price. The search terms used by Ying were: (1) “Experian breach”; (2) “Experian stock price 9/15/2015”; and (3) “Experian breach 2015.” — Peter Eavis When he killed Broadcom’s pursuit of Qualcomm, President Trump put his administration in uncharted territory. The White House has made no secret of its concerns about Beijing, and seems to have been motivated by the prospect of Qualcomm losing its lead in 5G. Some now worry that this could be another front in a potential global trade war. Here’s Jason Furman, a senior economic adviser in the Obama White House, talking to the NYT: “If every country in the world conducted policy like that, it would make cross-border investment difficult to the detriment of American and foreign companies,” Mr. Furman said. “Foreign direct investment is an important part of the strength of the U.S. economy.” Of note: Qualcomm spent far more than Broadcom on lobbying. Broadcom officially withdrew its bid this morning. Advertisement What’s next for Qualcomm: The chip maker’s Hail Mary — petitioning the government for a national-security review of Broadcom’s bid — paid off handsomely. But now it has to show investors that it can fix its business. Peter Eavis’s take: National champions have to deliver. Will Qualcomm become less efficient under the government’s protection? If so, U.S. tax payers may feel taken advantage of. Elsewhere in semiconductors: The industry largely ignored a short seller’s report on purported security flaws in AMD chips. (Axios) President Trump announced his metals tariffs to protect American makers of aluminum and steel. But that could put Boeing in the firing line — America’s top exporter, which employs nearly as many people as the U.S. steel and aluminum industries combined. More from Natalie Kitroeff of the NYT: “I’m really worried about what it’s going to do to us,” said James Springer, a mechanic who installs stow bins and class dividers on 787 Dreamliners at Boeing’s plant in North Charleston, S.C. “What will the E.U. and China do, especially China? They are one of our biggest customers now.” And Mr. Trump’s attacks on Chinese metal production are in some ways a relic of past trade battles, as Beijing moves away from basic commodities. Elsewhere in trade: Marco Rubio argues in an NYT Op-Ed that the U.S. should take measures more targeted than the tariffs to punish China for unfair trade practices.

6-Mar-18,"Advertisement By REUTERSMARCH 6, 2018, 11:42 A.M. E.S.T.
 NAIROBI —  When Sebastian Mikosz took over as CEO of loss-making Kenya Airways last June, he immediately shut its outlet in Nairobi's downmarket Accra Road, which served thousands of small traders who fly to the Far East to buy cheap goods in bulk. The move marked the beginning of an aggressive hunt for cost savings and premium passengers, after years of losses following a slump in tourism and large debts incurred to buy new aircraft. Polish native Mikosz, who helped turn around flag carrier LOT Polish Airlines as its chief executive, needs to stem those losses before it can begin to pay down $2 billion of debt restructured in November to stave off the airline's collapse. He told Reuters he plans to roll out a new economy plus class by the end of the year designed for business and wealthy leisure travelers, including growing numbers of American tourists and executives from dozens of Nairobi-based U.S. firms. Advertisement Coming first to wide-bodied planes, it will mean new seats with the same capacity by using space between them. ""We are working on a pretty big reshape of the onboard experience,"" Mikosz said. Advertisement The airline also plans a direct route to the Indian Ocean luxury tourism island of Mauritius and the first direct flight from Nairobi to New York by any airline from October, a plan Mikosz said was known as the ""$100 million project"" for the revenue the daily flight is expected to bring in. The U.S. route will compete with indirect flights from established players such as Emirates [EMIRA.UL], British Airways and Ethiopian Airlines [ETHA.UL] and test Kenya Airways' ability to reshape its image from an Africa-focused carrier. ""We still have to prove that we can produce an operating profit,"" Mikosz said in an interview in his office overlooking airport service hangers. ""That is the biggest challenge that we have in an environment where you have a lot of competition."" Twenty five foreign airlines operate out of Nairobi's main airport, including Turkish Airlines which is expanding in Africa and state-owned Emirates, South African Airways and Ethiopian. Mikosz describes this state-backed competition as his biggest fear as he tries to turn around a publicly listed firm owned 48.9 percent by the government and 7.8 percent by Air France/KLM and attract a strategic investor. ""It is really sometimes very frustrating when you see that somebody can have much lower costs thanks to this protected environment and you have to face a real free market economy,"" he said. HEADWINDS His plans mark a shift from a focus on African air passenger demand, which the International Air Transport Association (IATA) sees growing by almost 6 percent a year over the next decade due to increasing economic output and poor road and rail links. Advertisement Kenya hosts regional hubs for 48 U.S. or U.S.-based businesses like Google and IBM and the United States is the fastest-growing source of tourists, many changing planes in Europe or the Gulf in more than 20-hour trips. Jan Mohamed, chief executive of TPS Eastern Africa, which runs the Serena chain of luxury hotels and safari lodges, said people would pay extra for direct flights, which take about 15 hours.  . Tickets to New York have begun retailing for around $1,000 return, compared with about $1,500 for an indirect flight. A former executive at Kenya Airways, who helped return it to profitability after years of losses in the early 1990s, said the new strategy was sensible, but held some risks. ""The money is in the business part of the operation. The leisure side will give you volume but it gives you volume at low rates,"" he said, cautioning that the airline must be careful not to undermine Sky Team Alliance partners like Delta and Air France KLM, which feed it passengers from America. Mikosz said there was plenty of room. The potential to Europe is ""very big,"" he said, adding that he planned to add a second daily flight to Amsterdam in high season alongside KLM. Forty-year-old Kenya Airlines, which flies to 53 destinations with 38 Boeing and Embraer planes, has not said when it will return to profit. It lost 80 engineers to higher paying Mideast rivals before the restructuring and Mikosz, who says the U.S. route will create 150 new jobs, fired 140 technical staff after a strike in November. Politics provides other headwinds. Kenya only got U.S. security clearance a year ago after a major refurbishment of Nairobi's main airport and the United States extended a warning last week over the threat to aviation from militant activity in eastern Kenya, which borders Somalia. Advertisement The company, which reports full-year results in June, had a $251 million loss in the financial year 2016-17 and negative equity of 45 billion shillings. The government restructured its debt in November, converting loans to build up its stake from just under a third to preserve a national carrier that serves the vital tourism sector and growing foreign investment. Shareholders found their holdings diluted 95 percent by the restructuring but shares more than tripled to 18.50 shillings ($0.1829) before dropping back by around four shillings. The government has guaranteed some of the airline's debts and Mikosz and his team have 10 years to clear them. ""Sell more tickets and cut costs,"" said the CEO, who has headed up major Central European online travel agent eSky.pl as well as helping to rescue LOT from bankruptcy. ""It's always the same game."" (Additional reporting by Tim Hepher and Victoria Bryan; editing by Katharine Houreld and Philippa Fletcher) We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

 President Trump’s announcement that he planned to impose steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum delighted some blue-collar industries he had championed. “Enthusiastic and gratified are probably understatements,” said Michael A. Bless, the president of Century Aluminum. Behemoth steel buyers like Boeing and General Motors weren’t as pleased. Their shares fell on the news, and the most obvious aluminum dependents — the brewing giants Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors — warned about the risk of job losses. 
            We buy as much domestic can sheet aluminum as is available, however, there simply isn’t enough supply to satisfy the demands of American beverage makers like us. American workers and American consumers will suffer as a result ofthis misguided tariff. (3/3)         But it is people like H. O. Woltz III who feel most vulnerable. Mr. Woltz is the chairman and chief executive of Insteel Industries, which operates 10 plants from Arizona to Pennsylvania producing steel wire products for concrete reinforcing. He has about 1,000 workers, most without college degrees. “The jobs that we have are good jobs,” Mr. Woltz said. “Our guys make a lot of money.” Now his business calculus is being upended. A tariff on imports also allows domestic steel and aluminum producers to charge higher prices, affecting manufacturers across the United States. Advertisement As industrial America sorts out the tariffs’ prospective impact, one thing is clear: The divide between the metal producers and their customers slices directly through Mr. Trump’s blue-collar constituency. Advertisement Mr. Trump argues that free trade has hollowed out America’s industrial base and saddled the country with huge trade deficits. He has promised to recover lost ground with an “America first” trade policy. But putting America first may not put all American workers ahead. “There are more losers than winners,” said Monica de Bolle, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “If the point is to protect American jobs, if the point is to protect small and medium-sized businesses, this is exactly the wrong way to do things.” The mills and smelters that supply the raw material, and that would directly benefit from the tariffs, have been shrinking for years. Today, those industries employ fewer than 200,000 people. The companies that buy steel and aluminum, to make everything from trucks to chicken coops, employ more than 6.5 million workers, according to a Heritage Foundation analysis of Commerce Department data. Mr. Woltz, who is based in North Carolina, counts himself among hundreds of specialized businesses that will bear the brunt of the tariffs. He pays around $20 an hour on average, and he has been able to increase his payroll despite stiff competition from abroad. If you have seen a bridge being hoisted over a highway in the last 20 years, he said, you probably caught a glimpse of Insteel’s handiwork. The wire product he makes is not unique, though, and he fears that if he has to charge commercial builders more, he will lose business to foreign competitors paying much less for their raw materials. “If the customers have the option of purchasing from Malaysians or Colombians, who don’t have to pay that extra cost, that’s what they are going to do,” Mr. Woltz said. Advertisement He buys most of his raw material from domestic mills, but he expects them to raise prices as their foreign competitors are hit by tariffs of up to 25 percent. Right now, he pays around $600 per ton of steel wire rod. The impact of a 25 percent tariff would add $150 to that price. He makes only $40 in profit per ton, though, so the math would destroy his balance sheet. It is not clear yet whether employers like Mr. Woltz will cut jobs because of the tariffs. Economic growth has been strong, and the corporate tax cut will give companies more cash to work with. “We think the dial won’t move that much,” said Atsi Sheth, an economist at Moody’s Investors Service. “You are likely to gain jobs in a few sectors, but lose them in others.” President George W. Bush imposed tariffs of up to 30 percent on steel imports in 2002, intending them to last three years, but lifted them earlier than expected after European trading partners threatened to retaliate. One retrospective study found that higher steel prices cost more jobs than the number of people employed in the industry at the time. In the long haul, tariffs may also hurt the industries they’re supposed to prop up, Ms. Sheth said. “Even the sectors that are protected over time become less efficient because they have to work less hard,” she said. But for now, the mood at Century Aluminum is jubilant. “Finally we have got an administration who is willing to say, ‘It might make a lot of people around the world mad, but if we don’t do it now, then when?’” said Mr. Bless, Century’s president. The tariff on aluminum, prospectively 10 percent, would allow Mr. Bless to restart some production of high-purity aluminum for military use at Century’s plant in Hawesville, Ky., which it partly shut three years ago, he said. He plans to hire 300 people this year on top of the 1,850 he already employs and invest more than $100 million in the smelting operation. Advertisement “These are jobs that are sorely needed,” Mr. Bless said. That is the kind of response that labor unions have been waiting for. Leo W. Gerard, the president of the United Steelworkers union, which also represents aluminum workers, said his members were tired of enduring layoffs because of an onslaught of artificially cheap steel and aluminum produced by “cheaters” in China.  . “Some of these idiots that say we are going to start a trade war — well, we are in a trade war now, and we are just sitting back,” Mr. Gerard said. His union represents more than 200,000 Canadian workers, though, and Mr. Gerard said he hoped Mr. Trump would not apply the tariff to Canada. “We didn’t want to — and didn’t ask the administration to — alienate those countries that don’t cheat,” Mr. Gerard said, citing Canada and European countries among the virtuous. Economists say it is unlikely that the tariffs would lead to a steel hiring boom. The industry has hemorrhaged jobs over the last half-century, but research suggests that is largely because of technological innovation. In any case, economists say, any gains would probably be offset by the pain inflicted on smaller players down the supply chain. John T. Johnson’s company is one of them. Mr. Johnson runs a family business out of Nashville, Mid-South Wire Company, which his father founded 51 years ago. He has 150 employees, who all get a 401(k) retirement plan and health insurance. They tend to spend their careers at the company, turning hot-rolled wire rod into dishwasher racks, shopping carts and bucket handles. Mr. Johnson used to make a lot of barbecue grills, he said. Then Chinese manufacturers got into the game, flooding the market with cheap alternatives. Char-Broil grill production moved from Georgia to China. Others followed. Mr. Johnson had to find new products to replace that business. Advertisement “You can hardly find an American-made barbecue grill now,” Mr. Johnson said. “They are all imported.” The experience taught him that his hold on the market would last only as long as his price advantage, which would slip away with tariffs. “When you have a situation like this, that creates the opportunity for these products to go offshore,” he said. If his sales are badly hurt by the tariffs, Mr. Johnson will lay people off, notwithstanding any tax-cut benefits. “I have to make money to pay taxes,” he said glumly. To him, it feels as if the administration cares only about the people melting and hot-rolling steel, and not those turning that material into the racks at a hardware store or the products sitting on them. “We are steel workers, too,” he said. “Our jobs and our livelihood are centered around steel just as much as the steel mills.” A version of this article appears in print on March 4, 2018, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Plan for Tariffs Creates Divide In Trump Base.

 NAIROBI —  When Sebastian Mikosz took over as CEO of loss-making Kenya Airways last June, he immediately shut its outlet in Nairobi's downmarket Accra Road, which served thousands of small traders who fly to the Far East to buy cheap goods in bulk. The move marked the beginning of an aggressive hunt for cost savings and premium passengers, after years of losses following a slump in tourism and large debts incurred to buy new aircraft. Polish native Mikosz, who helped turn around flag carrier LOT Polish Airlines as its chief executive, needs to stem those losses before it can begin to pay down $2 billion (1.44 billion pounds) of debt restructured in November to stave off the airline's collapse. He told Reuters he plans to roll out a new economy plus class by the end of the year designed for business and wealthy leisure travellers, including growing numbers of American tourists and executives from dozens of Nairobi-based U.S. firms. Advertisement Coming first to wide-bodied planes, it will mean new seats with the same capacity by using space between them. ""We are working on a pretty big reshape of the onboard experience,"" Mikosz said. Advertisement The airline also plans a direct route to the Indian Ocean luxury tourism island of Mauritius and the first direct flight from Nairobi to New York by any airline from October, a plan Mikosz said was known as the ""$100 million project"" for the revenue the daily flight is expected to bring in. The U.S. route will compete with indirect flights from established players such as Emirates [EMIRA.UL], British Airways and Ethiopian Airlines [ETHA.UL] and test Kenya Airways' ability to reshape its image from an Africa-focused carrier. ""We still have to prove that we can produce an operating profit,"" Mikosz said in an interview in his office overlooking airport service hangers. ""That is the biggest challenge that we have in an environment where you have a lot of competition.""

7-Mar-18,"Advertisement By ERIC LIPTON and DANIELLE IVORYMARCH 7, 2018
 One appointee went from “battleground states” director for the Trump presidential campaign to a role at the State Department that sent him to South Africa to meet with health officials. Another traded in her campaign experience as a field director in Virginia for a federal job promoting nuclear energy sales abroad. And another, who spent four months on the campaign in New York after graduating from college, landed a job as an aide to the commerce secretary with a résumé that included work as a receptionist at an animal hospital and a summer job at a country club’s golf shop. The three newly minted federal employees are among the nearly 260 or so former Trump campaign and inauguration workers who have gotten jobs reserved for political appointees in the administration, according to public records compiled by ProPublica and analyzed by The New York Times. Advertisement In all, more than 2,475 political appointees have joined the federal government since President Trump took office, including at least 187 former lobbyists and also 125 people with ties to conservative think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute, the records show. Advertisement A database of the employees, assembled through hundreds of open records requests, has been posted online by ProPublica. It offers a comprehensive look at how Mr. Trump is influencing the direction of the federal government, beyond high-profile cabinet appointments and other Senate-confirmed posts, and how he has rewarded people who have been loyal to him or share his priorities. Handing out political jobs to former campaign workers, like-minded experts, lawyers and erstwhile lobbyists is a grand tradition in Washington, where, to the victor, go the spoils. Each president has about 4,000 political posts to fill; separately, there are two million civilian federal workers who are largely hired through a competitive process. Just over a year into his presidency, Mr. Trump has yet to formally nominate candidates for nearly 35 percent of the 639 positions needing Senate confirmation, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit group that tracks federal appointments. Mr. Trump arrived at the White House without a large contingent of well-known Washington names at the ready, and some jobs have been filled with people new to government or lacking experience in the fields where they now work, according to a review of financial disclosures. No comparative database exists from previous administrations, but scholars and other experts on presidential transitions say the Trump appointments stand out. “Overall, my reading is that the Trump political appointees have less expertise, in their respective areas, than any presidential administration dating back to at least the Reagan era,” said Thomas E. Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who reviewed the database. Mr. Mann has specialized in federal government studies for four decades and has tracked the process that previous administrations have used to fill political jobs. Lindsay Walters, deputy White House press secretary, said the administration had appointed well-qualified staff. “The president selects the highest caliber of individuals from an array of backgrounds and experiences to fill positions in his administration,” she said in a statement. “We are proud that these individuals — whether they worked on the campaign, conservative think tanks or elsewhere — share the president’s vision that got him elected.” Advertisement Agency officials added that these new political hires had brought value to government. For instance, Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement that Matthew Mowers, the former Trump campaign official who recently traveled to South Africa, provided a “fresh focus and renewed passion for helping women, children and men who are living with H.I.V./AIDS.” Mr. Mowers, who had also worked on the presidential campaign of Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, is chief of staff in the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator. Last month, he tweeted from South Africa, “Great meeting today with Ministry of Health Officials in Johannesburg.” One of the top sources of the appointees has been the presidential campaign, according to the database. Some of the people listed in the database have already left the Trump administration, but it offers a snapshot of those hired for political jobs in the past year. At the White House alone, there have been almost 60 former campaign workers. In addition, about 20 have been hired at the Energy Department, and another 20 or so at the Commerce Department. Some of the Commerce jobs have been filled with people who have extensive experience in government or the private sector. One of them is Mira Ricardel, the under secretary for export administration, whose career includes stints at Boeing, at the Defense Department and on Capitol Hill. During the campaign, she was a consultant to Trump for America.  . Others hired at the Commerce Department had limited work experience. Jonathan Wardell, the aide in the secretary’s office, graduated in 2016 from Stony Brook University in New York. William Reinert, who works in the public affairs office, graduated from Troy University in Alabama in 2016; his résumé cites six months with the Trump campaign and other short-term jobs, including on Capitol Hill. The former campaign field worker who now promotes sales of nuclear energy equipment abroad is Cameron Dorsey, a 2014 graduate of Washington and Lee University in Virginia who also worked briefly for the Republican National Committee and a political consulting firm, according to her financial disclosure form. The Commerce Department did not comment on the experience level of some of its recent hires. But Secretary Wilbur L. Ross Jr. said in a statement that the department sought the best candidates for positions, adding, “It is important that young people show interest and get involved in public service.” At the State Department, political appointees include Taylor Bush, whose title is listed as special assistant. Mr. Bush was a field director for the campaign in Fairfax, Va., and also worked on the inaugural committee and at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. The only other recent source of income listed on his financial disclosure form was a bartending job at the Hamilton Restaurant in Washington. “The work of a special assistant requires someone who has good interpersonal skills, is well organized and who can handle multiple assignments simultaneously,” the State Department spokeswoman said in a statement. “Taylor Bush is a hard worker — he proved himself in these areas during the campaign and, as a result, was asked to join the State Department.” Advertisement The former lobbyists who have joined the administration include some who recently lobbied the agencies where they now work. Melissa F. Burnison, for example, was in February confirmed as an assistant secretary for congressional affairs at the Energy Department. As recently as the fourth quarter of last year, Ms. Burnison was involved in lobbying the department on behalf of the Nuclear Energy Institute, which represents the nuclear industry, according to lobbying disclosures. An Energy spokeswoman said Ms. Burnison “will continue to comply with guidelines, waiver or no waiver.” Without an ethics waiver, she is prohibited from working on issues with which she was previously involved. The administration has granted at least 31 waivers to some former lobbyists and others who had private-sector jobs that overlap with their new federal assignments, according to the database. Among them is Erik Baptist, a senior deputy general counsel at the Environmental Protection Agency. He previously worked for the American Petroleum Institute as a lobbyist on federal regulations related to renewable fuels. The appointees from conservative research and advocacy groups reflect Mr. Trump’s right-leaning politics. The Heritage Foundation tops the list, according to the ProPublica tally, with at least 25 former employees now working for the administration. Next is Freedom Partners, a nonprofit group led by the general counsel of Koch Industries, with 16 people who were compensated by the organization. They are among about 35 Trump political appointees who worked for or consulted with different groups affiliated with the billionaire libertarian brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch. The conservative appointees are spread across the government. At the Interior Department, Ryan Nichols is an adviser in the Office of Water and Science, after coordinating the Heritage Foundation’s work with a group of climate change skeptics called the “Cooler Heads Coalition.” Also from the Heritage Foundation is Steven Groves, who works at the White House after writing forcefully against international agreements in collaboration with groups like the United Nations Human Rights Council. It is an open question whether the tradition of filling lower-level political jobs with people loyal to the president, or at least grateful for a job, has much influence on policy. After all, the 4,000 positions account for a fraction of 1 percent of the federal work force. “Most of them were excellent, some not so good,” said Eric L. Hirschhorn, a political appointee in the Commerce Department during much of the Obama administration. Because political appointees are not subject to civil service rules, he added, there was one advantage if they did not meet expectations. “It was a lot easier to get rid them,” he said.

1-Mar-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin MARCH 1, 2018
 Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching: • The markets and Trump’s tariffs. • Jared Kushner is criticized for meetings with business moguls who later helped his family’s company. • Stephen Schwarzman had a good 2017. • Walmart is the latest business to wade into the gun debate. • And Spotify opens its books ahead of its direct listing. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Investors might be tempted to take a trade skirmish in stride. When President George W. Bush slapped high tariffs on steel imports 16 years ago, the stock market slipped a bit but recovered in the following days. Likewise, stocks may bounce back from the decline that followed the news on Thursday that President Trump will soon introduce tariffs on steel and aluminum. Advertisement In recent years, the global economic order appeared to be under threat a number of times. But stock markets rebounded from Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, Europe’s sovereign debt crisis, and the debt-ceiling clashes in the United States. Advertisement And there is a good chance that President Trump’s tariffs won’t cause a great deal of collateral economic damage. They may end up being softer than Thursday’s headlines suggest, as globalists push back. And like President Bush’s tariffs, President Trump’s may be quite narrow in focus and exist for a relatively short period. Investors could learn to live with those, just as they’ve mostly shrugged off possible changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement. But vulnerabilities exist right now that could magnify any negative impact of President Trump’s tariffs. The stock market is still highly valued after a searing rally that took it to an all-time high in January. The Federal Reserve expects to increase interest rates multiple times this year. Compare that with March 2002, when President Bush introduced his trade restrictions: The Fed was cutting interest rates, a policy stance that can help support the economy and the stock market; stocks were nowhere near their peak of two years earlier; and President Bush’s administration was, overall, globalist in its outlook and didn’t want to become isolated ahead of the Iraq war. Importantly, the United States economy is less dominant than it was 16 years ago. Last year, the United States accounted for an estimated 24 percent of the world’s gross domestic product, using data from the International Monetary Fund. In 2002, the share was 32 percent. If other countries retaliate, and tariffs broaden, the United States’ economy may be less resilient than some in the Trump administration may believe. — Peter Eavis We asked yesterday if his family’s real estate business was his biggest liability. Our colleagues’ latest story shows that might be the case. What happened • Josh Harris of Apollo Global Management, an adviser on infrastructure issues, met with Mr. Kushner several times last year. In November, Apollo lent $184 million to Kushner Companies, triple the size of the investment firm’s average property loan. • Citigroup’s C.E.O., Michael Corbat, met with Mr. Kushner in the spring, and shortly afterward the bank lent Kushner Companies $325 million. Advertisement Mr. Kushner, his family business, Apollo and Citi all said that nothing improper had happened. But the meetings raise questions about how the Kushner Companies is weighing down the political fortunes of President Trump’s son-in-law. Mr. Kushner has already had his interim security clearance downgraded amid a feud with the White House chief of staff, John Kelly. The WSJ editorial board writes, “Mr. Kushner and Ivanka have to decide if they’d serve themselves and the president better by walking away from their formal White House roles.” The politics flyaround • The White House is set to announce new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, according to unidentified sources. (Bloomberg) • Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and one of Mr. Trump’s closest aides, plans to step down. (NYT) • Mr. Trump publicly criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions as “DISGRACEFUL” for not ordering his own investigation into the handling of the Russia inquiry. (NYT) From Ana Swanson of the NYT: President Trump said on Thursday that he will impose stiff and sweeping tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum as he moved to fulfill a key campaign promise to get tough on foreign competitors. Mr. Trump said he would formally sign the trade measures next week and promised they would be in effect “for a long period of time.” The trade measures would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. It is unclear whether those would apply to all imports or be targeted toward specific countries, like China, which have been flooding the United States with cheap metals. The announcement capped a frenetic and chaotic morning inside the White House as Mr. Trump summoned more than a dozen executives from the steel and aluminum industry to the White House, raising expectations that he would announce his long-promised tariffs. However, the legal review of the trade measure was not yet complete and, as of Thursday morning, White House advisers were still discussing various scenarios for tariff levels and which countries could be included, according to people familiar with the deliberations. U.S. stock markets slipped around the time Mr. Trump made his comments about tariffs, with declines in the industrial sector outpacing the overall market. The Standard & Poor’s 500 industrial sector was down more than 2 percent, compared to the overall benchmark index which was down a bit less than 1 percent as of around 1:30 p.m. Automakers, large consumers of steel and aluminum, fell sharply. Another large consumer of those materials, aircraft maker Boeing also declined. As the country’s largest exporter, Boeing would also likely be affected by rising global trade tensions if other nations responded to tariffs from the United States. The comments also come on the same day as Bill Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve, said this about protectionism: “There are many approaches to dealing with the costs of globalization, but protectionism is a dead end. Trade restrictions address the symptoms and not the underlying problems, and they introduce other costs and distortions. While such measures might generate a temporary boost to growth from greater domestic production and consumption, these would likely be offset by a range of other costs. Over time, such measures would retard productivity growth and thereby shrink the economic pie.” The co-founder and chief executive of Blackstone raked in $786.5 million last year, his biggest take-home ever, according to Bloomberg. His stake in New York-based Blackstone—and the $661 million in dividends it yielded—fueled much of the payout. The rest came from his cut of deal profits, salary and other compensation, according to the filing. In 2016, Schwarzman got $425 million. By comparison • Apollo’s Leon Black took home $191.3 million • Carlyle co-founders David Rubenstein, Bill Conway and Dan D’Aniello divvied up a combined payout of $193 million. Advertisement • KKR’s Henry Kravis and George Roberts received a combined $343 million. Jerome Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, said before the Senate Banking Committee: “We don’t see any strong evidence yet of a decisive move up in wages. We see wages by a couple of measures trending up a little bit, but most of them continuing to grow at two and a half percent. Nothing is suggesting to me that wage inflation is at a point of accelerating. I would expect that some continued strengthening in the labor market can take place without causing inflation.” Context Mr. Powell said the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday that the outlook for the United States economy had brightened in recent months. He added that the Fed expected to continue raising rates gradually and could even pick up the pace. The markets seemed to interpret the remarks as signaling the Fed would be more aggressive than expected in raising rates. But there was more evidence Thursday morning that inflation may accelerate this year.  Here are the  numbers from the Commerce Department: • Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 0.4 percent. • That was the biggest increase since September.In the 12 months through January, the PCE price index rose 1.7 percent. • So-called core PCE, which excludes food and energy, the PCE advanced 0.3 percent in January — the largest gain since January 2017. • Year-over-year core PCE, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, rose at 1.5 percent in January. • The core PCE price index has undershot the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target since mid-2012. Just as the company isn’t holding a traditional I.P.O., it isn’t holding the usual kind of marketing road show either.

Here’s what to expect, from the company’s prospectus: We will prepare an electronic presentation for this investor day, which will have content similar to a traditional roadshow presentation, and make one version of the presentation publicly available, without restriction, on a website. There can be no guarantees that the investor day and other investor education meetings will have the same impact on investor education as a traditional “roadshow” conducted in connection with an underwritten initial public offering. Spotify adds that it will hold additional “investor education meetings,” which would likely be reserved for the most important investors.

It was one thing for Dick’s Sporting Goods to set an age requirement for firearms sales. It’s another for the country’s biggest gun seller to do something similar. What each is doing: Walmart: Raising the minimum age for purchases of guns or ammunition to 21, and eliminating products that look like assault-style rifles. (The company stopped selling AR-15s two years ago.) Dick’s: Requiring buyers to be at least 21 and dropping AR-15s from its 35 Field and Stream outlets.

1-Mar-18,"Advertisement By ANA SWANSONMARCH 1, 2018
 WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Thursday that he would impose stiff tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum, making good on a key campaign promise and rattling stock markets as the prospect of a global trade fight appeared imminent. (You can read more about Friday’s developments here.) In a hastily arranged meeting with industry executives that stunned many inside the West Wing, Mr. Trump said he would formally sign the trade measures next week and promised they would be in effect “for a long period of time.” The action, which came against the wishes of Mr. Trump’s pro-trade advisers, would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, effectively placing a tax on every foreign shipment of those metals into the United States. The president told more than a dozen executives that he wanted the tariffs to apply to all countries, one executive in attendance said. Mr. Trump argued that if one country was exempt, all other countries would line up to ask for similar treatment, and that metals could end up being shipped to the United States through exempted countries. Mr. Trump’s authority to impose such sweeping tariffs stems from a Commerce Department investigation that concluded last month that imported metal threatened national security by degrading the American industrial base. The administration has said it wants to combat cheap metals flooding into the United States, particularly from China, but a broad set of tariffs would fall most heavily on allies, especially Canada, which supplies steel and aluminum to American companies as well as the military. Advertisement “People have no idea how badly our country has been treated by other countries,” Mr. Trump said on Thursday. “They’ve destroyed the steel industry, they’ve destroyed the aluminum industry, and other industries, frankly.” Advertisement “We’re bringing it all back,” he added. Friday morning, Mr. Trump tweeted that a trade war would be a positive development in the context of the United States’ current position with its trading partners. 
            When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore-we win big. It’s easy!         Stocks fell in response to the potential tariffs, with declines in the industrial sector outpacing the overall market. The Standard & Poor’s 500 industrial sector was down 1.9 percent, compared with a decline of about 1.3 percent in the overall benchmark index. Shares of American automakers, all large consumers of steel and aluminum, declined, as did shares of Boeing, a large exporter that could be hurt if other nations retaliate against United States tariffs. Mr. Trump’s announcement came despite months of heavy pushback from American companies that use metals in their products, like automakers and food packagers, and foreign officials, who warned that tariffs would strain relations and could prompt retaliatory trade actions. It also elicited a swift and severe response from Republican lawmakers, who said the action would ultimately hurt American companies, workers, consumers and the economy. The announcement capped a frenetic and chaotic morning as Mr. Trump summoned more than a dozen executives from the steel and aluminum industry to the White House, raising expectations that he would announce his long-promised tariffs. 
            A tariff on steel imports would have a greater effect on some other countries that export more of it to the United States than China.         ORIGIN OF U.S. STEEL IMPORTS 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20.

 Mr. Trump raised the specter of action with an early morning Twitter post, saying: “Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer.” Yet the legal review of the trade measure had not been completed and, as of Thursday morning, White House advisers were still discussing various outcomes for tariff levels and which countries could be included, according to people familiar with the deliberations. Just an hour before Mr. Trump made his remarks, a White House spokeswoman said that no announcement was expected that morning. Advisers have been bitterly divided over how to proceed on the tariffs, including whether to impose them broadly on all steel and aluminum imports, which would ensnare allies like the European Union and Canada, or whether to tailor them more narrowly to target specific countries. Advertisement Imposing tough sanctions would fulfill the president’s promises but could tip off trade wars around the world as other countries seek to retaliate against the United States. Foreign governments, multinational companies and the Pentagon have continued to push against broad tariffs, arguing that the measures could disrupt economic and security ties. Brazil, Canada, Germany, Mexico and South Korea were the largest suppliers of steel to the United States in 2017, while Canada, Russia and the United Arab Emirates shipped the largest share of aluminum imports in 2016. On Thursday, Canada, the European Union and other countries said they might have no choice but to retaliate in response. The president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, called the measure “blatant intervention to protect U.S. domestic industry” and said the European Union had been a close security ally of the United States for decades. “We will not sit idly while our industry is hit with unfair measures that put thousands of European jobs at risk,” Mr. Juncker said. Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian minister of foreign affairs, called any measure that deemed Canadian trade a national security threat “entirely inappropriate.” “Should restrictions be imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum products, Canada will take responsive measures to defend its trade interests and workers,” she said.  . That is the exact situation Mr. Trump’s pro-trade advisers have long feared and worked to prevent. Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, had been lobbying for months alongside others, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Rob Porter, the staff secretary who recently resigned under pressure from the White House, to kill, postpone or at least narrow the scope of the measures, people familiar with the discussions said. But in recent weeks, a group of White House advisers who advocate a tougher posture on trade has been in ascendance, including Robert E. Lighthizer, the country’s top trade negotiator and a former steel industry lawyer; Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary who led the metals investigation; and Peter Navarro, a trade skeptic who had been sidelined but is now in line for a promotion. Advertisement Mr. Cohn threatened to resign if the White House followed through with stiff and sweeping tariffs, according to people who have spoken with him in recent days. The departure of Mr. Porter, who organized weekly trade policy meetings and coordinated the trade advisers, has helped fuel a chaotic situation that has descended into an all-out war among various trade advisers, people close to the White House said. The White House has been on the brink of announcing steel and aluminum tariffs several times in the past eight months, including in June. In recent days, the president appears to have grown impatient for action. Supporters of the tariffs have begun broadcasting televised ads in recent days during programs that Mr. Trump has been known to watch. One such ad ran on Fox News minutes before the president’s Twitter post on Thursday morning. But the tariffs have divided industries, workers and policymakers. American manufacturers of steel and aluminum pressed the White House to take action against cheap imports, which they say hurt their ability to compete. Companies that use steel and aluminum in their products say tariffs would raise their costs, eating into profits or forcing them to raise prices or lay off workers. Scott N. Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which represents steel companies and workers, said the president made “an encouraging show of support” on Thursday morning but now needed to act. “The president’s enforcement action must be broad, robust and comprehensive,” Mr. Paul said. Republican lawmakers blasted the announcement, underlining how far Mr. Trump has strayed from the party’s traditional orthodoxy of embracing free and open markets. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, called tariffs “a tax hike the American people don’t need and can’t afford.” “Let’s be clear: The president is proposing a massive tax increase on American families,” said Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska. “You’d expect a policy this bad from a leftist administration, not a supposedly Republican one.” Advertisement But Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, defended the president, calling the announcement a “long overdue” action for steelworkers in his state. The prospect of tariffs seemed likely to incite a period of fierce lobbying by foreign governments and multinational companies who will argue that their products should be exempted from any sanctions. It could also result in protracted fight at the World Trade Organization. The World Trade Organization provides substantial leeway for countries to pursue trade measures in their national security interest, but few countries have tested those permissions. Jennifer A. Hillman, a professor at Georgetown Law, said she expected countries to bring challenges and that the outcome could be negative, whether the United States wins or loses. A ruling against the United States might feed an opinion already popular in the Trump administration that global trade rules compromise American sovereignty, and provide a reason to potentially withdraw from the organization. Even a ruling in Washington’s favor could prompt others to follow the United States in using national security concerns to justify a vast array of measures to shut off their own markets from American products. “Arguably every other country in the world can do the same thing,” Ms. Hillman said. “You’ve really now walked away from a rules-based trading system.” Matt Phillips contributed reporting from New York.

15-Mar-18,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin MARCH 15, 2018
 Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Wells Fargo’s C.E.O. gets a pay raise. • Peter Thiel discusses trade. • Theranos’s fall is nearly complete. • Why John Skipper left ESPN abruptly. • Alibaba is exploring a China listing. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. There will be no roadshow. No ringing of the bell. No party or C.E.O interview from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Spotify, the streaming music service, is eschewing the traditional initial public offering for a direct listing and is taking its pitch directly to retail investors, streaming its presentation on its website Thursday. Advertisement Here are a few takeaways: Why a direct listing? The post-I.P.O. lockup period, during which employees can’t sell shares. “We have allowed shareholders and employees to buy and sell stock for years,” said Daniel Ek, Spotify’s C.E.O.and founder, said. “That shouldn’t stop just because our stock is more widely owned.” Advertisement The company is also well capitalized with positive free cash flow and no debt. Room to Grow? The number of smartphone users to continues to grow but Spotify said it only reaches a small portion within the countries it operates. The company is also working with auto makers to integrate its platform with cars, where more than 30 percent of music listening happens. Apple and Amazon are a big risk to Spotify’s business? Tech giants like Apple, Amazon and Google each have their own streaming music services. Spotify’s service is delivered over Apple’s iPhone and Amazon’s Echo. Those companies could prioritize their own services on their devices. What is the next date to watch? March 26. That’s the date when Spotify will release first-quarter results and 2018 guidance. What is “algotorial?” It’s the term that Spotify’s head of research and development used to describe the mix of algorithms and humans that Spotify uses to curate its music. Regulators recently penalized Wells Fargo for years of misconduct, but on Wednesday, the bank gave its C.E.O. a hearty pay rise. How did that happen? The numbers: Timothy J. Sloan’s compensation for 2017 totaled $17.6 million, a 35 percent increase from the $13 million he earned in 2016. His stock award for 2017 was $15 million, a big jump from $10.5 million in 2016. Is the increase justified, given the bank’s issues? Wells Fargo would no doubt point to the fact that Mr. Sloan decided to forgo a cash bonus in 2017. John G. Stumpf, a former C.E.O., got a $4 million cash bonus in 2015, for instance. Also, Mr. Sloan’s stock award was set in February last year and reflects his promotion in 2016 to C.E.O. And if Wells Fargo slips up badly over the next three years, Mr. Sloan may not get the entire $15 million stock award. Advertisement How does Mr. Sloan’s pay stack up against others? He is making less than the C.E.O. of Bank of America, Brian T. Moynihan, who made $21.8 million last year. But Mr. Sloan is making quite a bit more than the chief executives of large regional banks. US Bank’s chief executive, Andrew Cecere, had 2017 compensation of $12 million. But Mr. Sloan looks overpaid on a new metric that public companies must provide. This yardstick compares a C.E.O.’s pay with that of the median employee’s pay. Mr. Sloan’s 2017 pay was 291 times that of Wells Fargo’s median earner. That is above the 250 times for Mr. Moynihan. And Mr. Sloan’s ratio is far in excess of Mr. Cecere’s 205 times. — Peter Eavis One of President Trump’s most prominent supporters in the business world on Thursday said the United States would have the upper hand against China in a trade skirmish. Peter Thiel, a technology entrepreneur with libertarian leanings, told the Economic Club of New York that the United States doesn’t export enough to China to make it vulnerable to Chinese retaliation. If Mr. Trump imposed trade restrictions on Chinese goods, as he may in the coming weeks, China could do the same to United States exports. Mr. Thiel seemed unfazed by that. “It’s quite unclear where China can reciprocate because we are exporting so little,” he said. Mr. Thiel’s views echo those of Mr. Trump. 
            When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore-we win big. It’s easy!         The American exports to China are not small. They totaled $184 billion in the 12 months through the end of September 2017. That makes China the United States’ fourth-largest export market after the European Union, Canada and Mexico. The United States, however, imports far more from China than it exports, which means the deficit with China is far larger than it is with Mexico and the European Union. - Peter Eavis The blood-testing start-up was once one of Silicon Valley’s most lauded unicorns. But, the S.E.C. says, it deceived investors about what its tech could do and how much business it did. And its founder Elizabeth Holmes — a Stanford dropout who was compared favorably to Steve Jobs — has been stripped of her C.E.O. title and her shares. More from John Carreyrou of the WSJ, who first reported on issues at Theranos: Many Theranos investors have lost the entire value of their investment. The losses for [Rupert] Murdoch, once the company’s largest investor, total more than $100 million, people familiar with the matter said. The S.E.C. said in its civil lawsuit Wednesday that Theranos was “on the verge of bankruptcy” in late 2017. The company has been kept afloat by a loan from a private-equity firm that is secured by Theranos’s patents. Matt Levine of Bloomberg View reminds us about the company’s other victims: patients. Peter Henning’s take: The S.E.C.’s case shows that it considers privately held companies as capable of defrauding investors as publicly traded ones. Elsewhere in S.E.C. violations: The agency charged a former Equifax executive with insider trading, saying he sold shares after learning of the company’s data breach before it was publicly reported. It’s official: The CNBC commentator will become President Trump’s chief economic adviser, replacing Gary Cohn. But what will Mr. Kudlow — who on TV is an ardent supporter of free trade — push for? Advertisement He supports a strong dollar and tariffs that make exceptions for allies like Canada and Mexico. And he’s in favor of permanently extending the Republican tax cuts for individuals. As for his stance on China, here’s what he told CNBC: “A thought that I have is the United States could lead a coalition of large trading partners and allies against China, or to let China know that they’re breaking the rules left and right.” One thing to watch for: whether his past admission of substance abuse would affect his work. “We’ll see how that plays out,” Mr. Kudlow said. Critics’ corner: Mark Hamrick, Bankrate.com’s senior economic analyst, writes, “It remains to be seen whether Kudlow can step into the role of a virtual moderating influence in this administration.” And Noah Smith of Bloomberg View asserts, “It also seems like there are just so few credible economic thinkers willing to stand up and sign their name to the Trump economic agenda.” Elsewhere in economic policy: U.S. companies have few ways around the proposed metals tariffs. And U.S. allies might emphasize their toughness against China to win tariff exemptions. Mr. Kudlow has prognosticated on many economic and political issues, often in a way that mirrors his future boss. His predictions, which will soon carry new weight as the president’s top economic adviser, have not always been on the mark. Our colleagues Deborah Solomon and Kitty Bennett take a look at some of Mr. Kudlow’s not-so-on-the-money calls. Here are a few of the ones they found: In 2005 “All the bond bears have been dead wrong in predicting sky-high mortgage rates. So have all the bubbleheads who expect housing-price crashes in Las Vegas or Naples, Fla., to bring down the consumer, the rest of the economy and the entire stock market.” (Well, we all know what happened. By 2008, home prices were in a free-fall, threatening to plunge the financial system and the economy into the abyss.) In 1993 “There’s no question that President Clinton’s across-the-board tax increases on labor, capital and energy will throw a wet blanket over the recovery and depress the economy’s long-run potential to grow.” (The period between 1990 and 1999 was the longest bull market in history. The S&P 500 more than tripled during that time.) Advertisement In 2015 “Given the recent rise of presidential candidate Donald Trump, we should all be thankful that stocks haven’t plunged. Trump’s agenda of trade protectionism, dollar devaluation, and immigrant deportation is completely anti-growth. It’s like Fortress America in an economy that is completely globalized and where the U.S. must compete in the worldwide race for capital and labor. Trump’s policies don’t fit.” (President Trump was elected and the stock market has only climbed. ) • How Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone became a close adviser to President Trump on China — but lost the tariff battle.

(NYT) An extortion plot related to his cocaine addiction. Mr. Skipper told The Hollywood Reporter: “In December, someone from whom I bought cocaine attempted to extort me.” “They threatened me, and I understood immediately that threat put me and my family at risk, and this exposure would put my professional life at risk as well. I foreclosed that possibility by disclosing the details to my family, and then when I discussed it with Bob, he and I agreed that I had placed the company in an untenable position and as a result, I should resign.” The WSJ reports that the Chinese online shopping giant is working on a plan to list shares in its home market. Such a listing would come nearly four years after Alibaba went public on the New York Stock Exchange, in what is the still the world’s largest initial public offering. Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them. . Details • A secondary listing could happen as soon as this summer, The WSJ reports. • China’s security regulators would have to change rules that bar foreign companies from listing in the country. Alibaba is incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Advertisement • China also doesn’t allow companies with dual-class share structure to list in the country. Context Alibaba’s plans come as “Chinese authorities are trying to lure some of the country’s technology stalwarts back to its capital markets,” The WSJ reports. Alibaba’s stock has jumped nearly 200 percent since it went public in 2014, gains that most Chinese investors have missed out on. Shares of Alibaba are up 3.1 percent Thursday. Christian Bittar, a former senior trader at Deutsche Bank, pleaded guilty earlier this month to conspiracy to defraud in the manipulation of a global benchmark interest rate known as Euribor, the Serious Fraud Office said on Thursday. A court in Britain lifted an order on Thursday that prevented the media from reporting his plea. “It would not be right to make comment prior to the trial of the remaining defendants and prior to Mr. Bittar’s sentencing,” David Savell, a lawyer for Mr. Bittar, said. Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $2.5 billion in penalties in 2015 related to the benchmark interest rate rigging scandal. A trial of five other traders is set for next month. - Chad Bray The Senate, in a rare show of bipartisanship, voted 67-31 to relax regulations on small to medium-sized banks. What the bill includes: • Raising the threshold for “systemically important” banks to $250 billion in assets, up from $50 billion • Exempting firms with less than $10 billion in assets from the Volcker rule But the House may want a more aggressive version that would curtail the power of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That could endanger the proposed overhaul, with the analyst Brian Gardner telling the NYT, “If the House overreaches in its effort to amend the Crapo bill, it could slow down the bill’s progress.” Elsewhere in banking: Why another Bear Stearns-like collapse isn’t likely, but another crisis is. The 70-year-old company’s plans to close or sell its stores in the U.S. and Britain show how hard life has become for bricks-and-mortar retailers. The collapse could put over 30,000 U.S. jobs at risk. Advertisement More on what happened from Michael Corkery of the NYT: Weighed down by the debt that its owners heaped on the company when they bought it, Toys “R” Us has not adequately invested in its fading stores and e-commerce operations. Unable to compete with other retailers, it has lost market share to better capitalized toy sellers. Speaking of Amazon: The company has become shorthand for “disruption” across industries. The current generation of Silicon Valley giants started out with an ethos of revolution first, fixes afterward. (Remember Facebook’s “move fast and break things” motto?) But Facebook, Google and others are becoming more bureaucratic, according to our columnist Kevin Roose — and that’s a good thing. Among the latest signs of change in their attitudes: • Facebook’s taking down accounts related to Britain First, a far-right group accused of inciting anti-Muslim hatred, and talking about the limits on its commitment to being an open platform. • YouTube plans to put info from Wikipedia alongside conspiracy videos (even if it didn’t tell the Wikimedia Foundation).
